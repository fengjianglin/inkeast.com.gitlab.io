 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1007: Bottom Of The Blood Pool</u></strong></p>
 <p>Jin Shi heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words. He exchanged glances with Jin Gu by the side. He hesitated for a moment before he slowly uttered, “The Heaven Blood Mountain Pool does indeed possess some miraculous effect of aiding one to breakthrough the bottleneck. However, the chances of this occurring are not very great. Moreover, it is only effective to some experts who have remained at the peak of the Dou Huang class for some time. However, looking at your strength, it is likely that it has only been a short period of time since you advanced to a nine star Dou Huang. Hence, even if you enter the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, it would be quite difficult for you if you intend to rely on it to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He also felt some doubt within his heart. He valued this Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. Otherwise, he would not have taken the risk of being captured by the Wind Lightning Pavilion to head over to this place.</p>
 <p>“What method does elder Jin Shi have in mind?” Xiao Yan’s finger gently tapped on the rock table. He suppressed the earlier turbulence in his heart as he softly inquired.</p>
 <p>“The mouth of the Heaven Eye Mountain peak volcano is the place with the densest energy within the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. The Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is also formed from this enormous amount of energy. However, this is not the most exquisite part of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool.” Jin Shi’s eyes were thrown toward the enormous volcano mouth as he said in a deep voice, “Although most of the energy will agglomerate in the red-colored liquid in that enormous volcano mouth each time an energy tide is formed, a small portion of it will sink down and seep into the deepest portion of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. Although it contains only a small amount of energy, it is exceptionally pure, perhaps because it is formed over a long period of time… unfortunately, that place, which possesses a great treasure, is also where the fire poison is the densest.”</p>
 <p>The bitterness in Jin Shi’s face had become quite a lot denser when his words reached the end.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison within elder Jin Shi was obtained from that place?” Xiao Yan’s expression gradually changed as he asked.</p>
 <p>Jin Shi sighed and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Even with elder Jin Shi’s strength, you were unable to withstand the corrosion of the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison. Xiao Yan has only the strength of a nine star Dou Huang. How will I be able to endure it?” Xiao Yan involuntarily frowned as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Other people will naturally not dare to enter the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. However, for you, who possesses a ‘Heavenly Flame,’ it will not be too difficult. Although the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison is like maggots in one’s bones, it will still have no way of dealing with a ‘Heavenly Flame’.” Jin Shi smiled as he replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyebrows were involuntarily lifted when he heard this. Ever since he had entered the Heaven Eye Mountain, he had never revealed the ‘Heavenly Flame.’ How did this Jin Shi know that he possessed one?</p>
 <p>“The noses of our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe are extremely sharp. We also have an ability that can sense the energy within one’s body. It is not the first time that I have seen a ‘Heavenly Flame,’ and it is only natural that I am aware of the frightening scent of this thing.” Jin Shi grinned as he replied, aware of the doubt in Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan came to a sudden understanding as he said, “Does elder Jin intend on getting me to head to the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool and borrow the energy there to break through the Dou Huang class?”</p>
 <p>Jin Shi slightly tilted his head. He glanced at Xiao Yan and said, “That place is an area originally discovered by us, the Gold Swallowing Mouse. In order to open up that place, quite a number of Gold Swallowing Mice have ended up dying. Hence, that place can be considered a secret location to our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe. Even Feng Qing Er and the others are not aware of it. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan crossed his ten fingers. He mused for a moment. Only then did he raise his eyes and look at Jin Shi. He said, “Alright, but I will only help elder expel the poison after I successfully come out from the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool.”</p>
 <p>Jin Shi narrowed his eyes and slowly said, “It is not that I do not trust you. However, there is no evidence in a verbal agreement. I cannot just rely on a sentence of yours to confirm that you can really help me expel the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison from my body, can I?”</p>
 <p>“This is the Heaven Eye Mountain, the territory of the Gold Swallowing Mice. With elders Jin Gu and Jin Shi present in this place, you will not need to worry about the little me fleeing, do you?” Xiao Yan chuckled.</p>
 <p>Jin Shi turned his head slightly upon hearing this. He exchanged looks with Jin Gu. It was a long while later before he finally nodded. He faintly said, “In that case, I will trust you once. Hopefully, you will do as you promised. If you fail to meet the requirements of this transaction at that time, you should not blame the old me…”</p>
 <p>There was a faint threat at the end of his words. However, Xiao Yan merely grinned. Although the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison in Jin Shi’s body was serious, it was not completely impossible to expel it…</p>
 <p>Jin Shi waved his hand when he saw that Xiao Yan did not object. A gold light flashed to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“There is a spatial barrier that is placed by my Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe at the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. You must rely on this thing in order to enter it.” Jin Shi said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grabbed the object and glanced at it. It was a dark-golden-colored mouse skull. Xiao Yan nodded, stored it in his storage ring and laughed, “In that case, I will thank elder Jin Shi. If I am really able to breakthrough the Dou Huang class in this place, you can leave the treatment of the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison in your body to me.”</p>
 <p>“This is the best… you should return first. The peak of the energy tide will be arriving soon. At that time, the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool will swiftly fill up. All you need to do is enter it at the most opportune time.” Jin Shi said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also beamed when he heard this. He stood up and cupped his hands to the two before turning around, walking out of the rock pavilion. He headed toward the volcano’s mouth.</p>
 <p>Jin Shi involuntarily sighed when he saw Xiao Yan’s distant back. He said, “The bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is a place that our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe had discovered with much difficulty. If that place did not possess fire poison, it would have allowed our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe’s strength to soar. Unfortunately, an outsider will be the first who will enjoy its benefits.”</p>
 <p>“Stop nagging. Even with your strength, you have also been injured by the Blood Pool, leaving you like this. It is likely that the other tribe members will die on the spot if they head down. Although it is a treasure ground, it is also a fatal place.” Jin Gu curled his mouth as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Although I ended up getting the fire poison all over my body, I advanced from a five star Dou Zong to a seven star Dou Zong within these short ten years. This speed is many times faster than in other places. I can be considered to have not lost out.” Jin Shi smiled as he replied.</p>
 <p>“If you didn’t meet Xiao Yan, it is likely that you would not have lived for three more years. Even if we are able to invite a tier 7 alchemist from the Central Plains over, it is likely that the price will be even higher than if we hire him…”</p>
 <p>Jin Shi smiled. He also stood up and his gaze turned to the volcano’s mouth. He said, “Originally, I was thinking of using the blood pool to groom the experts in my tribe. However, from the looks of it now, I will need to plan carefully…”</p>
 <p>Jin Shi sighed after saying those words. His sigh contained a little unwillingness. Guarding a treasure that they could not use. Such a feeling was the thing that really caused one to become miserable.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Eight figures were standing on a slope near the mouth of the volcano. An argument was occurring.</p>
 <p>“All of you should stop arguing. There are only eight spots, yet there are nine of us here. I say that we should just allocate the spots based on the level of our strength. The one who is weakest should voluntarily withdraw. What do you say?” A white-clothed man, who had an evil appearance between his brow, swept his gaze over everyone before it finally landed on Nalan Yanran. He laughed.</p>
 <p>The expressions of the other people changed upon hearing his words. However, they did not open their mouths. Being the person in question, Nalan Yanran bunched up her eyebrows. Her hand rubbed the white fox in her embrace as she replied in a calm voice, “It is quite difficult for me to reach this place with my strength. However, since he has brought me here with much difficulty, it is naturally impossible for me to take the initiative to quit. Xiao Yan can get me to quit, but you cannot.”</p>
 <p>“All you did is borrow the strength of others. What ability do you have? Being someone else’s exclusive property and allowing others to play with you just for the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is not worthwhile.” The white-clothed man coldly laughed.</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er, Mu Qing Luan, and the two others did not join the present argument. With their strength, no one would dare point their eyes toward them. Hence, their gazes were all thrown to the mouth of the volcano.</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran’s pretty face turned frosty when she heard the mean words from the white-clothed man. Powerful Dou Qi swiftly surged out of her body. After which, fire seemed to rise from her pretty eyes as she stared at the former. Before she could attack, however, a hand gently landed on her shoulders. A laugh that caused her to relax was transmitted over.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the discussion is not going smoothly?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this voice, even Feng Qing Er and the three others swiftly turned their eyes over. They stared at Xiao Yan behind Nalan Yanran and their eyes contained unusual emotions.</p>
 <p>“Allow me.” Xiao Yan smiled slightly to Nalan Yanran. After which, he slowly stepped forward, staring at the white-clothed man. An iciness was revealed in the smile on his face, “Do you think that it is better for her to withdraw?”</p>
 <p>The expression of the white-clothed man became somewhat ugly when he saw Xiao Yan appear. However, he could not back down in front of everyone’s eyes. All he could do was toughen his skin and coldly laugh, “Originally, she would not have gotten here if she had relied on her own strength. Should she not give up this spot?”</p>
 <p>“Is there anyone else who thinks this?” Xiao Yan turned his head. His gaze slowly swept over everyone as he softly inquired.</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er and the others did not say anything in the face of Xiao Yan’s eyes, which revealed dangerous aura. The remaining two did not dare to clash with Xiao Yan. Hence, no one ended up speaking.</p>
 <p>“There are only eight spots, but there are nine of us here!” The corner of the white-clothed man’s mouth was pulled when he saw this before he finally cried out.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan tilted his head in agreement. He strode forward and the muffled sound of thunder appeared. An afterimage surfaced and his body emerged in front of the white-clothed man in a ghost-like manner.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed man had remained cautious while talking with Xiao Yan. Hence, his expression abruptly changed when the thunder sound appeared. His body swiftly withdrew, but he had just taken a step back when a figure followed close behind him like maggots in his bones. A thunder-like punch tore through the air and violently smashed into the chest of the white-clothed man.</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>A mouthful of crimson blood was spat out as the white-clothed man’s body flew backwards. It immediately collided with an enormous rock, that shattered into pieces!</p>
 <p>“Now, there are only eight people left…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure appeared. His looked at the collapsed man with indifferent eyes as he slowly spoke.</p>
