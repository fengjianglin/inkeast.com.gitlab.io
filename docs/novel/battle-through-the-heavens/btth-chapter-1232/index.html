 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1232: Awakening</u></strong></p>
 <p>The enormous dragon lingered over the sky. Its vast and mighty dragon might spread over this entire place. Under this intense dragon pressure, even the expressions of some Falling Star Pavilion Elders changed slightly. The figures that were suspended in the sky could not help but descend significantly.</p>
 <p>“Is this the senior training within the stone tower?”</p>
 <p>“What terrifying strength… this kind of aura. None of the Elders within the Pavilion could compare with him!</p>
 <p>“This aura should have reached the Dou Zun class. Hiss… how unbelievable. This senior is around the same age as us. Yet, he has unexpectedly reach this stage.”</p>
 <p>Waves after waves of private conversations sounded on the mountain after sensing the vast and mighty aura that permeated over the sky. One could still hear a shocked note in these voices. Clearly, it was the first time that they had met such a young elite Dou Zun. These people were in possession of quite a great talent in order to become the disciples of the Falling Star Pavilion. Their bones possessed some pride. However, such pride appeared to be worthless in front of this senior named Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>“This fellow… he’s really a little too frightening. He had actually directly broke through to the Dou Zun class.”</p>
 <p>The shock on Mu Qing Luan’s face continued for a moment before she gradually recovered her calmness. A bitter laughter was emitted. Her heart was also quite complicated. When she had first met Xiao Yan, the latter’s level was a little lower than hers. However, within a short two to three years, the latter adopted a terrifying soaring pace and directly advanced to the Dou Zun class. This caused her to feel some doubt about her training talent for the first time. How could she be considered a genius in the face of such an abnormal existence?</p>
 <p>“It is indeed Xiao Yan!”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe and Yao Lao stood in the empty air in the sky. Their eyes were fiery hot as they looked at the human figure on the head of the enormous dragon. The former involuntarily cried out joyfully as he did so.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao smiled and nodded. An excitement also flashed through his eyes. One year. This little fellow had finally awakened. Moreover, it seemed that his awakening this time around had brought him quite a great benefit.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, little fellow is indeed quite blessed. Not only has he truly activated the medicinal strength of the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill but he had even taken the opportunity to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class. If I guess correctly, he should have accumulated energy during this year and prepared to breakthrough in one attempt.” Feng zun-zhe laughed.</p>
 <p>“Yes. The amount of energy needed to breakthrough to the Dou Zun class is too great. If it is not because he had the help of the space meteorite, it is likely that this fellow’s breakthrough will be delayed by at least two years.” Yao Lao smiled. His face contained a pleased expression. Xiao Yan was usually good at grasping opportunities. Currently, he did not give up this great opportunity, choosing to be silent for a year to do so. Finally, at this very moment, he had completely erupted in a shocking manner.</p>
 <p>While everyone were sighing in surprise within their hearts, the meandering large dragon in the sky continued to remain for over ten minutes before gradually disappearing. With the scattering of the large dragon, the dragon’s might that permeated the place also swiftly weakened.</p>
 <p>With the complete disappearance of the enormous dragon, that figure in the sky also gradually become clear. At the end, it finally completely appeared in front of everyone’s sight.</p>
 <p>The young human figure in the sky stretched his lazy waist. The skin on his body immediately wiggled at this moment. Those bones in his body emitted numerous bone cracking and rubbing sound, which appeared just like the starting of a complicated mechanical equipment.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan sensed the comfortable feeling that spread within his body, a breath of somewhat hot air followed his throat before being spat out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Is this the strength of an elite Dou Zun…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his hand slightly. He sensed the vast ocean like Dou Qi within his body and involuntarily became absent minded. This kind of strength possessed an allure that could cause one to become crazy, Countless number of people had spent all their life trying to obtain such strength.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stretched his hand before suddenly clenching it. The space in front of him was actually suddenly distorted into a strange depression. If this clenching occurred on a person’s body, even an expert Dou Zong’s body would end up crumbling into a pile of blood and flesh.</p>
 <p>A smile slowly surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face as he sensed this vast and mighty strength that could distort space by just raising one’s hand. This stage was so distant and unreachable when he looked at it back then. Now, however, he had truly reached it…</p>
 <p>If the current Xiao Yan was to meet old ghost Zhai Xing again, he might not dare to say that he could kill the latter without unleashing the Annihilation Lotus Flame but with his strength, that old ghost Zhai Xing would not be able to do anything to him.</p>
 <p>This was the gap between a Dou Zun and a Dou Zong. When Xiao Yan was at the nine star Dou Zong, he only had the choice to flee when meeting an expert like old ghost Zhai Xing. Even if he unleashed the Annihilation Lotus Flame, he would at the very most be able to fight until the both of them were seriously injured. However, once he broke through the Dou Zong class and entered the level of a Dou Zun, everything would undergo a drastic change.</p>
 <p>The current Xiao Yan might not be able to defeat old ghost Zhai Xing in an ordinary battle. Similarly, however, he would no longer need much effort to escape from the hands of old ghost Zhai Xing.</p>
 <p>“Old ghost Zhai Xing… this debt, there will be a time when you have to repay.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s dark black eyes, which had been quiet for a long time, had a faint chillness flashing over it. He must not easily let this old ghost off even if he ended up benefiting from this disaster of being seriously injured.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>A rushing wind sound was swiftly transmitted over while a desire to kill surged within Xiao Yan’s heart. Immediately, a couple of figures flashed and appeared beside Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“You are finally willing to wake up…”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe patted heavily on Xiao Yan’s shoulders. During this one year’s time, they had been miserably tortured because of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, thank you old Feng.” Xiao Yan smiled and respectfully cupped his hands together towards Feng zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>“You should thank your teacher. He has likely not have many good sleeps during this one year.” Feng zun-zhe waved his hand and said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes turned towards the smiling Yao Lao by the side when he heard this. He looked at the familiar smile that he had not seen for many years and something surged in his heart. For an instant, he was actually unaware of just what he ought to say.</p>
 <p>“Don’t listen to this fellow’s nonsense. It’s good that you have awaken. It’s good that you have awaken…”</p>
 <p>Even with Yao Lao’s calmness, his heart involuntarily became emotional as he spoke when he watched the face that appeared much more matured compared to back then.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were a little red as he looked at the laughing Yao Lao. All of his ability were taught by Yao Lao with great effort. If it was not because of Yao Lao, Xiao Yan at the very most become just an expert within the Jia Ma Empire even if his training talent did not disappear. This continent had never lacked any geniuses. It did not matter if he was included or not.</p>
 <p>It was because of the experience in his youth that had honed Xiao Yan’s character. Hence, Yao Lao was an important part that could not be missing for him to be able to possess his achievements today.</p>
 <p>However, despite Yao Lao putting in a great amount of effort to groom him, he could only merely watch Yao Lao being captured by the Hall of Soul back then without being able to do anything. This kind of helpless feeling was the most torturing form of torture.</p>
 <p>“Alright, little fellow, there is no need to think about the matters of the past. The speed of your growth has exceeded my expectations. Looks like the Hall of Soul’s act of capturing me had ended up helping you…” Yao Lao softly patted Xiao Yan and laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he heard this. Although these words were somewhat of a joke, there was indeed some truth to it. Ever since Yao Lao was captured by the Hall of Soul, the motivation for Xiao Yan to train had become incomparably strong. It was also because of this kind of training motivation that enabled Xiao Yan’s strength to soar within a short couple of years…</p>
 <p>“Teacher, I have currently already swallowed three types of Heavenly Flames and already possessed sufficient ability to help you refine a body…” Xiao Yan swiftly settled down the emotions within his heart. He glanced at Yao Lao’s somewhat illusory body before speaking anxiously.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s heart was filled with a warm and pleased feeling when he saw the anxious desire on Xiao Yan’s face. The Heavens had caused him to be blind once. Fortunately, she did not allow him to be blind a second time…</p>
 <p>“The matter of refining a body is not urgent. Although Yao Chen’s life was not in danger when he fell into the hands of the Hall of Soul this time around, he had lost quite a lot of essence spiritual Qi. Before refining a body, we must first replenish the lost essence spiritual Qi. Otherwise, even if he obtained a physical body, his strength will not advance.” Feng zun-zhe by the side shook his head and said upon hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Essence spiritual Qi?” Xiao Yan was startled.</p>
 <p>“There is another term for the essence spiritual Qi. It is also called essence Spiritual Strength. The Hall of Soul had captured those spirits because they wish to remove these essence spiritual Qi from their bodies. This kind of spiritual Qi is the life of a soul. Once the spiritual Qi is lost, it would end up causing a great harm to the soul.” Feng zun-zhe explained.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression immediately sunk upon hearing this. He recalled those chains that lingered over all the souls. This thing was actually used to absorb the spiritual Qi.</p>
 <p>“How can we replenish the spiritual Qi?” Xiao Yan asked. Currently, everything was already prepared. He must fulfill Yao Lao’s only wish at all cost.</p>
 <p>“The spiritual Qi is the foundation of a soul. It is extremely difficult to be altered by external force.” Feng zun-zhe mused for a moment and replied. “However, there are two unique things in this world that possess the mysterious effect of repairing spiritual Qi.”</p>
 <p>“Which two?” Xiao Yan swiftly inquired.</p>
 <p>“The Soul Baby Fruit and the Spiritual Dragon Heavenly Fungus.” Feng zun-zhe slowly replied. “As long as we can obtain one of these two, we will be able to replenish the spiritual Qi that Yao Chen had lost. Unfortunately, the rarity of these two types of mysterious items are superior in every way when compared to the Heavenly Flames. I have only read about them on some ancient books.”</p>
 <p>“During this one year that you have been unconscious, I have already dispatched the experts from the Falling Star Pavilion to search for information on these two types of mysterious things. However…”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe shook his head and sighed softly when he spoke until this point.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart involuntarily sunk upon hearing this. It was unexpected that some unexpected incident had occurred now that they were already fully prepared.</p>
 <p>“This damn Hall of Soul.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gritted his teeth. If Yao Lao was unable to replenish the spiritual Qi, would that not mean that he will always be unable to possess a body?”</p>
 <p>“Is there really no other solutions?” Xiao Yan spoke somewhat unwillingly.</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe was silent.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s fist was involuntarily clenched tightly when he saw this matter of Feng zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>While the few of them were quiet, an Elder at the side hesitated for a moment before suddenly speaking softly.”</p>
 <p>“Pavilion chief Feng, the Soul Baby Fruit, one of the two mysterious items that you have mentioned… it is rumoured that it is in the ancient remains that had caused an uproar recently…”</p>
