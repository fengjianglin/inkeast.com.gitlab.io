 <p><strong><u>Chapter 468: Troublesome Matter</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood just outside the door after exiting the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.’ He lifted his head and eyed this mysterious black tower, where only the top of it was exposed. He was unable to resist letting out a long breath. For some unknown reason, he constantly felt that this black tower was not that simple…</p>
 <p>“Hu, it is really unexpected… it actually agglomerated a ‘Fire Spirit’ with emotions and intelligence. Tsk tsk. No wonder the Inner Academy is so strict. They even created a ‘Space Lock,’ which even an elite Dou Zun would have to use all his might in order to cast…” Just as Xiao Yan was sighing, Yao Lao’s surprised voice suddenly sounded in his heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled when he heard Yao Lao’s words. His expression did not change as he looked all around him. After which, he waved his hand toward Wu Hao, who still appeared slightly giddy. After which, he turned his body and walked on the path which they had used to travel here earlier.</p>
 <p>“What is the ‘Fire Spirit’ that teacher just mentioned?” Xiao Yan walked at a steady pace, that was neither fast nor slow, along this road lined with trees. Only then did he inquire about this in his heart.</p>
 <p>“An alternate life form that is created from pure flames… that invisible flame serpent that you saw earlier should be the intelligence that was created from within the ‘Fallen Heart Flame.’ It can even be said that the fire python is the original body of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ within this ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower!’” Yao Lao slowly explained.</p>
 <p>“What? That fire python is the ‘Fallen Heart Flame?’” Xiao Yan’s footsteps suddenly paused. His expression involuntarily changed a little as he could not help but let out a startled cry.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I should not have sensed wrongly… Those strange flames between the Heavens and Earth would grow into various different unique forms after being accumulated over time. An example is the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ which you met in the lava underground. That plant form that is similar to a lotus is only formed after the core flame has undergone thousands of years of suppression…” Yao Lao said in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Of course, the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ which we found last time may possess a plant form but it had not formed an emotion or intelligence that belonged to it. However, earlier… I truly felt that fire python. This kind of flame body, which possesses intelligence that belongs to itself, is what we call a ‘Fire Spirit.’ Its intelligence should be comparable with some ultimate Magical Beasts that can possess a human form.”</p>
 <p>“Then… how do we refine this kind of ‘Fire Spirit’ even if we obtain it? Earlier, I also sensed the frightening aura of that thing. I’m afraid that even a strong Dou Huang might not be its match. How can we swallow it?” Yao Lao’s words caused Xiao Yan to feel shocked. He did not expect that even a flame was able to form its own consciousness. However, now that this flame already had its own consciousness, it would definitely not be willing to be swallowed and refined by other people. Seeing the frightening aura that it displayed earlier, Xiao Yan immediately became dispirited.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed very difficult… however there is no other choice. Of course, it does not matter if you are willing to give up this ‘Fallen Heart Flame,’ and go and search for other ‘Heavenly Flames.’” Yao Lao laughed faintly.</p>
 <p>“What joke are you cracking… are ‘Heavenly Flames’ so easy to find?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan immediately cried out within his heart when he heard this. After spending a couple of years, he had obtained the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ by relying solely on luck. Now that he had found the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ after much difficulty, how would he be willing to give it up?</p>
 <p>“In that case we can only wait and see… actually let’s not mention how we are going to handle it after we get the ‘Fallen Heart Flame.’ Just how do we obtain it is already filled with numerous problems.” Yao Lao’s voice contained a tone as if he had a headache, “The strong people in this Inner Academy are as numerous as the clouds. In the tower earlier, I could vaguely sense that there exists extremely faint but powerful auras a few levels below. The strength of these auras is such that in my current spiritual form, it is impossible for me to gain much advantage when fighting with them.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s knit his brows as his ten fingers were tightly hooked together.</p>
 <p>“Moreover, at this moment, I can confirm that the reason the Inner Academy is able to increase the training speed of the students is basically due to the existence of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’... They sealed the ‘Fallen Heart Flame,’ which had formed a spirit, into the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,’ borrowing its effect of letting the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ form a split body at the invocation of a person’s heart when he is close to it. This allows the students to use it to strengthen their Qi Paths and refine Dou Qi...</p>
 <p>“They… are… rearing the ‘Fallen Heart Flame!’” Yao Lao slowly exhaled a breath of cool air as he faintly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hands, which were held together, abruptly trembled. He wiped the cold sweat on his forehead without leaving a trace. In his heart, he continued to feel shock at these crazy and bold actions of the Inner Academy. These fellows were really too frightening. They actually had the courage to try to tame a thing that had the greatest destructive forces between the Heavens and Earth.</p>
 <p>Only after Yao Lao’s explanation did Xiao Yan understand that the Inner Academy had reared the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ like one would rear a dairy cow. After which, they repeatedly obtained an unending amount of ‘milk’ from it; the split bodies of ‘Fallen Heart Flame’... this kind of action could indeed be called insane.</p>
 <p>“An expert is indeed bold. This Inner Academy is really frightening…” Xiao Yan swallowed a mouthful of saliva and muttered in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, bold? I think they are playing with fire and will end up getting burned.” Yao Lao coldly snorted.</p>
 <p>“Why? From what I saw, there seems to be no problem?” Xiao Yan said in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Hei, currently, they are relying on the lock of the ‘Space Cage’, so there is indeed no problem. However, this is merely an expedient measure. By relying on that ‘Space Cage,’ it is impossible to continue keeping the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ sealed within the tower.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao laughed, “A fire can be scattered, but cannot be blocked. This ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ is a unique flame that is formed from the Heavens and the Earth. It possesses true destructive strength… by sealing and blocking it in this manner, it is like the Inner Academy is building a barrier on the mouth of a volcano. Have you seen anyone who can block a volcano? Its current oppressed manner is merely because it is storing strength. At the time when it erupts, this ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ will immediately be destroyed!”</p>
 <p>“Even though the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ is frightening, those old fellows from the Inner Academy are also not some useless lot. Before the eruption, one will charge and one will block. Both parties will have some losses. At that time, it might perhaps be our chance…”</p>
 <p>“Teacher, you mean that we should wait for the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ to erupt by itself?” Xiao Yan was startled as he said in a stunned manner.</p>
 <p>“Ah, we can only do this. We are small in number and weak in strength. There is no use if we openly do it…” Yao Lao nodded and replied.</p>
 <p>“Then when do we need to wait until?” Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and laughed bitterly.</p>
 <p>“Based on the counterattack of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ earlier, there might be a turn of events soon. At the very most, it will take two years and at the very least it will take one.” Yao Lao mused for a long while before he lowered his voice as he revealed information softly in Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s pupils swiftly flashed. A long while later, he carefully watched his surroundings. Other than Wu Hao, who was repeatedly knocked his giddy head, there was no other movement. The words Yao Lao had spoken concerned the matter of the life and death of the Inner Academy.</p>
 <p>“In the days that follow, you must make the most of the time and train in the tower. It would be best if you can raise your strength to the Dou Ling class in half a year’s time. At that time, with the inclusion of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Flame Splitting Tsunami,’ I think that you can run wild without fear within the Dou Ling class. If you use the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ that is formed from the combination of the Purple and the Green Flame, it is likely that even the Elder Su, from outside the forest back then, would not have the courage to receive it head on with one hand…”</p>
 <p>“It would be best that you try your best not to use the large-scale ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame’ that combines the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ and the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame.’ That thing may have a frightening strength, but its backlash is simply too great. At times, you will lose more than what you gain.”</p>
 <p>“Additionally, you should go and begin practicing that Di class Agility Dou Technique, ‘Three Thousand Lightning Movement.’ As long as you successfully practice that thing, you should be able to be in an unshakable position when you face ordinary Dou Lings. Even if you meet a strong Dou Wang, you should have the ability to flee even if you are unable to beat him. We must now agglomerate our strength in preperation for the eruption of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame.’”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s voice was like shooting a bullet. His great amount of words caused Xiao Yan to continue smiling bitterly. It was only a long while later before he completely disgested those words.</p>
 <p>“It seems that there are still the various ingredients for the ‘Ground Spirit Pill’ right?” After slowly swallowing all of the various reminders from Yao Lao, Xiao Yan mused for a moment only to realize that there was something that Yao Lao missed. Immediately, he spoke with a smile. This thing was also a necessary item. Otherwise, even if he were to obtain the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ in the future, it was likely that he would not dare to touch it.</p>
 <p>“Uh… indeed. However, those ingredients are all extremely rare items. You need to pay careful attention.” Yao Lao was startled before he immediately nodded and responded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and nodded. He raised his head and eyed the blue sky before he involuntarily exhaled. Were there not so many troublesome matters...</p>
 <p>“Why are you sighing? Is it because of the problems of ‘Pan Gate?’”</p>
 <p>A voice suddenly sounded behind him. Xiao Yan turned around and took a look. It was actually Wu Hao. The current him seemed to have recovered from his unconscious state after being grilled by the Heart Flame.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, it’s nothing.” Xiao Yan laughed softly before saying, “Let’s go. We should return and take a look first.” Once he said that, he took the lead to quicken his footsteps, and flew through the road that he had come from earlier. Wu Hao followed close behind.</p>
 <p>After nearly forty to fifty minutes, Xiao Yan and Wu Hao gradually moved closer to the residence area of the new students. As he slowly walked into the residence area, the empty road caused the two of them to be startled.</p>
 <p>Just as the both of them were somewhat stunned, a human figure suddenly came running out from within the residence area while panting. When he saw Xiao Yan and Wu Hao, joy immediately swarmed onto his face. He rolled and crawled as he rushed over while shouting, “Head, something happened!”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Xiao Yan hurriedly moved forward and asked when he heard the loud cry of this new student.</p>
 <p>“There is someone who wants to pull some new students away, but no one agreed in the end. As a result, those fellows wanted to create trouble. Now, they are forcing Senior Xun Er and Hu Jia to fight!”</p>
 <p>“Who has come?” Xiao Yan’s expression sunk. He hurriedly walked toward the interior. As he walked, he voiced his question.</p>
 <p>When he heard Xiao Yan’s question, that new student involuntarily became a little hesitant. This scene caused Xiao Yan’s footsteps to pause as he said in a deep voice, “Speak!”</p>
 <p>“The person leading them… is Bai Shan.” The new student could only reply with a bitter smile after he was reprimanded.</p>
 <p>“This bastard repays kindness by stabbing people in the back!”</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Xiao Yan and Wu Hao’s expression instantly became dark.</p>
