 <p><strong><u>Chapter 677: The Situation in the Jia Ma Empire</u></strong></p>
 <p>Being the host, Mu Tie arranged the seating arrangements for Xiao Yan and his group within a spacious hall in the city governor’s mansion before he returned to his own seat. At the same time, he ordered the female servants to serve tea appearing quite thoughtful.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, it is really unexpected that brother Xiao Yan’s strength has actually reached this level three years after we parted.” Mu Tie lifted his teacup and took a sip before he laughed. His gaze immediately swept over Xiao Li, Lin Yan, and the others who were beside Xiao Yan, without leaving a trace. He felt that his heart was somewhat jumpy. He clearly understood that the most frightening thing of Xiao Yan’s return this time around was not his extraordinary strong self but these strong people whom he had gathered from some unknown place. Anyone of these people who were seated here would likely be sufficient to contend with the ‘Ten Strong’ of the empire.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled but did not continue to be entangled with this topic. He mused for a moment before slowly speaking, “Big brother Mu Tie, it seems that the Jia Ma Empire isn’t very peaceful these few years…”</p>
 <p>Mu Tie laughed bitterly when he heard this. He sighed, “It is indeed not very peaceful. All of this tension is caused by the Misty Cloud Sect.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrows.</p>
 <p>Mu Tie drank a sip of tea and moistened his throat. He seemed to be sorting out his words. A moment later, he opened his mouth to speak, “Within less than half a month after you have left the Jia Ma Empire, the Misty Cloud Sect had changed its aloof style of the past. Not only did it recruit disciples in large numbers but it also showed traces of scattering its disciples to all of the key cities within the empire. It is likely that the imperial family and the three large clans had sensed these little actions of theirs. However, due to Yun Shan’s frightening strength, there was no one who dared say anything. After this, the Misty Cloud Sect has also become more and more arrogant…”</p>
 <p>Mu Tie’s gaze secretly looked at Xiao Yan after speaking until this point. He hesitated for a moment before speaking, “After that, the Misty Cloud Sect began the extermination of the Xiao clan… this matter caused an uproar within the empire back then but it did not pose any hindrance to the Misty Cloud Sect.”</p>
 <p>The hand which Xiao Yan used to hold the teacup tightened slightly. His dark-black eyes slowly became narrowed as a faint, cold glint flashed through them.</p>
 <p>Mu Tie was startled when he saw the calm manner of Xiao Yan. He immediately understood it. It was likely that this young man in front of him was already aware of this…</p>
 <p>“Does big brother Mu Tie know where the remnant members of our Xiao clan are?” Xiao Yan rubbed the teacup as he softly spoke.</p>
 <p>“I am also not too certain about this. Back then, any traces of the Xiao clan completely disappeared after the matter happened. However, if brother Xiao Yan wants to search for them, I will advise you to make a trip to the Primer clan. They might perhaps know something.” Mu Tie shook his head and immediately voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>“The Primer clan huh?” Xiao Yan nodded his head. It seemed that he must go and find Hai Bodong in order to learn the whereabouts of big brother and the others.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, currently the Primer clan is already completely in the control of Ya Fei xiao-jie. Tsk tsk, this woman may be young but that ability of hers is something that even our clan’s elders have quietly praised repeatedly. Within three short years, she has turned the Primer clan into the top of the three large clans. People have no choice but to submit to her.” Mu Tie smiled and explained some more.</p>
 <p>TL: xiao-jie - young lady of a powerful/rich clan</p>
 <p>“Big sister Ya Fei?” Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this name which was stored deep within his mind. A warm smile immediately surfaced on the corner of his mouth. It was all thanks to the Primer clan and her intervention back then when he was chased by the Misty Cloud Sect that he was able to gain the opportunity to flee. Her favor toward him was something that Xiao Yan would never forget.</p>
 <p>“It is really unexpected that she is able to control the Primer clan within her hands. I have somewhat underestimated her in the past.” Xiao Yan rubbed his nose and softly laughed. He clearly understood just how difficult it was for a woman, especially one who did not have extraordinary talent in terms of Dou Qi training, to control the people of an entire clan in this world that was ruled by Dou Qi.</p>
 <p>Mu Tie smiled. He appeared to randomly inquire, “Brother Xiao Yan’s return… it is likely that there is going to be quite a big activity, right?”</p>
 <p>“I am only opposing the Misty Cloud Sect.” Xiao Yan spoke with a faint smile. His gaze drifted toward Mu Tie as he suddenly said, “Does big brother Mu Tie has any information regarding Yun Shan?”</p>
 <p>Mu Tie was stunned when he heard this. He immediately shook his head in embarrassment as he said, “How can I understand an expert of that level? However, I am occasionally able to gather something from the rumors among the Elders in the clan. It is likely that the current Yun Shan is even stronger than he was three years ago.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was also helpless in the face of these basically useless words. His gaze looked at the tiny ripple spreading within his cup. A noble, graceful, beautiful face suddenly flashed and appeared in his mind. The various angry smiles between his forehead caused Xiao Yan’s mood to suddenly become chaotic.</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>A slight crack line formed on the teacup in his hand because of the great strength he emitted. Everyone in the hall had stunned faces as they looked at Xiao Yan, whose aura had started to rise. All of them were confused.</p>
 <p>“Third brother, what is it?” Xiao Li, who was seated closest to Xiao Yan hurriedly touched Xiao Yan and asked.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” Xiao Yan gradually recovered after being touched by Xiao Li. He inhaled a deep breath of air and suppressed his chaotic heart. He waved his hand and carelessly inquired, “... that’s right, big brother Mu Tie, do you know who is currently in control of the Misty Cloud Sect?”</p>
 <p>“Who else can it be. Naturally, it’s Yun Shan.” Mu Tie spread his hands and said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan raised his eyebrows and rolled his tongue a couple of times. Finally, he uttered a name he had resisted for three years, “What about Yun Yun? It seems that she is the leader of the Misty Cloud Sect right?”</p>
 <p>“Sect leader Yun Yun huh… Yun Shan stripped her of her position of sect leader not long after you left the Jia Ma Empire. After which, she no longer managed the issues within the sect. Currently, all the authority within the Misty Cloud Sect is managed by Yun Shan.” Mu Tie voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded his head after hearing this. Somewhere deep within his heart, he sighed in relief without realizing it.</p>
 <p>“These current actions of the Misty Cloud Sect can be mostly credited to Yun Shan. Moreover, by looking at what happened in the ‘Zhen Gui Pass’ this time, it is likely that the Misty Cloud Sect will begin to have some large activity during this period of time.” Mu Tie slowly said, “If the matter here were to spread to the capital, it is likely that there may be an uproar even in the imperial family. Looking at all of this activity, it seem that the situation that was written in a letter the Elders in the clan had given me is true.”</p>
 <p>“What situation?” Xiao Yan was startled as he asked.</p>
 <p>Mu Tie face was tensed. He placed his teacup on the table. It was a moment later before he spoke in the deep voice, “It is likely that the Misty Cloud Sect wishes to attack our three large clans…”</p>
 <p>Xao Yan knit his brows. Did the Misty Cloud Sect really intend to eliminate all the factions within the Jia Ma Empire?</p>
 <p>“Of course, it is currently uncertain whether they will attack our Mu clan and the Nalan clan. However, there is one thing that is certain. The Misty Cloud Sect will definitely start off with the Primer clan within a short period of time!” Mu Tie spoke was a solemn expression.</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, brother Xiao Yan should know something about this. The old man Hai Bodong of the Primer clan has quite a deep relationship with you. Back then, the Primer clan even quietly aided you when you were chased by the Misty Cloud Sect. The Primer clan also intervened when the Xiao clan was surrounded by the Misty Cloud Sect. It was only because of this that the Xiao clan was not completely eliminated. Although the Primer clan acted in extreme secret when they made all their moves, it is likely that the Misty Cloud Sect is aware of them if even I am able to catch wind of something…”</p>
 <p>“Moreover, for some unknown reason, the Misty Cloud Sect seems to be extremely interested in your Xiao clan and have been repeatedly searching desperately for the remaining members of the Xiao clan. However, their efforts have been futile. From the looks of it now, this should be because of the secret tactics by the Primer clan… hence, if they want to find the remnant members of the Xiao clan, the Primer clan, which is their protector, would definitely be a target of the Misty Cloud Sect.” Mu Tie smiled, fondled his chin, and responded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. From the looks of the situation, he needed to hurry to the capital as soon as possible. Otherwise, not only would the Primer clan end up in the same trouble as the Xiao clan but the odds would also be against those remaining members of the Xiao clan who were under their protection.</p>
 <p>“Currently, the capital should be in a turbulent storm. That place is far too close to the Misty Cloud Sect. The place would definitely be extremely chaotic should anything erupt there.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother Mu Tie, I hope that you will keep my return to the Jia Ma Empire a secret. Moreover, you should tell those subordinates of yours not to leak any information. Otherwise, should it end up spreading to the ears of the Misty Cloud Sect, it is very likely that they will bring forward their plans and increase their defenses.” Xiao Yan stood up from the chair, turned his head to Mu Tie, and spoke in a solemn voice.</p>
 <p>“Aye. No problem.” Mu Tie nodded without hesitation. He said, “For insurance, I will delay reporting what happened at the border to the imperial family for a couple of days. Otherwise, they will definitely learn of your return.”</p>
 <p>“In that case, thank you very much.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Brother Xiao Yan, you… are you planning to head to the capital?” Mu Tie hurriedly stood up and asked when he saw Xiao Yan doing the same.</p>
 <p>“We are pressed for time. I cannot stay here for long. I will come and chat with big brother Mu Tie once everything is settled.” Xiao Yan smiled, nodded, and gave his reply.</p>
 <p>Mu Tie could not open his mouth to retain them when he heard this. He could only nod his head and personally send Xiao Yan and the others out of the hall.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan and the others flashed upon leaving the hall as they rushed to the Tiger Eagle Beast, which had remained in the air. Xiao Yan stood on its enormous head and cupped his hands toward Mu Tie below. He spoke with a loud and clear voice, “Big brother Mu Tie, you can just come and find Xiao Yan if you have any problems in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, brother Xiao Yan, take care of yourself on your trip to the capital. If possible, help take care our my Mu clan. Mu Tie will be ever grateful!” Mu Tie laughed as he spoke sincerely to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He waved his hand and the Tiger Eagle Beast let out a low roar. Immediately, it carried a wild wind as it swiftly rose higher into the air and eventually transformed into a black spot that disappeared on the horizon…</p>
 <p>Mu Tie sighed softly as he watched Xiao Yan and the others disappeared into the horizon. He knew that the already turbulent capital might well be turned completely upside down with the arrival of Xiao Yan’s group...</p>
