 <p><strong><u>Chapter 140: Obtaining the Amethyst Essence</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Rank three?”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan wiped the cold sweat off his face. Even with the Dou Qi that Yun Zhi had left in his body, he would not be able to finish off this young Amethyst Winged Lion with its abnormal defense.</p>
 <p>Tightly pressing his eyebrows together, Xiao Yan stared at the young Amethyst Winged Lion lying on the ground. After worrying for a moment, he turned his gaze towards Yao Lao and probed, “Why doesn’t Teacher kill that little thing?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve said before that once you enter the Magic Beast Mountain Range, you will have to rely on yourself. Unless it comes to a life or death situation, I will not help you.” Yao Lao smiled as he gently swayed above Xiao Yan’ head.</p>
 <p>“Damn, you are heartless!” Xiao Yan’s eyelids twitched as he pointed his middle finger at Yao Lao before helplessly mumbling, “I don’t believe that I cannot get rid of it.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t really intend to directly try to finish it off, do you? That guy may not appear very large, but when it comes to combat strength, it is one of the strongest amongst the rank three Magic Beasts. With your little body, even if you used the Di Rank Dou Technique, you would still be hard pressed to kill it.” Yao Lao said, a warning tone in his voice.</p>
 <p>“I would only take him head on if I was an idiot.” Xiao Yan leaned against a rock wall and sat down. From his storage ring, he took out a large number of things and began flipping through them. Finally, he took out a pale purple fruit and a bottle of green liquid.</p>
 <p>“Purple Smoke Fruit?” Seeing the pale purple fruit in Xiao Yan’s hand, Yao Lao softly said, “Ha, you seemed to be quite well adapted to actually recall that a fire type Magic Beast loves this thing.”</p>
 <p>The Purple Smoke Fruit was a special fruit that could be found in the Magic Beast Mountain Range. As this fruit contained a little fire energy in it, it was well loved by many kinds of fire type Magic Beasts.</p>
 <p>Ignoring Yao Lao, Xiao Yan once again removed a hollow tube with a crystal needle and stuck it in the bottle of green colored liquid. Afterwards, he extracted some of the green liquid and carefully injected it into the fruit. With a light squeeze, the green coloured liquid was poured into the fruit.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you are thinking of using poison? That Amethyst Winged Lion has quite a strong immunity. With the poisons that you have created, do you think you can cause it to collapse?” Seeing Xiao Yan’s action, Yao Lao could not help but ask with a suspicious tone.</p>
 <p>“Who said that this was poison?” Xiao Yan licked his mouth and chillingly laughed, “This is a strong laxative that I created. As long as it eats it, I am certain that it will have to go the bathroom non-stop regardless of how strong its immunity is.”</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk. To think you still have this up your sleeve. But you should not underestimate the intelligence of a rank three Magic Beast. It may not be as smart as the one outside but its intelligence is something that cannot be compared with a rank one or two Magic Beast. It would not eat things of unknown origins.” Yao Lao gave Xiao Yan a thumbs up before speaking.</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t eat it? Ha ha. That isn’t up to him. Regardless of how one puts it, a beast is a beast.” Xiao Yan grinned and took out another bottle of red colored liquid from his storage ring. When he opened it, a great fragrance that caused one’s stomach to rumble came floating out.</p>
 <p>Just as the smell began to spread, Xiao Yan hurriedly replaced the cap and sneakily said, “This is the liquid from an Anorexia Flower. As long as it is inserted into the Purple Smoke Fruit, I don’t believe that that little beast would be able to resist the allure of delicacy.”</p>
 <p>Watching Xiao Yan repeatedly taking things from his storage ring, Yao Lao was somewhat speechless. Xiao Yan’s interesting choices in refining medicine were both funny and annoying. His body slightly drifted and asked again, “Even if it ate the fruit, your plan would fail if it clears its bowels here.”</p>
 <p>“I have taken a look inside and did not find any dirty Magic Beast feces. Additionally, I did not find it anywhere else along the way here. I think that the Amethyst Winged Lions has a habit of cleanliness. A Magic Beast that is actually particular about cleanliness? How strange… also, please stop asking questions. This plan is just an impromptu thought, so how can it be perfect? It is difficult to say whether or not it will work.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Xiao Yan ignored Yao Lao’s questions as he transferred about seven or eight tubes of the green colored liquid before adding the Anorexia Flower juice. Only then did he stop. He tossed the heavy fruit in his hand and smiled. Once he returned everything to his storage ring, he gently placed the Purple Smoke Fruit at the entrance to the cave.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan placed the fruit properly and jumped off the ground; his body shooting towards the ceiling of the tunnel. Using an intense suction force on both hands, he firmly nailed his body to the rock wall.</p>
 <p>Almost immediately after the Purple Smoke Fruit was placed at the cave entrance, a fragrant scent was slowly emitted. With the help of the wind, this scent began spreading into the cave.</p>
 <p>The small Amethyst Winged Lion’s nose twitched as it sucked deeply in.</p>
 <p>When the first whiff entered its stomach, a deep noise sounded from the young Amethyst Winged Lion’s stomach. It slowly opened its beast eyes and shook its large head around the spacious cave, searching for the source of the fragrance.</p>
 <p>After the search went on for a moment, the young Amethyst Winged Lion finally found the target. It lazily stood up and let out a low roar from its huge mouth before it opened its steps and strolled towards the cave entrance.</p>
 <p>Arriving at the cave entrance, the young Amethyst Winged Lion’s nose sniffed at the Purple Smoke Fruit. Instantly, it lifted its head and swept an alert gaze across its surroundings. It then extended its large paw and gently touched the Purple Smoke Fruit. A short silence later, it waved its tail, turned around and left.</p>
 <p>Through a small crack, Xiao Yan watched the young Amethyst Winged Lion turn around to leave and could not help but sigh in disappointment. It seemed like the alertness of this little thing was higher than what he had thought.</p>
 <p>Just as Xiao Yan was planning of thinking of another plan, the young Amethyst Winged Lion which had walked for around half the distance to the spot it had rested suddenly turned around again. It dashed to where the Purple Smoke Fruit was, extended its tongue and swallowed it.</p>
 <p>Seeing its action, Xiao Yan finally heaved a long sigh of relief. He whispered, “Dammit. Even I almost ended up eating it. I knew you would eat it.”</p>
 <p>After eating the Purple Smoke Fruit, the young Amethyst Winged Lion once again laid down on the beautiful ground made of amethyst stone. A moment later, it suddenly stood up as its stomach made a muffled rumbling noise. It swept its gaze around the interior and under the relieved gaze of Xiao Yan, finally dashed towards the cave entrance and out of the tunnel at an extreme speed.</p>
 <p>“It succeeded!” Seeing the young Amethyst Winged Lion disappear, Xiao Yan could not resist letting out a joyful cry. He leapt down from the ceiling and seizing every minute, hurried into the cave interior that was covered with amethyst stones.</p>
 <p>Standing in the interior of the cave, Xiao Yan took out the crystal that was beginning to turn hot. He held it in his hand and using its temperature as a direction indicator, slowly moved in the cave filled with amethyst rocks.</p>
 <p>After moving around the cave for a long while, Xiao Yan’s footsteps finally came to a stop at the spot where the young Amethyst Winged Lion had rested. He slightly lowered his body and extended his hand, lightly knocking on the tens of amethyst stones near him.</p>
 <p>When his finger knocked on an amethyst stone that was leaning on one side, it instantly emitted a hollow sound.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was slightly surprised when he heard the sound. With great speed, he groped and pulled the slate. A purple light burst out, forcing Xiao Yan to hurriedly closed his eyes as the light pierced his eyes.</p>
 <p>After waiting for the pain in his eyes to subside, Xiao Yan once again gradually opened them. His gaze swept onto the small hole. In it was a fist size purple colored spirit stone that was oddly sharp. A bright light flowed on top of the purple colored spirit stone, giving it a beautiful appearance.</p>
 <p>Upon the appearance of this sharp purple colored spirit stone, the crystal in Xiao Yan’s hand grew as hot as fire. Immediately, Xiao Yan hurriedly stored the crystal into the ring and carefully took the purple colored spirit stone from within the small hole and also stored it into the storage ring.</p>
 <p>Having obtained the Purple Spirit Crystal, Xiao Yan restored the hole to its original condition. Following that, he got up and made a mad dash towards the tunnel’s exit. He continued running through the long tunnel and finally reached the intersection.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood there and alertly scanned his surroundings. A crazy happiness appeared on his face as he once again rushed with all his might towards the cave that led to where the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence was.</p>
 <p>After running for a long while, a familiar cave entrance appeared. Xiao Yan hurriedly stopped his advance and carefully checked the cave’s interior before reassuringly entering it.</p>
 <p>He sped towards the stone table where the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence was and greedily stared at the purple colored ball. Within it was a large amount of energy that was sufficient to help the young Amethyst Winged Lion be promoted by one rank. Even if he could not absorb all of it, it would be sufficient to raise his strength by a few stars.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking of the superb effect that this thing brought, Xiao Yan’s body trembled slightly. He flipped his hand prompting the sharp Purple Spirit Crystal to appear in his palm.</p>
 <p>Swallowing his saliva, Xiao Yan stared intently at the purple colored round ball and voiced the uncertainty in his heart, “Do I just smash it apart?”</p>
 <p>“I think so, I’ve never tried it.” Yao Lao’s uncertain voice sounded from within the ring.</p>
 <p>“If anything goes wrong, I’ll come after you!” Yao Lao’s uncertain voice immediately caused Xiao Yan to become a little perturbed. However, the situation did not allow him to give more thought. He tightly held the Purple Spirit Crystal and violently knocked it onto the purple colored ball.</p>
 <p>“Crack…” The Purple Spirit Crystal knocked against the tip of the round ball. After a brief silence, a crack line surfaced on it. A moment later, the crack line spread and the ball broke into pieces with a bang.</p>
 <p>Immediately after the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence broke, a purple colored liquid began to flow out from it, wetting half of the stone table.</p>
 <p>“Hurry, hurry. Use the jade bottle to store the purple colored liquid. This is the Amethyst Essence.!” Eyeing the liquid flowing out, Yao Lao hurriedly yelled.</p>
 <p>As Yao Lao’s voice died off, Xiao Yan, who had felt a great heartache, quickly took out some jade bottles from within the storage ring and used all his effort to pour the purple liquid into them.</p>
 <p>Although the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence outer shell was extremely hot, the liquid in it was abnormally warm.</p>
 <p>Despite the outer shell’s large size, the amount of this warm purple liquid it contained only allowed Xiao Yan to fill up six jade bottles.</p>
 <p>After dropping the last drop of the Amethyst Essence into the bottle, Xiao Yan glanced at the liquid that was spilled over the stone table. His mouth shivered at the heartache he felt. He stared at it for a moment before he suddenly pounced onto the stone table and licked up all the Amethyst Essence in the small depressions on the table under Yao Lao’s shocked expression.</p>
 <p>“Dammit… You’re really stubborn!”</p>
 <p>Looking at Xiao Yan’s manner, the speechless Yao Lao mimicked Xiao Yan’s language as a curse exploded from his mouth.</p>
