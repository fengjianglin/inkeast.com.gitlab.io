 <p><strong><u>Chapter 894: Five Star Dou Huang</u></strong></p>
 <p>Old Qian and Old Bai did not remain in the Inner Academy for long before they quietly disappeared just like they had appeared. In regards to their disappearance, Xiao Yan and the others did not feel any other emotion other than speechless. An expert must have the style of an expert.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan examined the corpse of the Old Ground Demon Ghost the two had left behind only to be surprised to discover that there was not the slightest spiritual trace. It was likely that this old fellow’s soul had been destroyed by Old Bai. Some cold sweat formed on his forehead after learning this. He did not know just what kind of grudge Old Bai had with this fellow to cause him to be this ruthless.</p>
 <p>Of course, Xiao Yan would not feel any pity for this old fellow. If Old Qian and Old Bai did not reveal themselves this time around, it was likely that the entire Inner Academy would become a wasteland under his frightening ‘Extermination Fire Lotus.’ At that time, he would become a sinner of the Jia Nan Academy.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not destroy the ice-cold corpse of the Old Ground Demon Ghost. Instead, he asked an Elder who specialized in ice affinity Dou Qi to freeze it in ice before he placed the body into his Storage Ring.</p>
 <p>The corpse of a seven star elite Dou Zong might not be of much use to an ordinary person, but Xiao Yan always remembered the refined body Yao Lao needed. Although he had obtained Yun Shan’s body back then, this Old Ground Demon Ghost’s body was undoubtedly a little stronger.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan dragged his tired body and returned to his room after storing the corpse properly. The soul-stirring battle today had exhausted him. If he had not wildly swallowed some medicinal pills at that time and had the help of Old Qian and Old Bai in suppressing the revolting medicinal strength within his body, it was likely that Xiao Yan would have fainted from the force of the wild, violent medicinal strength.</p>
 <p>Even though this was the case, the current Xiao Yan possessed both internal and external injuries. Adding this to his nearly shriveled Dou Qi, he was clearly seriously injured.</p>
 <p>Of course, even though his injuries were quite serious this time around, there was no need for the frequently injured Xiao Yan to be overly worried. Given sufficient time, he would recover sooner or later. After all, his spirit was far stronger than an ordinary expert. The many natural treasures he had consumed during these few years had not been expelled from his body like excretion.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sat cross-legged in a room with warm light. His hands formed a training seal and his eyes were slightly shut. Threads of energy lingered at the tip of his nose. Finally, they followed his breathing cycle and entered his body.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan mind had also sunk into his body during his training. He carefully investigated his body with it before the corner of his mouth let out a bitter smile. Unexpectedly, the injuries that he had suffered this time around had somewhat exceeded his expectations. It seemed that he would have to cautiously use this ‘Extermination Fire Lotus’ in the future.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan mind gradually became focused after understanding the injuries in his body. After which, he circulated his ‘Flame Mantra’ and once again maneuvered some of the medicinal strength that had appeared from consuming a large amount of medicinal pills. The Glazed Lotus Core Flame was subsequently summoned and began its refinement…</p>
 <p>The medicinal strength that was produced from such medicine might be able to achieve a supplement effect if one occasionally consumed small quantities of it. However, if one used a manner similar to how Xiao Yan gulped them down, one would cause these medicinal strengths to become unusually wild, violent due to the mixture. Therefore, it would not only be difficult to heal one’s injuries but it would also worsen the internal injuries of one’s body. Hence, all of these mixed medicines must be refined before he healed his injuries…</p>
 <p>Given the ability of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, it was naturally not too troublesome to refine these medicinal strengths. He had not done it during the daytime because he could not spare it any attention. Now that he was free, the refinement would not exhaust too much time.</p>
 <p>The refinement continued for around half an hour or so before the threads of wild and violent medicinal strength mixed within his body were completely refined by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame. Finally, they transformed into a pure, gentle medicinal strength that followed the veins as they flowed slowly, healing some of the injuries that his veins had received.</p>
 <p>On the bed, Xiao Yan gently exhaled as he sensed the faint pain within his body gradually disappear. His injuries required some time to recuperate. Currently, the Dou Qi in his body was at a deficit, and he needed to train to fill it. If such an empty condition was maintained for too long, it would leave lasting harm on his strength.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hands once again displayed training seals as he gradually shut his eyes. His breathing became calm and the space around his body fluctuated slightly. Immediately, strings of powerful natural energy followed the pores around his body before pouring into it unceasingly. After the refinement by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the energy transformed into the purest Dou Qi as merged with Xiao Yan’s limbs…</p>
 <p>This training continued for around four hours or so. When Xiao Yan once again opened his eyes, the tired and empty feeling within his body was wholly expelled. Just when Xiao Yan was about to withdraw from his training state, a strange feeling suddenly surged in his heart…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind followed this strange feeling as he automatically circulated the ‘Flame Mantra.’ With the swift circulation of the Flame Mantra, the natural energy within the room immediately began to intensely fluctuate. Immediately, numerous powerful energies surged toward Xiao Yan from all directions…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he saw this strange scene. A joy that was difficult to contain immediately surged into his heart. He was currently no longer some novice who knew nothing. Such a situation was something that would only appear when one was advancing.</p>
 <p>It had been some time since Xiao Yan had gained the strength of a four star Dou Huang. Of course, he could have advanced quite some time ago during this period of time. However, he did not choose the method of relying on other items to quickly advance. He clearly understood in his heart that this kind of steady one-star-at-a-time increase was the most stable. Such stability would make a firm foundation when he advanced to an even higher level in the future.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan might have given up many faster methods, but after today’s soul-stirring big battle, the time was ripe. The joy and satisfaction of advancing without being stimulated by any external items filled his body. Countless numbers of cells within him were also emitting cheers at this moment. His originally full muscles and bones began to greedily absorb the Dou Qi within his body while his tough veins had also taken this opportune time to become even tougher…</p>
 <p>More and more natural energy was poured into Xiao Yan’s body. Xiao Yan did not reject the mottled natural energy. The Glazed Lotus Heart Flame was just like a refining fire dragon that lingered within his body. Any energy that entered it would be wrapped by the flame immediately. After undergoing the refinement at a frighteningly high temperature, the impurities in the natural energy were washed away, transforming it into pure energy that followed the Flame Mantra Qi Method to complete a full cycle. Eventually, it agglomerated into the purest Dou Qi, which was absorbed by his uncountable cells, bones, muscles, and other organs in his body…</p>
 <p>The ripple within the room continued for around two hours or so before it gradually diminished. The room once again returned to its silence after the final thread of natural energy was poured into Xiao Yan’s body…</p>
 <p>A young man on the bed had his eyes tightly shut. His eyes did not rise or fall by even a little, and the breathing from his nose was nearly inaudible. If his body was still not emitting some heat, it was likely that anyone would have treated him as a corpse.</p>
 <p>This silence continued for a moment before a turbid breath from the young man’s mouth finally broke it. His eyes twitched slightly as they slowly opened. A glaring glow flashed within those dark-black night-like eyes. Under this glow, even the light in the room appeared somewhat dark.</p>
 <p>The glow within Xiao Yan’s eyes continued for a moment longer before it was completely withdrawn. Xiao Yan’s hands gently pressed on the bed and his body agily leaped up from it. His body stood extremely straight as a sharp aura swept out.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan spread his hands and they shook slightly. The bones all over his body appeared to be alive as they pressed and squeezed together, emitting waves of clear sounds. These slight sounds even carried traces of a deep thunderous roar, that were quite mysterious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hands suddenly tensed as he sensed the replenished feeling within his body. His fist swiftly struck out. As his fist appeared, a whistling sound from the tearing of the air repeatedly resounded within the room. With his current strength, a simple ordinary fist technique was used in a mighty fashion by him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan adjusted a little before slowly coming to a stop. He spread both his arms and sensed his body being filled with Dou Qi. He involuntarily smiled. This advancement had not only caused his strength to advance, but the injuries within his body had mostly healed. This had somewhat exceeded Xiao Yan’s expectations. Originally, according to his many injuries, he would at least need to recuperate for an entire month in order to be fully healed. It was unexpected that he was more than half recovered after this advancement. This unexpected gain had caused Xiao Yan to feel quite joyful.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly focused his mind. His eyes flickered slightly as he widened his mouth. Immediately a cluster of grayish-brown flames slowly drifted out.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan studied this cluster of grayish-brown flame called the ‘Life Transforming Flame.’ However, he became somewhat hesitant as he did so. He naturally knew that if he were to refine it at this moment, his strength would definitely be able to advance a little. Yet, if he did this, he would lose a trump card to protect his life. He was about to make a trip to a place that gathered the peak experts of the entire continent, the Central Plains. Failing to have a sufficiently strong skill to protect his life in that place, which was filled with danger, would be quite a troublesome thing…</p>
 <p>In that case… should he refine it now? Or should he leave it for future use?</p>
 <p>For an instant, Xiao Yan could not help but face uncertainty.</p>
