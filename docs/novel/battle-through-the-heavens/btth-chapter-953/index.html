 <p><strong><u>Chapter 953: Intervene</u></strong></p>
 <p>The sudden unexpected turn of events caused the situation to immediately change a little. The eyes of the Hong Mu and Hong Lie cautiously swept around them. They immediately spoke in a deep voice, “Friend, this is a matter between the Hong clan and the Han clan. Please give our Hong clan this face!”</p>
 <p>Han Chong’s group was also hurriedly looking in all directions while Hong Lie’s group’s gazes were sweeping all around. At this moment, they had sensed that something was not quite right. If they met with a helper the first time something happened, they could attribute it to their good lucky. However, they were actually able to meet with a helper at a critical juncture the second time. This… was a little illogical.</p>
 <p>Han Xue acted differently from the surprise of Han Chong’s group. Her pretty eyes stared at that carriage. Being female, she was exceptionally meticulous over some small matters. She was certain that the voice from earlier was quite similar to Xiao Yan’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Creak…”</p>
 <p>While the people from both parties were muttering in their hearts, a soft creaking sound slowly sounded. Everyone’s gazes randomly looked over, only to see a linen-clothed, young man slowly descending from a carriage.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan?’</p>
 <p>Han Chong’s group was stunned when they saw Xiao Yan reveal himself. They immediately came to some sudden understanding. Shock and disbelief swiftly surged into their eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan spread his hands toward everyone before sighing helplessly. He slowly stepped forward and stopped beside Han Xue. He looked at her searing, pretty eyes before involuntarily revealing a bitter smile as he asked, “Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>“It really is you!”</p>
 <p>Han Xue’s pretty eyes did not blink as they stared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, a slyness suddenly surfaced on her beautiful face as she spoke each word softly with a pause between them.</p>
 <p>“The instincts of a woman are really frightening…” Xiao Yan helplessly replied.</p>
 <p>“Being able to come back alive and kicking within a short couple of days after suffering such a serious injury is not something that an ordinary person can do.” Han Xue softly laughed.</p>
 <p>“Xiao… brother Xiao… you… you are that mysterious strong person?’</p>
 <p>Han Chong by the side gradually widened his eyes when he heard the conversation between Xiao Yan and Han Xue. Finally, he asked with a stutter. He had never expected that the mysterious expert, whom they had been frequently talking about during these few days, was actually by their side.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan could only nod his head as he looked at the shock in everyone’s eyes. He immediately waved his hand and said, “We’ll talk about it after settling the trouble here.”</p>
 <p>Everyone nodded when they heard his words. After which, their gazes turned to Hong Lie’s group. At this moment, however, there was no longer the kind of expression earlier that was unafraid of death. Instead, they gradually had a little boldness. After Xiao Yan had intervened the last time, they already had some rough understanding of Xiao Yan’s strength.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? You seem to appear quite unfamiliar. I think that it should be your first time arriving in Tian Bei City, right?” Hong Mu halted Hong Lie, whose face was already covered with a fierce aura. His eyes focused on Xiao Yan as he spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Bring your men away. I will temporarily protect the people here.” Xiao Yan’s gaze swept over Hong Mu. His voice was still calm and rippleless.</p>
 <p>“Do you really wish to offend my Hong clan?” Hong Mu’s face twitched slightly upon hearing this. His voice had an additional thread of coldness to it.</p>
 <p>“At the very least, the two of you don’t have the qualification to capture a person in front of me.” Xiao Yan smiled as he replied. His tone had some pride that was difficult to extinguish. This pride came from the confidence he had in his strength.</p>
 <p>“What an arrogant brat. If you did not have the advantage of a sneak attack, how would you have been able to force back the old me? Moreover, there are two of us here!” Xiao Yan’s attitude caused the fury in Hong Lie’s heart to immediately rise. He ended up laughing in his extreme anger.</p>
 <p>“Leave with me…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his head. He ignored these two noisy fellows, turned his head, and softly said to Han Xue.</p>
 <p>Han Xue was startled when she heard this. While she was still shocked, Xiao Yan in front of her had stepped forward, walking slowly away.</p>
 <p>Han Xue suddenly felt an unknown boldness and safe feeling surfacing from her heart as she stared at the skinny back of the person wearing ordinary linen clothes. She immediately clenched her silver teeth, waved her hand, and softly cried, “Follow!”</p>
 <p>The convoy slowly moved. After which, it steadily followed behind Xiao Yan under a kind of strange atmosphere. The people around the convoy and Han Xue felt some perspiration faintly appearing on their palms. Currently, the only one who could be relied upon was that skinny back in front of them…</p>
 <p>Hong Mu’s face was gloomy as he watched Xiao Yan and the convoy behind him slowly walk over. His heart had a faint killing intent churning within it. He had some difficulty clearly seeing Xiao Yan’s exact strength. However, from the way he forced back Hong Lie earlier, it was likely that the he was an expert Dou Huang. Moreover, this person’s level was not weaker than theirs</p>
 <p>Compared to the gloomy Hong Mu, the somewhat irritable Hong Lie had an unusually ugly expression. Xiao Yan’s actions basically completely looked down on them. It was really the first time that they had meet such an arrogant young person in so many years.</p>
 <p>Hong Lie’s fist was slowly tightened. Creaking sounds were repeatedly emitted from it. A moment later, a ferociousness finally flashed across his eyes as he cried out, “Kill!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the cry from Hong Lie, the numerous black figures from behind furiously shouted. They tightened their grip on their weapons as they carried a dense killing aura that could not be dispersed. They charged toward the convoy.</p>
 <p>The expressions of Han Chong’s group changed slightly upon seeing the opponent launch an attack. They tightened their grip on their weapons. When they were prepared to charge forward and meet the other party, Xiao Yan in front halted his footsteps. He extended his hand and gently clenched it!</p>
 <p>An invisible ripple swiftly spread out as he clenched his hand. Immediately, the numerous black figures, that were charging over with killing intent all over their bodies, suddenly paused. Their bodies turned fiery-red almost instantly. A moment later, they spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and strangely fell down like wheat being cut…</p>
 <p>The fresh blood that they spat out emitted a ‘chi chi’ sound upon landing on the ground. They swiftly transformed into a green vapor that completely dispersed…</p>
 <p>Shock was faintly revealed in the eyes of Han Chong’s group when they saw this scene. They recalled the countless numbers of poisonous snakes that had suddenly turned into ashes in the gorge back then. From the looks of it, Xiao Yan had held back. Otherwise, it was likely that these fellows would have shared the same fate as those poisonous snakes…</p>
 <p>“Attack!”</p>
 <p>Hong Mu eyes also shrank. He remembered the instructions from the clan head to capture Han Xue alive at all cost. He immediately inhaled a deep breath and suddenly let out a stern cry!</p>
 <p>The cry had just left his mouth when Hong Mu moved together with him. They transformed into two red figures. Powerful Dou Qi surged from their bodies without holding back. Wherever they passed, the wild and violent Dou Qi would leave behind two deep gullies on the ground.</p>
 <p>Two Dou Huang’s aura came pressing down like a storm, causing Han Xue and the others to feel an illusion that their breathing had come to a stop. However, that linen-clothed, young man’s footsteps did not stop in front of them.</p>
 <p>“Mysterious Fire Move!”</p>
 <p>“Wood Aura Rise!”</p>
 <p>Two cries erupted from Hong Lie and Hong Mu’s mouth. Immediately, a hot-red glow swept out like a flame. Behind it was a green-colored Dou Qi, which swiftly chased after it and merged into the flame. Immediately, the fiery-red Dou Qi’s momentum soared. The hot temperature caused the withered yellow leaves on the sides of the road to emit a ‘chi’ sound as ignited by themselves.</p>
 <p>“Not a bad Dou Qi merger. However, fire is useless against me…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s footsteps finally paused as he looked at the furious dragon like hot flame that came toward him. He reached out with his hand and a jade-green flame suddenly shot out like a fire python.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The two attacks collided with a ‘bang.’ However, that enormous hot flame seemed to have met a thunderstorm. Its speed became sluggish while the jade-green flame, that was not even as thick as an arm, completely swallowed it in one gulp after twining a couple of times…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeves after swallowing the combined attacks of Hong Mu and Hong Lie in an extremely relaxed manner. That jade-green flame transformed into lightning that shot out. Immediately, the tail of the flame was swung, forming numerous afterimages as it struck the chests of the two, who could not dodge in time.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang!” A low, deep sound was emitted as the two figures flew backwards.</p>
 <p>Hong Chong’s group emitted an exclamation as they looked at Hong Lie and Hong Mu who were swiftly moving backwards with their feet rubbing over the ground. An unusual color also flashed over Han Xue’s beautiful eyes. In the Han clan, her talent was only a little weaker than her elder sister. However, if she were to be compared with Xiao Yan in front of her, there was far too large of a gap. His age seemed to be similar to hers but even Hong Lie and Hong Mu, two Elders of the Hong clan who possessed quite a strong reputation within the Tian Bei City were actually so miserably defeated… such a talent and achievement would likely not lose to even Hong Chen from the Hong clan…</p>
 <p>“This person is too strong, retreat!”</p>
 <p>Hong Lie and Hong Mu, whose feet were deeply rooted in the ground, managed to stabilize their bodies with much difficulty. A paleness surfaced on their faces. The young man in front of them appeared quite young, but his strength far exceeded them. It was completely pointless to continue remaining in this place. At that moment, Hong Mu decisively let out a low cry.</p>
 <p>An unwillingness flashed across Hong Lie’s face when he heard Hong Mu’s cry. All he could do was nod his head. Dou Qi wings appeared on their backs and they immediately turned into two vague figures that flew away in an attempt to flee for their lives.</p>
 <p>“Since you have already attacked, it is only natural that you cannot be allowed to leave so easily…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his head as he watched the two people quickly retreat. A cluster of invisible flames suddenly appeared in front of him, and a ripple swiftly spread.</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>The invisible ripple caught up to the two fleeing people in a lightning-like manner. Immediately, the bodies of the two suddenly paused. A mouthful of hot fresh blood was spat out from each of them. Before they had the time to flee, a figure had appeared behind them in a ghost-like manner. With a flick of the figure’s finger, a wind shot out and the sight of the two suddenly turned black.</p>
 <p>This change had occurred in a split second. Han Xue and the others only sensed that the scene in front of their eyes as a blur. By the time they had recovered an instant later, two figures were being thrown down. They landed under their feet like corpses. A faint voice immediately sounded.</p>
 <p>“I will let you deal with them…”</p>
 <p>Han Xue lowered her head and looked at the pale-faced Hong Mu and Hong Lie. She did not know whether they were dead or alive. As she looked, she involuntarily inhaled a deep breath of air despite her cold and indifferent character…</p>
 <p>Directly capturing two four star Dou Huangs within less than ten short exchanges. Even in her Han clan, it would be difficult to find many people with such strength…</p>
