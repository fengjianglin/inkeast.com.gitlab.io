 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1269: Help</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was somewhat gloomy as he watched these two human figures that had suddenly appeared. These two individuals had white hair. They were wearing grayish-white robes. A pair of wings were gently being flapped on the backs of these two old fellows. A faint lightning sound vaguely resounded. Xiao Yan had seen this pair of wings on Huang Xuan. Hence, he also understood that these two people were likely experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe.</p>
 <p>“Two five star Dou Zuns…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over these two indifferent looking old men. His heart sunk involuntarily. The strength of these two were not inferior to old ghost Zhai Xing. This Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe was indeed worthy of being one of the three top tribes of the Magical Beast world. Two experts of such a level had actually appeared together.</p>
 <p>“Is this this reinforcements from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe… that old fellow Huang Xuan was actually purposefully delaying time until the arrival of the reinforcements.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes flickered rapidly. His fist also suddenly tightened.</p>
 <p>“The bone wings of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe… brat, your boldness is really great…” An old man wearing a grayish-white robe glanced at Xiao Yan before pausing his eyes on the pair of bone wings on the latter’s back. The corner of his eyes were lifted slightly as he spoke in an indifferent voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were gloomy. His body pulled back slightly. Two five star Dou Zuns and an old ghost Zhai Xing looking with ill intent from the side. If the situation was not handled well today, it was likely that he would really end up dying today.</p>
 <p>“There is no need for any unnecessary words. Capture this brat, tear the bone wings off and bring him back to the tribe to be punished!” The other elder from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe spoke with a cold expression, “We must heavily punish such actions. Otherwise, how can we deter others in the future?”</p>
 <p>“Ugh, it’s just as well. We’ll capture him, cripple his Dou Qi and let him kneel in the tomb for his entire life!” The grayish-white robed elder nodded. A cold glint flashed within his eyes. The Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe greatly valued the corpse of their tribe members. Anyone who dares to commit even the slightest blasphemy against a corpse of a tribe member will be chased by them with a murderous intent. This had resulted in them having not met anyone who dared to use the wings of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe to create a flying Dou Skill for many years. Xiao Yan was the first today!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed furiously when he head the decision of these two old fellows that were made as though no one else was present. He curled his hand and three types of Heavenly Flame gathered. After which, it formed a beautiful exquisite fire lotus rapidly. A trace of destructive force quietly spread from it when the fire lotus was formed. This caused the energy of this place to fluctuate intensely.</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>The two elders from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe were also startled when they sensed the might of the fire lotus in Xiao Yan’s palm. A low and deep exclamation was emitted from their mouths. They were clearly very surprised that Xiao Yan was actually able to use a Dou Skill of such might.</p>
 <p>“Two misters, this is a fire lotus that is formed from the merger of three types of Heavenly Flames. Do not underestimate it.” Old ghost Zhai Xing in the distance watched the fire lotus in Xiao Yan’s hands with horrified eyes before issuing a warning.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>The two of them nodded indifferently but did not respond. Their eyes stared at Xiao Yan and said, “The old me also sense the smell of the Demon Phoenix essence blood. Brat, you have broken all the taboos of my Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. He flicked his finger and the fire lotus in his hand rose. After which, it was accompanied by a fire tail as it gently rushed towards the two old men.</p>
 <p>The two old men let out a cold snort when they saw the fire lotus rushing over. Vast ocean like powerful Dou Qi surged out from the bodies of the two of them like a volcano. It vaguely gathered and formed an unusually large Heaven Phoenix shape above their heads.</p>
 <p>“Explode!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed coldly when he saw this. A thought passed through his heart and the fire lotus that flew close to those two instantly bloomed. Immediately, a ‘bang’ sounded as it exploded in an earthshaking manner!</p>
 <p>“Humph, Demon Phoenix Bell!”</p>
 <p>The expressions of those two elders sunk as the frightening fire storm swept over. They formed some mysterious seals with their hands with lightning like speed. Within the blink of an eye, it formed a thousand feet large energy bell in the midair, completely covering the fire storm that had swept over.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The firestorm heavily collided onto the wall and the energy of this entire place became restless at this moment. A thunder like metallic sound resounded beside everyone’s ears, causing the Dou Qi within their bodies to tremble intensely.</p>
 <p>A frightening firestorm spread inside the Demon Phoenix Bell. That destructive force ruthlessly collided onto the walls of the bell. Glaring sparks appeared as the Demon Phoenix bell shook continuously. There was actually a slight crack line vaguely spreading within it.</p>
 <p>The expressions of those two elders changed slightly when they saw the tiny crack line spreading on the Demon Phoenix bell. They felt some disbelief within their hearts. The Demon Phoenix Bell that was created by the two of them together could trap a five star Dou Zun. Yet, it was currently showing signs of cracking apart in the hands of a little fellow, whose aura was that of a mere three star Dou Zun?</p>
 <p>“This brat is a little strange…”</p>
 <p>The two elders exchanged looks and gently nodded. They waved their sleeves. Vast and mighty Dou Qi swiftly surged out from within their bodies. After which, it was poured into the Demon Phoenix Bell, causing the enormous bell to emit a kind of unusual luster.</p>
 <p>“Explode!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression sunk slightly as he watched the fire storm that was being trapped within the bell. A thought passed through his mind and the might of the fire lotus suddenly erupted completely!</p>
 <p>“Clang! Clang! Clang!”</p>
 <p>The firestorm collided wildly on the enormous bell, emitting a deafening earthshaking noise. At the same time, it caused the Demon Phoenix Bell to tremble intensely.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The two Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe’s elders once again had a change in expression when they saw the Demon Phoenix Bell trembling intensely. Before they could continue to strengthen it, however, they heard a loud ‘bang’. That incomparably solid Demon Phoenix Bell was completely blasted apart in front of their stunned gazes.</p>
 <p>“Humph…”</p>
 <p>The two experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe were implicated when the Demon Phoenix Bell exploded. A low and deep moan was emitted from their mouths. Their feet were also shaken until they took two steps back.</p>
 <p>“An insignificant tactic!”</p>
 <p>After swiftly stabilizing their bodies, the two grayish-white clothed elders glanced at the annihilation firestorm that followed. They stood with their hands behind them and laughed coldly. However, no one saw that the hands under their sleeves had involuntarily trembled at this moment…</p>
 <p>“Two idiots…”</p>
 <p>A short distance away, Old ghost Zhai Xing watched these two experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe and involuntarily shook his heads. With his ability, he was naturally able to sense that these two old fellows had suffered some hidden losses because they had joined hands and act strong.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the fire lotus that was formed from the merger of three types of Heavenly Flames being blocked, Xiao Yan frowned a little. He immediately glanced at those two elders and a cold smile involuntarily surfaced on his face as he asked, “You two, are you feeling a little terrible?”</p>
 <p>That gray clothed old man’s face sunk slightly when he heard this. He spoke faint, “Razor tongue brat. Bring yourself with you and obediently return with us to the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. We do not wish to use force. However, you should be able to see the situation here clearly. Today, all of you will not be able to escape…”</p>
 <p>“Chi…”</p>
 <p>A couple of figures flashed over from the midair when this old man’s voice sounded. Finally, they paused beside Xiao Yan. They were Little Fairy Doctor’s group.</p>
 <p>“We have been surrounded…” Little Fairy Doctor’s words caused Xiao Yan’s heart to sink. Only then did he turn his gaze. He discovered that nearly a hundred figures had appeared around the square at some unknown time. Powerful auras spread over the place. Clearly, this was the reinforcement that the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe had called.</p>
 <p>“This Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe really hold us in high regard…” Even Xiao Yan involuntarily sighed and slowly said when he saw this situation.</p>
 <p>Adding these two old men who had suddenly appeared, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe had four five star Dou Zuns. This lineup was sufficient to be worthy of the description ‘terrifying’. Although that old fellow’s tone was arrogant, it must be said that the situation today really appeared as though Xiao Yan’s group would have difficulty escaping…</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, hand over the Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit. We might allow your companions to leave. Otherwise, do not blame my Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe for engaging in a slaughter today!” Huang Xuan was suspended in the empty air. His arms hugged his chest as he let out a cold cry.</p>
 <p>“The Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe is really acting in a mighty manner!” Zi Yan laughed coldly.</p>
 <p>Huang Xuan’s eyes narrowed. He stared at Zi Yan and slowly said, “Ancient Void Dragon. Indeed, we do not wish to offend you but my Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe will not hold back even a little for the Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit!”</p>
 <p>“What should we do? This situation is bad. Four five star Dou Zuns. This lineup is even more frightening than when we were at the branch hall of the Hall of Soul.” Tian Huo zun-zhe frowned and asked.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. A crazy expression gradually surged up his face. If this Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe force him to his limit, he could only once again use the Annihilation Lotus Flame. With his current strength, it was likely that even four five star Dou Zun would have difficulty blocking the Annihilation Lotus Flame that he unleash. Although he would directly enter a weakened state after this, he had no other choice at this critical moment.</p>
 <p>“There is no need for all of you to act. Leave it to me…”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan appeared to be aware of Xiao Yan’s thoughts. She shook her head slightly as the tattoo on her small hand wiggled. That Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit slowly appeared. She lifted this fruit and stood in the empty space. Her eyes were cold and indifferent as he looked at Huang Xuan and the two Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe Elders, whose eyes were covered with greed. At the same time, she coldly laughed, “The Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit is here. Come and take it if you have the ability!”</p>
 <p>Little Fairy Doctor’s group was startled when they saw Zi Yan’s action. They were about to speak when they were stopped by Xiao Yan at the side. The latter shook his head. Zi Yan might be mischievous but she was not a fool. She should have her reason for this action of hers.</p>
 <p>“Humph, a mere child Ancient Void Dragon. Do you really think the old me is afraid of you!”</p>
 <p>Huang Xuan’s eyes exchanged looks with the two other Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe elders. He nodded a little. Immediately, their bodies rushed out at the same time. The three of them had actually attacked together and charge at Zi Yan in a ferocious manner.</p>
 <p>The speed of Huang Xuan trio was extremely frightening. Within the blink of an eye, they had appeared over a dozen metres in front of Zi Yan. Their eyes were crazily staring at the fruit that was emitting an unusual fragrance. Once they had this thing, a new supreme Magical Beast bloodline would appear in the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. This kind of bloodline would be even more powerful than the Ancient Void Dragon!</p>
 <p>“The Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit belongs to my Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe!”</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>However, just when the hands of those three were about to grab the Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit on Zi Yan’s little hand, the space beside Zi Yan suddenly emitted a ripping sound. It split and formed a large hole. Immediately, a strong figure strided out of the space. This figure had just appeared when an extremely powerful pressure suddenly descended. Under this pressure, the faces of those Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe experts immediately became pale. The forward charging figures of Huang Xuan trio suddenly stiffened. A shocked expression swiftly spread over their faces.</p>
 <p>A human figure appeared. Along with it, a furious domineering laughter immediately rumbled over this entire place!</p>
 <p>“Is a tribe member of my Ancient Void Dragon tribe someone that you frivolous birds can touch?”</p>
