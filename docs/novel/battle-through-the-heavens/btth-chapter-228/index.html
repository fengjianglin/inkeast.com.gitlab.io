 <p><strong><u>Chapter 228: Detaching The Flame Seed</u></strong></p>
 <p>Within the bright cave, the green-colored flame writhed intensely. Traces of prominent distortion clearly appeared in the air surrounding the flame following the writhing of the cluster of the flame seedling. It was unexpected that the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’s’ temperature would be so terrifying…</p>
 <p>As the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ gradually became wilder, Yao Lao, who was first to sense this, swiftly spread out his powerful Spiritual Strength and completely covered the entire cave. At the same time, he isolated the extremely high temperature that appeared in the cave.</p>
 <p>In midair, the green-colored flame’s, enlarged by the wind, expanded by nearly a hundred times in the blink of an eye. Following the change of its size, the originally warm and soothing flame had become wild and violent. The flame whistled as it writhed, releasing a ‘chi chi’ sound. The surrounding air was also incinerated by the hot green flame into nothingness.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan focused his gaze on the enormous green flame in midair before turning his head around to look at Yao Lao. He waited for the latter to nod his head. Then he took in a deep breath of hot air. His hand, which was covered by a blood-colored cuticle, shakingly aimed at the green flame and released a violent suction force.</p>
 <p>When sucking the ‘Heavenly Flame’, the suction force, which could usually easily suck a huge rock over was only able to slowly move the ‘Heavenly Flame’ through the air. Moreover, each time the shapeless suction force came into contact with the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, it could only endure for two to three seconds before it would be incinerated into nothingness by the terrifying heat.</p>
 <p>Therefore, even though Xiao Yan and the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ may have only been a few meters apart, the amount of Dou Qi exhausted was an enormous.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes stared intently at the green-colored flame that was slowly moving over. His breathing was somewhat rapid and his forehead was covered in perspiration. The perspiration followed the contours of his face as it flowed down. Under the reflection from the blood-colored cuticle, it appeared to be droplets of bright red, fresh blood.</p>
 <p>As the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ gradually grew closer, the terrifying heat energy that it emitted caused even the face of Yao Lao to the side to reveal some shock. Clearly, the energy contained within this ‘Heavenly Flame’, that was ranked nineteenth on the ‘Heavenly Flame Ranking’, seemed to have exceeded even his expectations.</p>
 <p>When the enormous green-colored flame stopped around a meter in front of Xiao Yan, the terrifying heat that it emitted still caused some of the hard green stone to gradually crack despite Yao Lao having used his Spiritual Strength to isolate the inside of the cave. A moment later, some of the huge stones transformed into numerous small stones which were incinerated into piles of green-colored fine powder.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s face was filled with seriousness as he eyed the huge green-colored flame that had stopped in front of Xiao Yan. The somewhat blurry body surface of Yao Lao suddenly began to fluctuate intensely like a water wave. Seeing his body’s change, Yao Lao’s expression changed slightly. His pair of hands formed seals in a lightning like matter and let out a low cry. Instantly, thick white-colored flame swiftly rose from his body and gradually stopped when it covered all of it.</p>
 <p>After summoning the ‘Bone Chilling Flame’, Yao Lao once again became calm. He took a few small steps back, stared intently at the writhing green-colored flame with a serious, old face, and quickly said, “Extend your hands into the green-colored flame. The middle of the cluster of the flame should form the wisp of the flame seed. Take it out! Hurry!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Yao Lao’s words, Xiao Yan’s body trembled slightly. Under the blood-colored cuticle, a pair of eyes were opened wide. Xiao Yan pulled the corner of his mouth in some disbelief. Extend his hand into the flame? Was that not seeking death?</p>
 <p>The dumfounded thought swiftly flashed across his heart. A moment later, he calmed down his mind from its stunned state. Since Yao Lao had told him this, then he should do as told. He did not have even the slightest experience when it came to swallowing a ‘Heavenly Flame’. Therefore, he could only follow Yao Lao’s every order…</p>
 <p>Although when swallowing the ‘Heavenly Flame’, any little mistake would result in the backlash from the ‘Heavenly Flame’ turning one into a pile of ashes, Xiao Yan was able to give Yao Lao an unreserved amount of trust.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded his chin without anyone noticing before suddenly raising his head. He stared intently at the green-colored flame that was getting closer. His slightly trembling hand opened and closed slightly, preparing to charge into the ‘Heavenly Flame’ at any moment.</p>
 <p>When the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ arrived to a spot around two to three feet from Xiao Yan, the surrounding hard mountain rock ground had already been incinerated into a huge hole. This result was something that occurred even with Yao Lao’s effort of protection in place. If Yao Lao were to withdraw the protection from the Spiritual Strength, the entire mountain peak would be incinerated into a pile of ashes in an extremely short time.</p>
 <p>The green lotus emitted a faint green-colored glow as Xiao Yan sat cross legged on its lotus seat. This layer of glow helped Xiao Yan block a large portion of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ temperature. Even with this, there was still some residual temperature that managed to seep in, causing the blood-colored cuticle to form droplets of bright red liquid.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s dark black eyes were reflected the green-colored demonic and exotic flame as he eyed the enormous flame that had stopped in front of him. His throat rolled slightly before he clenched his teeth violently and slowly extended his hand, which was covered with the blood-colored cuticles, into the cluster of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’.</p>
 <p>Following his hand’s gradual extension into the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, the layer of blood-colored cuticles on his arm began to swiftly melt. Droplets of blood like liquid repeatedly dripped down. Each time a drop of liquid left his hand, it would swiftly be incinerated by the green-colored flame into nothingness.</p>
 <p>Although the blood-colored cuticle melted extremely quickly within the ‘Heavenly Flame’, the medicinal strength of the ‘Blood Lotus Pill’ within Xiao Yan’s body released a never ending amount of dark and cold energy as the cuticle melted. These energies passed through his Qi Paths before swiftly and completely repairing the melted blood-colored cuticle on his hand.</p>
 <p>Under this cycle of continuous melting and replacement, Xiao Yan’s hand was finally completely extended into the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>Being in such close contact with the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, the blood-colored cuticle all over Xiao Yan’s body began to show signs of melting with varying intensity. After which, the blood-colored liquid dripped down like flowing water. At a glance, it appeared as though fresh blood was continuously being emitted from within his pores. HIs delicate and handsome face was also currently covered by the tumbling fresh blood, like a demon that had climbed out of hell. Overall, he appeared extremely terrifying.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stared intently at the continuously writhing green-colored flame with unblinking eyes. His hand swiftly grasped within the ‘Heavenly Flame’. This was the first time he had come into such close contact with a ‘Heavenly Flame’ that was not controlled by anyone. Although there was some bizarre novelty, there was a greater amount of uneasiness and apprehension. Under this kind of situation, if the blood-colored cuticle on his hand failed to be replaced in time, then Xiao Yan would turn into a pile of ashes within a short few seconds.</p>
 <p>From underneath the blood-colored cuticle, perspiration dripped from Xiao Yan’s forehead, entering his eyes. There was a soreness and swelling pain in his eyes from the salty sweat but he did not dare blink his eyes even once. He tightly pressed his mouth together as his palm slowly made its way within the green-colored flame inch by inch.</p>
 <p>When Xiao Yan was searching for the wisp of flame seed of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, he could not helped but be shocked and amazed by the high temperature of the ‘Heavenly Flame’. The temperature it contained had far exceeded Xiao Yan’s expectations. Even though he had prepared many things, the terrifying high temperature carried by the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ still slowly seeped past the blood-colored cuticle and the green lotus energy cover’s defense, causing the skin of Xiao Yan, who had been hiding under them, to become red, much like a searing hot iron.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth as he bared the intense burning pain. Through the corner of his eyes, he swiftly glanced at his surroundings and was somewhat appalled to find that the small cave had expanded to two times it’s original size.</p>
 <p>At this time, the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ seemed to have realized the intentions of Xiao Yan. Instantly, it started turn and the natural energy contained within the surrounding space began to riot. Multi-colored mottled energy slowly flowed, much like a colorful river, appearing extremely dazzling.</p>
 <p>The multi-colored mottled energy spiraled around the surroundings of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’. Occasionally, a wisp of flame would pounce on it. Immediately, these round shaped mottled energy rings would appear like donuts which had been bitten off by a dog, leaving it with missing and chipped edges.</p>
 <p>Following the sudden uprising of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame,’ the originally terrifying temperature within the cave immediately rose sharply. The surroundings within the mountain cave began to swiftly crack under this sudden sharp rise in temperature. Numerous huge crack lines quietly spread and in only a moment, they covered the entire mountain cave. Looking at the interior which had been damaged until it was full of holes, it probably would have collapsed long ago had it not been for Yao Lao’s support.</p>
 <p>“What a terrifying destructive power. If it were to be thrown into a city, it might be able to incinerate a huge city into ruins within an hour.” Eyeing the inner part of the mountain cave which had undergone a drastic change in only a mere moment, palpitations surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face. He muttered the words before quickly turning his gaze towards Yao Lao.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Yao Lao had a tension filled face as he stared at every action the green-colored flame made. Upon sensing Xiao Yan looking over, the tensed face of Yao Lao became slightly gentle and gave Xiao Yan a comforting smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan faced the forceful smile of Yao Lao and nodded. Suddenly, his eyebrows lifted. An unrestrained joy surged over his face as he hurriedly turned his head around, focusing his gaze intently within the green-colored flame.</p>
 <p>The hand that was covered by a blood-colored cuticle crazily started wildly grasped around within the green-colored flame. An instant later, the swiftly dancing hand suddenly stiffened. A smile gradually climbed onto the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth.</p>
 <p>On one side, Yao Lao gave a huge sigh of relief when he saw Xiao Yan’s expression. Although the blood armor coagulated by the ‘Blood Lotus Pill’ was strong, it could not withstand a prolonged grilling by the ‘Heavenly Flame’. Once the blood armor vaporized because of the exhaustion of its energy, Xiao Yan’s attempt at swallowing of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ this time around would have to be declared as a failure.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand tightly grabbed something that’s substance was like that of an actual seed. He clenched his hand and withstood the burning pain from his palm as he gradually withdrew his hand from within the green-colored flame.</p>
 <p>When Xiao Yan’s hand had finally withdrew from the green-colored flame, he found a wisp of green-colored lava liquid that was squirming in his palm.</p>
 <p>“Is this the Flame Seed of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’?” Staring at the wisp of green-colored lava that was emitting a frightening temperature, Xiao Yan blinked his eyes and softly muttered.</p>
