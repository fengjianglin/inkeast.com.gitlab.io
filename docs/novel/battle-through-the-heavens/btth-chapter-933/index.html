 <p><strong><u>Chapter 933: The Mighty Pressure from the Bloodline</u></strong></p>
 <p>The most important part of refining a medicinal pill was to perfectly merge the various medicinal strengths within the many medicinal ingredients. This merger process needed to be maintained with precise control. That’s why Spiritual Strength was the most important thing in determining the achievement of an alchemist.</p>
 <p>This unexpected change that had occurred this time around seemed to have been beyond Xiao Yan’s expectations. The reason was that every step he took earlier were completely done by following what was stated on the medicinal formula. There was not the slightest mistake. However, a problem still occurred. Clearly, there was something that had yet to be controlled by him while following these footsteps.</p>
 <p>The earlier Xiao Yan was also similarly unaware of the step he had deviated from. However, he came to a sudden understanding the instant the flame surged in both his eyes. The problem did not originate from the medicinal powder nor medicinal liquid he had refined. Instead, it had come from the drop of green-red blood.</p>
 <p>This drop of green-red blood was refined from the Demon Beast’s dried corpse. The wild, violent energy contained within it had far exceeded the requirement it fulfilled for the refinement of the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill. Just the strength of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma, Bone Spirit Fruit, and Mysterious Sky Green Vine had difficulty completing the neutralization. In other words, it meant that the blood’s strength was too strong and the medicinal ingredients’ strength was too weak. The two had difficulty reaching an equilibrium...</p>
 <p>The tight frown on Xiao Yan’s face did not relax after he understood the source of the problem. At this moment, if he failed to neutralize the blood strength, he would only be able to use another rank 7 Magical Beasts blood. However, Xiao Yan had not prepared any other essence blood other than the green-red blood… thus, he could only choose the former option.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind also became focused as this thought flashed through his heart. He waved his hand and the many light clusters that were pausing in the air were absorbed by him into the medicinal cauldron. The jade-green flame swept over them and within a couple of minutes, those medicinal ingredients slowly merged into a pale-blue liquid under Xiao Yan’s precise control.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the blue-colored liquid that contained a gentle strength. He directed it with his hand as it slowly descended. It landed on the green-red liquid, which surface was churning with increasing intensity.</p>
 <p>After this drop of liquid, that contained numerous medicinal ingredient’s essence strengths, fell into the green-red liquid, the gentle strength contained within it had an immediate effect. The surface of the liquid blood swiftly shrank into a long narrow thorn that slowly disappeared back into the liquid.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he saw this scene. However, the breath had just exited his throat when he suddenly stiffened. He had clearly sensed a pressurizing feeling slowly spread from the green-red blood…</p>
 <p>The appearance of this pressurizing feeling caused the Dou Qi within Xiao Yan’s body to be sluggish. The green-red liquid, that had just calmed down, appeared to be boiling as it wildly surged. A wild and violent strength that caused one’s expression to change swiftly rose within it.</p>
 <p>The sudden unexpected change that had occurred also caused the expressions of everyone present to change. This pressure that had spread out from the blood caused even Su Qian’s group to feel an instantaneous shock.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“There’s a problem with the green-red blood that Xiao Yan had taken out… just what kind of Magical Beast did this essence blood come from? Even some ordinary rank 7 Magical Beasts would not be able to unleash such a powerful pressure.”</p>
 <p>The many Elders in the sky revealed shocked faces as they looked to the rock platform. After which, all of them began to engage in private whispers.</p>
 <p>Su Qian and the Little Fairy Doctor exchanged looks. A solemn expression flashed across their eyes. Looking at this pressure, it seemed that the owner of this essence blood definitely possessed an extremely terrifying strength when it was still alive. It might even be a rank 8 peerless beast. Just where did Xiao Yan get his hands on such a high ranked Magical Beast’s blood?</p>
 <p>While everyone was stunned, no one realized that Zi Yan’s gem-like eyes, who was standing beside the Little Fairy Doctor, had started to release a strange purple glow when the pressure had appeared.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xiao Yan’s gaze was firmly locked on green-red blood. The biggest problem had indeed originated from this…</p>
 <p>“According to what Mo Tian Xing had mentioned back then, the strength of this Magical Beast when it was alive should be around the peak of rank 7 and was about to breakthrough to rank 8. Even a Magical Beast of this rank would have difficulty emitting such a powerful pressure from just a drop of essence blood. It seemed like… this Magical Beast’s background is really somewhat extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>A glow flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes. The pressure that was emitted from the green-red blood repeatedly destroyed the equilibrium of the many medicinal ingredients. It seemed that there was a remnant arrogant instinct present within the blood, an instinct that originated from its bloodline. This arrogant instinct did not allow it to be refined into a medicinal pill that a person could absorb!</p>
 <p>“Regardless of how strong you were when you were alive, you are merely just a drop of blood now. I don’t believe that I cannot subdue you!”</p>
 <p>A thread of anger had risen within Xiao Yan’s heart because of the resistance being emitted by the blood. He let out a cold snort and flicked his finger. A Dragon Blood Ganoderma once again appeared in his hand. A flame swiftly churned and rose on his hand and swallowed the Dragon Blood Ganoderma. After which, an unceasing number of medicinal ingredients also flew out from his storage ring and were thrown into the flame.</p>
 <p>The resistance of this drop of blood had far exceeded Xiao Yan’s expectations. However, from this, he could tell just how vast and mighty the energy contained within it was. If he could successfully refine the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill this time around, it was likely that the pill would be of a very high quality.</p>
 <p>This Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill was something that Xiao Yan was refining for Medusa. If the interior of her body was really as they thought, he might be refining it for his son or daughter. Xiao Yan always sought the best in everything he did. Since he wanted to refine the pill, he would naturally refine the best one!</p>
 <p>While the thoughts in Xiao Yan’s heart churned, a drop of a blood-red-colored liquid surfaced within the flame on Xiao Yan’s palm.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe that I cannot subdue you!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth as he looked at the blood-red liquid. He flicked his finger and the liquid transformed into a red figure that was thrown into the green-red blood.</p>
 <p>The wild, violent strength of the green-red blood weakened the moment the blood-red-colored medicinal liquid was thrown in. However, the pressure began to rise again immediately. Moreover, it seemed that the pressure, seeping out of the blood, was becoming stronger and stronger because of Xiao Yan’s repeated offenses. In the end, Xiao Yan’s sight had become somewhat dim. He could vaguely see an extremely savage, enormous beast head pouncing out of the medicinal cauldron as it violently came toward him.</p>
 <p>The illusionary beast head did not appear, but Xiao Yan’s throat still emitted a low muffled groan. He was somewhat shocked to realize that his Spiritual Strength had suddenly shown signs of weakening…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. The shock within his eyes had become denser. He also rejoiced a little amid this shock. It was fortunate that he did not recklessly swallow this blood. Otherwise, would his body not end up being turned into chaos by this thing?</p>
 <p>The refinement of the medicinal pill had also been interrupted by this damn blood. If he were unable to expel the pressure from within it, he would never be able to successfully refine this medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>Everyone looking at the solemn expression on Xiao Yan’s face on the rock platform knew that an extremely great trouble seemed to have appeared.</p>
 <p>“I wonder where big brother Xiao got his hands on this Magical Beast essence blood. It actually contains such a pressure. According to what I know, every single tribe member in some of those powerful Magical Beast Tribes in the Central Plains possesses a spiritual tablet. There is a thread of remnant spirit within the spiritual tablet. As long as this thread of remnant spirit is not scattered, the blood within its body will not be obtained by anyone else… it is quite similar to this scene. However, this is the ‘Black-Corner Region.’ How could a Magical Beast possessing a Spiritual Tablet appear here?” Xin Lan’s eyebrows were vertical. She stood on the pavilion and muttered somewhat doubtfully in her heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was naturally unaware whether or not this damn Magical Beast was some member of a powerful tribe in the Central Plains. The current him had already been placed in a terrible fix by the green-red blood.</p>
 <p>A purple glow once again flashed across the pupils of Zi Yan in the distance while Xiao Yan was feeling a headache. Her body immediately moved and rushed toward the rock platform. Her lovely body penetrated through the spatial lock and appeared above the rock platform.</p>
 <p>“Girl, now, I don’t have time to help you refine Danwan to eat…” Xiao Yan waved his hand and helplessly spoke when he saw Zi Yan barge in.</p>
 <p>“You will never be able to expel that pressure by using medicinal things because this kind of pressure originates from the bloodline. Although I am not certain just what kind of Magical Beast this fellow is, its background is definitely extraordinary. It might even be some ancient beast’s descendant.” Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Xiao Yan and crisply replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was also startled when he heard this. He bitterly laughed. Currently, he really did not wish to think about whether or not the owner of this blood was a unique beast of ancient times. He only knew that if he did not remove the thread of pressure within the blood, the medicinal ingredients that he had found with much difficulty would be wasted for naught.</p>
 <p>“Use my blood…” Zi Yan’s eyes stared intently at the drop of green-red blood within the medicinal cauldron. The purple glow in her eyes also became more and more dense. She immediately bit the tip of her tongue without waiting for Xiao Yan’s reply. A drop of blood that contained a thread of purpleness slowly drifted out and landed in front of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was stunned as he studied this drop of blood, that contained a purple luster. He asked, “Your blood can expel the pressure within the blood?”</p>
 <p>“Although I am not aware just what kind of Magical Beast it is, my instincts tells me that my blood is even stronger than it!”Zi Yan proudly lifted her chin and snorted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan doubtfully looked at this proud little fellow. He mused for a moment before sighing out loud. With the current situation, he could only try everything even if it was impossible. If this failed, he would have to push this pill refinement back.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan beckoned with his finger as this thought flashed across his heart. This drop of blood in front of him that contained a purpleness flew into the medicinal cauldron. After which, it landed in the green-red blood and began to swiftly merge with it at a pace visible to the naked eye…</p>
 <p>With the entrance of this drop of blood, an instantaneous silence seemed to have appeared. Xiao Yan was stunned to discover that the powerful pressure that had been spreading out from the green-red blood swiftly scattered like snow meeting some boiling water…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was stunned as he looked at the change within the medicinal cauldron. Due to his Spiritual Strength covering the entire interior, Xiao Yan could clearly sense that there was the faint feeling of being terrified like having met one’s nemesis…</p>
 <p>Within a couple of breaths, that pressure that had given Xiao Yan an incomparable headache had completely disappeared. This kind of transformation caused him to duly look at Zi Yan, whose small face was filled with a proud expression. His heart was filled with uncertainty and curiosity. Just what exactly was this girl’s actual form?</p>
