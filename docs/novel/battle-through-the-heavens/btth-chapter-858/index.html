 <p><strong><u>Chapter 858: Spiritual Avatar</u></strong></p>
 <p>Under the probing of Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Perception, he could see that under the gray robe, there was the absence of the raging Dou Qi that formed like the others. Instead, it was covered by an illusory aura. This kind of aura was not foreign to Xiao Yan because it was Spiritual Strength!</p>
 <p>In other words, the Old Ying Shan in the mountain forest below was not his actual body. Instead, it was an avatar agglomerated from his soul!</p>
 <p>“No wonder this old fellow would leave the city in such a high profile manner. It was actually a fake spiritual body. Now, the actual Old Ying Shan might have long since taken the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva and left the Black Emperor City.” This thought rushed through Xiao Yan’s heart in a lightning-like manner. His expression gradually turned dark and solemn. Everyone here seemed to have been played by this old fellow.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan did not know how Old Ying Shan was actually able to use his spirit to form such a powerful fake body, a fake was ultimately a fake. Under the probing of Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Perception, the latter had already been completely exposed to Xiao Yan’s eyes. However… it was a little too late now. With that old fellow’s speed, this short while gave him enough time to flee to a remote mountain forest in the ‘Black-Corner Region’. Given Old Ying Shan’s strength, if he were to hide his aura, it was likely that even an elite Dou Zun would not be able to find him in the vast mountains.</p>
 <p>“What is it? What have you discovered?” Xiao Yan’s gloomy expression was swiftly sensed by Su Qian, the Little Fairy Doctor, and the others beside him. All of them immediately asked in a soft surprised whisper.</p>
 <p>“The Old Ying Shan below is a fake. The Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is also not with him.” Xiao Yan slowly exhaled and explained with a gloomy expression.</p>
 <p>These words of Xiao Yan was undoubtedly like thunder that shook everyone until they became stunned. It was a long while later before Su Qian took the lead in recovering. He frowned and said, “A fake? Why is his aura so similar?”</p>
 <p>“This should be something created by Old Ying Shan’s spirit. We have underestimated his tactics. This unusual spiritual avatar is something that I have only seen for the first time. Other than my teacher, I’m afraid that he is the best person I have met who can manipulate his Spiritual Strength until such an extent.” Xiao Yan slowly replied. His eyes coldly stared at ‘Old Ying Shan,’ who did not appear to panic despite being surrounded and attacked by so many people below.</p>
 <p>Using one’s spirit to create an avatar. This kind of unique method to use Spiritual Strength was something that Xiao Yan had never seen. He had also never seen Yao Lao display this. Despite this, he was naturally aware that Yao Lao definitely far surpassed Old Ying Shan when it came to the use of Spiritual Strength. After all, the renowned name of Yao zun-zhe (respectful name for a Dou Zun) did not come from nowhere.</p>
 <p>Dou Zun. That was a level that was even further and more frightening than a Dou Zong. At that level, one was already a top person on the continent. Their methods were far from what an elite Dou Zong could compare with.</p>
 <p>“Spiritual avatar?” Su Qian and thr Little Fairy Doctor were stunned when they heard Xiao Yan’s words. Although they were also elite Dou Zongs, the two of them admitted that they could not agglomerate their spirit into an avatar and allow it to possess quite a great amount of genuine strength. It was unexpected that Old Ying Shan was actually able to reach such a level.</p>
 <p>“What should we do now? Since this is a fake, it is likely that the real Old Ying Shan would have left long ago.” Xiao Li knit his brows and softly cursed, “This old fellow is really crafty. He actually possessed such a tactic.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly shut his eyes. His Spiritual Perception once again surged out. However, this time around, it did not rush toward Old Ying Shan. Instead, it lingered over the sky and repeatedly scanned to and fro.</p>
 <p>Although using Spiritual Strength to agglomerate an avatar might enable the avatar to possess the aura of the original body and some of its strength, there would still be a slight connection regardless of how far apart the avatar and the actual body were. Although this connection was extremely faint and thin, it did still exist. If he found a thread of this invisible connection, he might be able to find out where the actual body of Old Ying Shan was.</p>
 <p>Powerful Spiritual Strengths crossed each other in the sky, forming an invisible spiritual net which carefully swept to and fro…</p>
 <p>Normally, experts who specialized in training Dou Qi did not attach much importance to Spiritual Strength. Hence, on the whole, the people who possessed strong Spiritual Strengths on the Dou Qi continent were alchemists. This was because Spiritual Perception was something that was necessary to refind pills. The sharpness of one’s Spiritual Perception was determined by the strength of one’s Spiritual Strength. Being an outstanding person among these people, Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength was something that even Yao Lao could not stop praising. Hence, it was not impossible to rely on the strength of his Spiritual Strength to search Old Ying Shan’s spiritual connection.</p>
 <p>Su Qian and the others ceased their conversations when they saw Xiao Yan shut his eyes. They could vaguely sense an invisible strength be emitted from Xiao Yan’s body. It quietly spread through the sky like waves of water…</p>
 <p>The bloody mess in the mountain forest continued. Perhaps it was because of the yells of death that resounded over the place, but some factions, that had originally remained still, were unable to contain their eagerness anymore. During this period of time, there were even quite a number of experts who joined hands to approach Old Ying Shan’s body. However, they still ended up seriously wounded by the latter and were forced to retreat after spitting out blood.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly shut, suddenly opened them while Old Ying Shan and the few experts collided. Immediately, his eyes turned to the eastern direction. A vague spiritual fluctuation was transmitted from that area earlier…</p>
 <p>“Have you found it?” After looking in the direction Xiao Yan was staring in, Su Qian’s heart tightened as he hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“I have sensed something. That fellow is actually still nearby?” Joy surged onto Xiao Yan’s face. His eyes immediately swept over the spiritual avatar of Old Ying Shan in the forest. He decisively said, “The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan, follow me. First Elder, all of you should keep watch over this place. I will leave some signs along the way. If you personally see this spiritual avatar disappear, you should immediately hurry over.”</p>
 <p>“Just the three of you?” Su Qian frowned and asked after hearing his orders.</p>
 <p>“Currently, no one knows just what kind of relationship this spiritual avatar and Old Ying Shan have with each other. Therefore, it is best if we are a little more cautious. It should be sufficient with just the Little Fairy Doctor and me on that side.” Xiao Yan smiled. He beckoned to the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan with his hand and did not remain any longer. Jade-green fire wings swiftly extended from his back. His body moved and rushed to the sky. He headed to the east where the spiritual fluctuation had originated from. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p>
 <p>Su Qian’s group sighed in relief when their gazes looked at the backs of Xiao Yan’s group. From Xiao Yan’s manner, it appeared that he had found some clues. As long as Old Ying Shan had not fled, there was still quite a great chance to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.</p>
 <p>“Now, we will see just what kind of tactics this old fellow is playing…”</p>
 <p>Su Qian smiled slightly. His gaze slowly turned to the spiritual body of Old Ying Shan, which was surrounded, before whispering.</p>
 <p>While the spot where Su Qian’s group was located had erupted into a bloody big battle, an isolated col that was located on the eastern side of the Black Emperor City was filled with a silence.</p>
 <p>A gray-haired old man was seated with his legs crossed within the col. His eyes were tightly shut as a powerful Spiritual Strength wrapped around his body. His shriveled tree-like fingers flickered in a flower-like manner in front of him. Following each change of his ten fingers, the powerful Spiritual Strength that spread over his body would emit waves of fluctuations.</p>
 <p>The alteration continued for around ten minutes before the gray-haired old man slowly opened his eyes. A cold smile was revealed on his face. However, his expression suddenly changed when he was just about to get up. His gaze shot toward a spot outside of the col in a lightning-like manner as he coldly cried out, “Who is it?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, Old Ying Shan really lives up to his reputation. You are actually able to create a spiritual avatar. This really surprises the old me…”</p>
 <p>When the gray-haired old man’s voice sounded, one could see over ten figures slowly surfacing outside of the col. One of them was surprisingly the sect leader of the Black Emperor Sect, Mo Tian Xing. Qi Shan and Mo Ya also following close behind him.</p>
 <p>“Mo Tian Xing!”</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan’s eyes immediately shrank a little as he looked at the human figures who had appeared. His voice was dark and cold as he asked, “What is sect leader Mo planning to do? Don’t tell me that you wish to destroy the Black Emperor Sect’s reputation?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, old demon Ying, you can forget about frightening me. What can one’s reputation do in the ‘Black-Corner Region’? The people from the ‘Black-Corner Region’ do not buy this.” Mo Tian Xing smiled and laughed.</p>
 <p>“How did you find me?” Old Ying Shan’s expression slightly sank. He suddenly seemed to have thought of something and his eyes became densely cold. “You have done something to the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?”</p>
 <p>“It is but just a little Dou Qi imprint.” Mo Tian Xing faintly laughed. “Old demon Ying, don’t delay for any more time. After using your spiritual avatar, your actual strength will have greatly diminished. With your current condition, you are no match for this ancestor (Dou Zong). Therefore, hand over the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to me.”</p>
 <p>“You will let the old me leave if I hand it over to you?” Old Ying Shan replied with a cold smile.</p>
 <p>Mo Tian Xing smiled and shook his head. He said, “Impossible. However, I can invite you to be a long term guest at my Black Emperor Sect.”</p>
 <p>The corner of Old Ying Shan’s mouth slightly twitched when he heard this. A savageness immediately surfaced in his eyes as he ferociously laughed, “Mo Tian Xing, even the condition of this old me is not at its peak, you are really thinking simply if you want to snatch the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from my hands!”</p>
 <p>A majestic aura suddenly surged out from Old Ying Shan’s body after his words sounded. Under the pressure of this majestic aura, the members of the Black Emperor Sect present, with the exception of Mo Tian Xing, took a couple of hurried steps back. Only then did they stabilize their bodies.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I will give it a try.” A dense coldness also surfaced on the corner of Mo Tian Xing’s mouth. He waved his sleeves and a majestic aura that did not lose to Old Ying Shan’s surged out like floodwater!</p>
 <p>Two monstrous auras spread and collided within this small col. The spatial ripple that they created shook the col until it began to tremble. Numerous crack lines as thick as one’s arm slowly climbed to the mountain peaks.</p>
 <p>The two conflicting auras created a tense atmosphere of swords being drawn within the col. Just as a soul-stirring battle was about to erupt, a clear laugh suddenly resounded over the sky.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, it is unexpected that the real show is actually here. I nearly missed it.”</p>
