 <p><strong><u>Chapter 552: The Violent Activity Within the Tower</u></strong></p>
 <p>The door was pushed opened. Immediately, a pale-red powerful light suddenly surged out, causing Xiao Yan to shut his eyes as a reflex. He only slowly opened them a long while later and eyed the scene in the room. The amazement on his face grew even denser.</p>
 <p>The spacious interior of the training room had basically been covered by a layer of thick pale-red fog. One could merely see a spot two to three meters in front of him. Wherever one’s gaze was directed to the area ahead was covered by that rich dense pale-redness.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face carried amazement as he stepped into the training room. His hand grabbed at the drifting pale-red fog in an illusionary manner. Immediately, a warm feeling was transmitted from his hand. A thread of pale-red fog moved along his opened pores and entered Xiao Yan’s body, turning into threads of pure energy that automatically flowed within his veins.</p>
 <p>“What powerful energy!” Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes. He inhaled a deep breath of cold air. It was a long while later before he finally spoke in a soft voice. The degree of richness of the energy present in this place was at least more than ten times greater than that of a high grade training room in the fifth level! Xiao Yan did not have the slightest doubt that he would truly be able to feel a flying feeling if he trained here.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, of course. Otherwise, those fellows would not look at this place with such envious eyes.” Zi Yan arrogantly raised her small chest behind him as she spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded joyfully. He slowly stepped into the room and his body passed through the pale-red fog. A moment later, he saw a pale-black rock platform, that was similar to the other training rooms, in the middle of this training room. In front of the rock platform was a small notch. It appeared that training in this place similarly required the deduction of ‘Fire Energy’.</p>
 <p>“This is the training place. You have your own ‘Fire Crystal Card’, right? Oh that’s right, I forgot to tell you. This no. 1 training room may be better than the other training rooms, but it also requires quite a lot of ‘Fire Energy’. It appears that training here for one day requires the deduction of 30 days of ‘Fire Energy’.” Zi Yan swung her ponytail as she revealed two canine teeth while she spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>“30 days of ‘Fire Energy’...” Such a huge training fee was something that caused even the wealthy and confident Xiao Yan to involuntarily exhale cold air from between his teeth. If one was to count in this manner, it appeared that one would nearly require a 1000 days of ‘Fire Energy’ in order to train here for one month? Heavens… Xiao Yan would definitely not be able to train here were it not for him relying on the sale of medicinal pills to earn ‘Fire Energy’ even if he was beaten to death given such a great ‘Fire Energy’ deduction burden. This amount of ‘Fire Energy’ was something that most ordinary students would not be able to spend in an entire year.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me that you don’t have ‘Fire Energy’. I have no other solution if that is the case.” Zi Yan hurriedly spoke when she saw Xiao Yan’s manner. She did not know of any methods to earn ‘Fire Energy’. Therefore, she could only use the ‘Fire Energy’ that she obtained from the Inner Academy every month to maintain her training. Even though the first on the ‘Strong Ranking’ was able to obtain quite a lot of ‘Fire Energy’ every month, it was merely just sufficient for her to train in this place. She did not have any method if she was asked to sponsor someone else.</p>
 <p>“You need not worry about this.” Xiao Yan shook his head helplessly. After which, he slowly sat down cross-legged and spoke to Zi Yan, “After this, I will begin to train. You should not come and disturb me during this training period. If you want to look for me to refine Danwan, you can wait at the side for me to wake up. You must not suddenly wake me from my training condition. Otherwise… you can continue to eat those raw medicinal ingredients in the future.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s threat clearly had an extremely great effect on Zi Yan. Therefore, the latter’s head immediately nodded like a chicken feeding on grains. That manner was such that she had nearly raised her hand to swear.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan relaxed and smiled when he saw this action of Zi Yan. He took out a ‘Fire Crystal Card’ from his storage ring and gently inserted it into the notch. After which, his hands immediately began to slowly form the training seal while his eyes were shut quietly...</p>
 <p>Zi Yan tooted with her mouth when she saw Xiao Yan entered into his training state. She threw Xiao Yan a grimace before walking out of the training room in an extremely displeased manner. After which, she flipped her hand and closed the door.</p>
 <p>The ‘Fire Energy’ that the no. 1 training room deducted may be called a sky-high price, but it must be said that its effects could indeed match this kind of sky-high price. This was the thought that appeared in Xiao Yan’s heart when he saw the cluster of extremely rich ‘Heart Flame’ that appeared within his body.</p>
 <p>The ‘Heart Flame’ formed while training on the top few levels could be called a thread or a wisp. The ‘Heart Flame’ in this no. 1 training room had appeared in the form of cluster after cluster. Moreover, the heat within was also a couple of times stronger than the former. Under this kind of powerful ‘Heart Flame’, the speed at which Dou Qi was being refined was so quick that even Xiao Yan was quietly speechless.</p>
 <p>A large cluster of invisible ‘Heart Flame’ curled and rose near his heart. Wave after wave of powerful Dou Qi unceasingly followed the Qi Paths and circulated. After which, it was poured in… following the appearance of this Dou Qi once again, it had already become a line that was as thick as a thumb and appeared crystal clear, much like an emerald-colored crystal line.</p>
 <p>Although the rate of increase of his Dou Qi had increased more than ten times under the refinement of this powerful invisible ‘Heart Flame’, the Qi Paths in Xiao Yan’s body frequently emitted waves of piercing pain due to the hot temperature. Moreover, this was the result after Xiao Yan’s body had already undergone strengthening by the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’. If it had been his body before it had been strengthened, given Xiao Yan’s current strength such a ferocious ‘Heart Flame’ would likely cause the interior of his body to roll about in an overwhelming manner the moment it appeared.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was extremely unwell due to the feeling of piercing pain, it did not delay him by even a little. The thought of his mind still pushed the Dou Qi to repeatedly surge out from the sea urchin Dou Crystal that had seven long thorns.</p>
 <p>Currently, the urchin Dou Crystal in his body had been reduced from the initial nine long thorns to seven of them. After becoming familiar with the Dou Ling class during this period of time, Xiao Yan slightly understood some of its secrets. It appeared that each time his strength advanced once, a long energy thorn would shrink back into the sea urchin Dou Crystal. According to this guess, it was likely that Xiao Yan would be truly able to reach the Dou Wang class when he had absorbed all of the seven remaining energy thorns into that sea urchin Dou Crystal!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan felt extremely astounded by this special measurement method of the Dou Ling class. This had caused him to have a clearer understanding of his own strength. This was undoubtedly much clearer than the vague feeling of the Da Dou Shi class.</p>
 <p>With the help of that wild and violent ‘Heart Flame’ from the no. 1 training room, Xiao Yan was able to vaguely sense that the seventh long energy thorn within his sea urchin Dou Crystal was gradually becoming shorter at an extremely slow speed. The moment it completely shrank into the Dou Crystal, it would represent that Xiao Yan had reached the three star Dou Ling level.</p>
 <p>There was no sense of time when one was training. This was especially in such cases when one could clearly sense the Dou Qi in one’s body becoming more powerful and purer by the day. One would not have the slightest feeling of time that was flowing by in the outside world.</p>
 <p>A full five days had passed since Xiao Yan had entered the no. 1 training room. Zi Yan had come once during the five days. She waited for a long time when she saw Xiao Yan’s training condition. Until the end, she did not dare to forcefully wake Xiao Yan up. She was really afraid that Xiao Yan would cease refining Danwans for her in his anger. In that case, it was likely that she would have to return to the miserable life of eating raw medicinal ingredients.</p>
 <p>The benefits that these five days had toward Xiao Yan were naturally something that one would know even without saying. Not only did his aura become increasingly dense, but the Dou Qi in his body had also become much more polished. The seventh energy thorn on the sea urchin Dou Crystal had already shrunk by nearly half. From this, it was sufficient to see the achievement of Xiao Yan’s training during these five days. If he was placed in a normal situation, it was likely that Xiao Yan would not have such an effect even if he trained for a full month.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan finally withdrew from his training condition after training to the seventh day. Coincidentally, he met Zi Yan who had been waiting in this place for half a day. He began to smile somewhat embarrassed when he saw the unhappy manner of the little girl before hurryingly to receive the medicinal ingredients from her hand. He immediately helped her refine a batch of Danwan. Only then did Zi Yan’s expression became slightly better.</p>
 <p>The seven days of training were enough to catch up with nearly a month of training. The powerful flood like surging waves of Dou Qi within his body caused Xiao Yan’s entire body to be filled with the feeling of strength. This no. 1 training room was indeed far from what an ordinary training room could compare with.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan finished refining Zi Yan’s Danwan before eating some simple things. He got up and moved his bones a little, but did not have the intention of exiting the room. He rested in this manner for over an hour before he once again returned to the rock platform, sat cross-legged and trained under Zi Yan’s eyes, which appeared to be a gaze that one used when looking at an insane person.</p>
 <p>“You lunatic. Who trains in this manner…” Zi Yan muttered before helplessly shaking her head. She could only exit the training room once again.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s plan when entering the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ was to undertake a retreat all the way until the start of the ‘Strong Ranking’. He was pressed for time and naturally did not dare to neglect his training. If everything was normal, he would be able to train until the time as he wanted to. However, just as Xiao Yan’s training retreat reached its fifteenth day, a special unexpected occurrence appeared in the calm ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’...</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was quiet in the no. 1 training room. Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged in the middle. Threads of pale-red fog were unceasingly pouring into Xiao Yan’s body as they followed his breathing. Eventually, they transformed into rich energy that flowed within his Qi Paths.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A somewhat low and muffled sound suddenly sounded within the training room. Following the emission of the muffled sound, it appeared that the entire training room trembled gently. Quickly following this, the originally calm energy within the training room suddenly rolled intensely like boiling water.</p>
 <p>It was naturally impossible for Xiao Yan to continue to maintain his training condition given this activity. His tightly shut eyes abruptly opened as his face looked at the activity within the training room in a shocked manner. A moment later, his expression changed abruptly as he let out a shocked involuntarily cry, “Why has the energy within the interior of the tower become so much more wild and violent?”</p>
 <p>“All students within the tower. Leave the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower’ within the next ten minutes!”</p>
 <p>An elderly voice suddenly reverberated throughout the interior of the entire tower while Xiao Yan was shocked. Finally, it rested beside everyone’s ears and did not disappear for a long while.</p>
 <p>“Something has happened within the tower…” A thought swiftly flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart at this instance.</p>
