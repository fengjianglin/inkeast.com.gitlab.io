 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1343: Bitter Training</u></strong></p>
 <p>Fluorescent lights drifted above the foggy land. At a glance, it appeared like the entire world was covered in a deadly silence. There was not even the slightest life force present…</p>
 <p>This dead silence remained for an unknown period of time. Suddenly, the low and deep sound of rushing wind appeared. A low cry was mixed within it. The sound followed the fog and penetrated through it. If one’s eyes were to follow the direction where the sound originated, one would be able to see two blurry figures…</p>
 <p>Only upon closer inspection one would discover ten illusory figures around the two people. These figures had empty eye sockets floating around. Despite the absence of eyes, the speed and strength of these energy figures was not weakened even a little. A majestic energy surged when they attacked. Some of the large rocks on the ground were shattered.</p>
 <p>“Hee, attack!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed as he watched the energy bodies surrounding him. After which, he let out a loud cry.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure rushed away almost instantly after his loud cry sounded. At the same time, a lovely figure also flashed and appeared from another spot beside Xiao Yan. A golden light was unleashed from her hand, and it smashed into the many energy bodies with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>A deep explosion spread over the area. Even the dense fog had become much thinner.</p>
 <p>This kind of explosion continued for a moment before it swiftly came to a stop. Two figures once again appeared together. They exchanged looks and laughed.</p>
 <p>“Five pieces…” Xiao Yan opened his palm. Five thumb-sized energy cores appeared in it. They emitted a dense energy.</p>
 <p>“Six pieces…” Xun Er also extended her white-jade-like hand. Six similar energy cores appeared in her palm. Xun Er covered her mouth and softly laughed when she saw the difference. She said in a lovely voice, “Xiao Yan ge-ge, I have won again this time around…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. Although the strength of these energy bodies was at the two star Dou Zun class, dealing with five of them at the same time was already his limit. If there were any more of them, he would have to use a Dou Skill. If they continued to compete like this, he was unable to match Xun Er.</p>
 <p>“Absorb the energy cores first. I will stand guard.” Xun Er placed all of the energy cores in Xiao Yan’s hand as she ordered him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan took the energy cores into his hand without rejecting her. He was aware that he was extremely pressed to raise his strength. Hence, he did not utter any pointless rejections. He received the energy cores and swiftly sat down. His Qi Method was circulated and wave after wave of rich energy surged from the energy core. It appeared like a thick fog that wrapped around Xiao Yan and poured into his body like an air dragon, following his breathing.</p>
 <p>Xun Er smiled when she saw Xiao Yan absorb the energy. She gently sat beside Xiao Yan, and her hand parted the black hair in front of her forehead. It had been nearly two months since they had entered the Heavenly Tomb. During these two months, the two of them had continued to walk through this vast land. Any energy bodies that they meet along the way would be turned into energy cores and would appear in their hands. Hence, the gains that they had obtained during these two months were quite rich, but they felt somewhat regretful since the energy bodies were not very strong. The energy cores that they had obtained only appeared to be of the second grade or third grade. These energy cores were still a little useful. When Xiao Yan absorbed more and more energy cores, their effects seemed to become a little poorer. Only now did he understand that if one absorbed too much of this energy, one’s body would form a resistance to it. However, this resistance was much weaker than what was formed against a medicinal pill.</p>
 <p>This quiet world was extremely beneficial to train in. However, one would have to endure a dullness that was many times greater than the outside world. Fortunately, Xiao Yan and Xun Er were accompanying each other, so the days might appear dull, but there was an additional liveliness.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s absorption of the energy core did not last for long before his eyes slowly opened. He inhaled a deep breath of air, and the energy lingering around him turned into a cluster of air that was swallowed into his stomach.</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Xun Er stretched her lazy waist after watching Xiao Yan complete the absorption. Her pretty curves were completely exposed, and her tone contained a tempting laziness.</p>
 <p>“There has been an improvement. However, I am still aways from the six star level. It seems that we must find some higher grade energy cores.” Xiao Yan frowned as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, we are already approaching the middle section of the first level. The energy bodies from here on will gradually become stronger. If we are lucky, we might even be able to meet an energy body with the strength of a six star Dou Zun or higher. The energy cores within their bodies are most suitable to you.” Xun Er sweetly smiled as she explained the situation. Her enchanting smile caused the irritation that had appeared within Xiao Yan’s body to quietly disappear.</p>
 <p>“How far is it to the second level?”</p>
 <p>“It should take another month or so. The Heavenly Tomb has three levels. The first level is the most spacious. The subsequent two levels are a little better. However, the danger will also increase.” Xun Er replied.</p>
 <p>“There is still another month, huh…” Xiao Yan mused. He nodded and stood up. He looked to the horizon and smiled as he said, “In that case, let’s continue to travel. I wonder what those other fellows are like now.”</p>
 <p>“Those who can enter the Heavenly Tomb are all very strong individuals within the clan. They also understand the Heavenly Tomb quite well. Unless they end up provoking an extremely powerful existence, nothing should happen to them. Moreover, an existence that has reached that level will rarely be found on the first level.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. After which, he waved his large hand, took a step forward, and quickly headed in the direction of the deepest part of the Heavenly Tomb. Xun Er smiled and followed close behind him. Although this world was dull, any dull place would become extremely warm when she could be with him…</p>
 <p>The vast Heavenly Tomb was filled with a dense energy fog. Under this energy pressure, anything that flew would feel their bodies grow as heavy as a mountain. One would feel extremely exhausted after flying for a short period of time. Thus, the Heavenly Tomb appeared endless…</p>
 <p>The world in the Heavenly Tomb was dead quiet and uninteresting. However, no mediocre person could enter this mysterious place. The people who could enter stood out from the many geniuses within their clans. Not only did they possess powerful strengths, even their characters were quite clam. Although this dullness was a little abominable to them, it was still within their ability to endure.</p>
 <p>Under this kind of dullness, it appeared that the concept of time had become much weaker. Hence, Xiao Yan and Xun Er could not help but feel a little stunned when they saw an energy wall on the edge of their sights after they had spent four months crossing the vast Heavenly Tomb.</p>
 <p>“Is this the entrance to the second level?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan asked in a slightly surprised voice after seeing the energy light wall, which seemed to pour down from the edge of the sky.</p>
 <p>A travel-worn feeling spread from Xiao Yan. His black hair had become a little longer, and his face seemed to have become a little thinner. However, his dark-black eyes contained a glint of flickering light.</p>
 <p>Ever since Xiao Yan and Xun Er had entered the deepest parts of the first level, they have had to face the attacks of some powerful energy bodies. Xiao Yan was the one who had dealt with most of these attacks because Xiao Yan could only stop Xun Er from intervening after seeing her destroy a six star Dou Zun energy body in a swift and simple manner. The first level did not pose much of a threat to her, and it would not have much of an effect on her training. However, it was different for Xiao Yan. He was only a five star Dou Zun. If he did not use any Dou Skills, he would obtain benefits from exchanging blows with those six star Dou Zun energy bodies…</p>
 <p>Of course, this was temporary. After the number of times they fought increased, Xiao Yan had become familiar with these energy bodies. Hence, the time of the fight had been reduced from a dozen plus exchanges to less than ten exchanges. Some of the weaker six star energy bodies were dealt with by Xiao Yan within three exchanges.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan ge-ge, you are currently at the peak of the fifth star and will breakthrough to the sixth star level soon. I suggest you breakthrough before entering the second level. Otherwise, the Dou Qi within your body will not be stable if it is full. Moreover, the second level is more dangerous than the first. One cannot guarantee that nothing will happen if one advances one’s level there…” Xun Er looked at the enormous energy light curtain in the distance before turning her head. She smiled as she gave Xiao Yan a suggestion.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment after hearing her words. Finally, he nodded. After having trained for four months within the Heavenly Tomb and having swallowed thousands of energy cores, the Dou Qi within his body was at a full state. He would be able to breakthrough to the sixth star at any moment. However, one’s aura would end up unstable when advancing one’s level, and it would not be suitable to stay in such a place.</p>
 <p>“The advancement between levels in the Dou Zun class requires too much energy. The energy that I have absorbed during these four months is something that I would not have been able to obtain in the outside world even after an entire year. This energy has barely reached the requirement to breakthrough. I wonder just what kind of frightening energy one requires to breakthrough the sixth star to the seventh star…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly sighed in his heart. He swiftly focused his mind, turned his head to Xun Er, and said, “In that case, I will have to ask you to guard me again…”</p>
 <p>Xun Er smiled and nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan swept his eyes around him when he saw her nod. His body leaped onto a large rock. After which, he swiftly sat down. He entered his training condition and a cluster Dou Qi began to gradually spread from his body. It covered the area within a hundred meter radius…</p>
 <p>After Xiao Yan shut his eyes and attempted to breakthrough, Xun Er’s toes pressed against the ground. Her body drifted onto a large rock. Her eyes were shut and the activity within a thousand-foot-radius was captured within her heart.</p>
 <p>Following the silence of these two, the land once again became completely quiet…</p>
 <p>After this dead silence continued for around two hours, a dark and cold wind suddenly rushed over…</p>
 <p>Xun Er on the large rock suddenly opened her eyes when this dark and cold wind appear. Her face was ice-cold as she looked t the sky in the north. She spoke in an indifferent voice, “Since you are here, why do you need to continue hiding? Have the current members of the Hun clan become this terrible?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, your are worthy of being in possession of the divine bloodline of the Gu clan. Such perception is indeed praiseworthy…”</p>
 <p>The space in the distance fluctuated after Xun Er’s cold voice sounded. Immediately, two black robed figures slowly stepped in the air and arrive. A dark and dense aura slowly spread from them.</p>
