 <p><strong><u>Chapter 511: Experts of the Strong Ranking</u></strong></p>
 <p>The ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ was born underground. After experiencing the pure pressure of the land, it would take the form of fog after a hundred years and would be called ‘Core Fog.’ At this point, it possessed the unique effect of strengthening one’s body. After merging for over a thousand years, it would form a liquid form. If the quality was even higher, it would be called ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’ It possessed the magical effect of washing and refining one’s bones. Moreover, that extremely pure and large strength of the land in the milk would even help a person who had reached the peak to break through the barrier between levels. Of course, there was naturally still quite a great chance of failure.</p>
 <p>Ordinary speaking, due to the harsh condition for the formation of this kind of ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ there were very few people who had actually seen it. Even Xiao Yan had only heard Yao Lao randomly mentioning it once before. At that time, Xiao Yan had firmly remembered it in his heart because he had heard of the magical effect of washing and refining one’s bones that made one greedy for it. Therefore, Xiao Yan remembered it from his heart now. It was just unexpected that he would actually hear of this natural spiritual treasure that not many people knew about.</p>
 <p>The wild joy on his face was maintained for quite awhile before it was gradually withdrawn. He carefully suppressed his aura and breathing. His gaze, however, involuntarily shot into the mountain valley as his heart softly muttered, “Is that ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ inside?”</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you interested?” Yao Lao’s laughter sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, it would be a lie if I said that I am not interested in this kind of mysterious treasure. If I am able to obtain a little ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ it is likely that I would be able to break through to the Dou Ling class within one to two months. Moreover, didn’t Teacher also say that this ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ also possesses the effect of washing and refining one’s bones? If I am able to obtain it, I think that it would have a benefit that is difficult to measure when I break through to the Dou Wang class in the future.” Xiao Yan did not hide his yearning for the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’ He was carrying quite a number of things on his back: his missing father, the shame of being chased out of the empire, and the possibility of having to contend with that extremely mysterious ‘Hall of Souls’ in the future because of Yao Lao. These things required him to possess extremely great strength. Otherwise, forget about searching for his father and protecting Yao Lao. It was likely that he would not even dare to return to the Jia Ma Empire. What face did a dog who had lost his home and could not even return to it have to act free and unfretted outside?</p>
 <p>“Yes. It is indeed totally beyond my expectations to be able to find the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ here. The benefits you would receive from obtaining it are also something that is understood without saying. However, this ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ is not something easy to deal with. Normally, a Dou Wang class Magical Beast may already possess some intelligence but it would be far from the level where it can open its mouth to speak. I think that this should be related to the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ that it is protecting.” Yao Lao smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. Even a Unique Beast of Ancient Times like the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python’ is unable to speak at the Dou Wang class. The ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ may be considered a rare unique beast, but it is difficult for it to be comparable to the ‘Heaven Swallowing Python.’ Therefore, the only thing that could explain why its intelligence was so great was the legendary ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’</p>
 <p>“What should we do now? Should we take advantage of their fight and secretly enter?” Xiao Yan asked softly in his heart,</p>
 <p>“It is somewhat impossible for you to enter from the entrance of the valley. If you are to fly, the movement in the air would likely attract their attention. The strength of these fellows is quite great. Therefore, it is very difficult for you to sneak in under their eyes.” Yao Lao helplessly said.</p>
 <p>“What should we do then?”</p>
 <p>“Wait. Let’s see if we can once again be fishermen.” Yao Lao smiled gently and said.</p>
 <p>“Teacher is thinking of waiting for them to fight until both parties are seriously injured?” Xiao Yan was startled before he immediately spoke awkwardly. It was fine if he was not acquainted with all of them. However, Xiao Yan felt that Han Yue was not a bad person. Hearing the conversation earlier, it appeared that she was the first to find this place. If he was to be a fisherman and snatch their spoils from the fight, it would really be a little…</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, you have overestimated this group of people. Although this ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ appears to have just entered its adult stage, it is ultimately a kind of rare unique Magical Beast no matter how one puts it. This kind of Magical Beast has a wild and violent blood flowing within it. It would be fine if this kind of wild and violent bloodline was not awakened. Once it is awaken, even a five star elite Dou Wang could only temporarily hide from its cutting edge. This group of people doesn’t even have a true strong Dou Wang. How can they defeat it? At that time, there might be some injuries and deaths if they mess up.” Yao Lao smiled and explained</p>
 <p>Shock drew across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard this. It was really unexpected that this ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ explosive strength would actually be this frightening. From the looks of it, it appeared that the chances of Han Yue’s group obtaining victory were not very great.</p>
 <p>During the time that Xiao Yan was conversing with Yao Lao, the tense atmosphere suddenly erupted under the provocation of the aura. Five figures turned into vague shadows. Each of them carried incomparably ferocious forces. They appeared like a few different colored beams of light as they viciously attacked the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ that stood loftily.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Lin Xiuya’s group still refused to withdraw, the crimson color and killing intent within the eyes of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ became much denser. At a glance, it caused people to form a cold feeling within their hearts. An enormous sharp claw wildly slammed against its chest as the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ bowl like mouth was widened. An ear-piercing roar that could shatter an enormous rock was explosively released.</p>
 <p>Under the loud roar of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape,’ the speed of Lin Xiuya and the others clearly became a little slower. The moment the speed of their bodies had been reduced, the feet of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ viciously stomped on the ground. The entire mountain valley trembled at this moment. His body borrowed the strong pushing force, and the ape shot out like a white-colored giant cannonball. In the blink of an eye, the ape appeared in front of Yan Hao, who was charging right at the front of the group. It clenched its claws and cold air swiftly agglomerated around it. In an instant, it formed a half-foot-long icy-cold claw.</p>
 <p>The icy-cold claw danced and grabbed at Yan Hao’s heart. This kind of vicious tactic carried a sharp killing intent. There was not the slightest intention of sparring and warming up. From the looks of it, this ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ had the intention to kill from the start.</p>
 <p>The ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ had an agility and speed that did not correspond to its enormous size. This clearly far exceeded Yan Hao’s expectations. However, Yan Hao was not a weakling without combat experience. Despite being surprised, the jet-black metal hammer in his hand was violently lashed out with inertia. The metal hammer tore through the air, emitting a sharp sound that caused even Xiao Yan, who was hiding in the forest, to frown slightly.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The claw and the metal hammer violently collided. Ice pieces scattered in all directions under the loud sound of the collision. Yan Hao’s body swiftly shot back. Along the way, the branches on the trees that his body collided completely broke. His body finally came to a stop after breaking over ten large trees in this manner. He lifted his face and there was a faint trace of bloodstain on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, good. It is worthy of being the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ that is known for its strength. However, you are still a little lacking if you want to kill me with one blow.” Yan Hao parted his mouth and laughed after rubbing away the blood trace from the corner of his mouth. He ignored the injuries on his body as he once again tightened his grip on the metal hammer. Just like a humanoid tank, he charged at the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ which was being entertained by Lin Xiuya and three others.</p>
 <p>The few human figures swiftly flashed at the entrance to the valley. The formation that they formed firmly locked the enormous white figure at their middle. Wild and powerful Dou Qi violently gushed out as though it had been freed. Various extremely strong Dou Techniques carried sharp wind and numerous low cries as they heavily hacked at the body of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape.’ The attacks brought about ice shavings and white-colored fur that scattered in all directions.</p>
 <p>The ferocity of the attack of Lin Xiuya and the others had somewhat exceeded Xiao Yan and even Yao Lao’s expectations. These fellows did indeed possess a body of impressive abilities proving their ability to be among the most precious top ten on the ‘Strong Ranking’ within the Inner Academy. Their attacks may be ferocious but the defense of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ was similarly frighteningly firm. Under its fur, it appeared to be covered by a layer of hard ice. No matter how one attacked it, one would only bring about waves of ice shavings. One ultimately had difficulty causing it much substantial damage. According to this kind of fighting, it was likely that Lin Xiuya’s group would not be able to hang on for long. After all, the recovery ability of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ was far from what humans could compare with.</p>
 <p>The fighting between both parties became increasingly intense with the flow of time and was becoming increasingly heated. The messy large rocks that spread all over the entrance of the valley were shattered as the energy from both sides collided. This kind of destructive strength caused Xiao Yan, who was hiding in the darkness, to become somewhat speechless. They were really worthy of being strong people who were about to enter the Dou Wang class. This kind of fighting strength was indeed far from what a Da Dou Shi, or even an ordinary Dou Ling could compare with.</p>
 <p>The green-colored longsword in Lin Xiuya’s hand shook. His feet gently pressed on a spiralling wind that had surfaced out of nowhere and his body rose into mid-air. His originally clear and indifferent face of his had an additional solemness at this moment. He eyed the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ surrounded by Yan Hao and the three others below. It appeared lively and showed no sign of tiredness. He frowned intently as the long sword in his hand trembled. Green-colored Dou Qi moved along his Qi Pathsand swiftly swarmed into the body of the sword. Following the pouring of Dou Qi, the surface of the green-colored longsword suddenly became vaguely visible. Its size also suddenly expanded by dozens of times. A substance-like tornado lingered on the surface of the sword while the surrounding air began to fluctuate swiftly.</p>
 <p>“Yan Hao. Block the beast!” Lin Xiuya cried in a deep voice as he held the green-colored longsword tightly in his hands.</p>
 <p>Sensing the frightening wind that was being brewed mid-air, Yan Hao and the rest understood that Lin Xiuya was displaying his masterpiece. They immediately nodded. The attack from their hands also grew increasingly ferocious as they tried their best to prevent the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ from interrupting the Lin Xiuya’s agglomeration of Dou Qi.</p>
 <p>The ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ similarly sensed the frightening force that was agglomerating in the sky. The sharpness of this force caused the fur on its entire body to stand vertically. A stern roar was wildly released from its mouth. Immediately, a snow-white energy ripple was swiftly released. Some of the enormous rocks along the way were instantly turned into snow-colored ice pieces after the icy-cold ripple passed them.</p>
 <p>The sudden eruption from the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ caused Yan Hao and the others to hurriedly withdraw their hands. Their bodies hurriedly flashed and dodged the icy-cold ripples chasing after them.</p>
 <p>After forcing back Yan Hao and the others with one blow, a savage look appeared on the face of the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape.’ Its feet abruptly stomped on the ground and its enormous body rushed explosively to the skyline. In an instant, it appeared in front of Lin Xiuya, who had borrowed the strength of the swirling wind to barely remain in mid-air. He parted his mouth at the latter and killing intent surged in its blood-red eyes. Its sharp claw directly and viciously grabbed at Lin Xiuya’s head. From the looks of the posture, if he were to be struck, Lin Xiuya would likely end up with his brains scattered in all directions regardless of how strong he was.</p>
 <p>Hiding in the forest, Xiao Yan eyed Lin Xiuya as the ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape’ closed in. He involuntarily shook his head. It was likely that the odds were against this unlucky fellow...</p>
 <p>However, the moment Xiao Yan quietly sighed in his heart, he saw the back of Lin Xiuya, who had nowhere to borrow strength from in mid-air, shake. Immediately, a pair of thin green-colored energy wings suddenly shot out. The wings flapped as his body nimbly dodged the killing move of the agile ‘Snow Demon Sky Ape.’ Moreover, he borrowed the strength and rose dozens of feet higher. The longsword in his hand swiftly trembled and repeatedly emitted a clear sword humming. The air around him fluctuated intensely. Clearly, Lin Xiuya’s incomparably sharp Dou Technique had been brewed to completion!</p>
 <p>“This… Dou Qi transformation into wings? This fellow… has advanced to the Dou Wang class?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stared blankly at the pair of energy wings on Lin Xiuya’s back. Everyone in the battleground was startled at this moment.</p>
