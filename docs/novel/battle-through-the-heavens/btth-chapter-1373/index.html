 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1373: The Turbulence of the North-western Continent</u></strong></p>
 <p>Yao Lao slowly nodded when he saw the sudden change in Xiao Yan’s expression. He said, “Rather, it should be said that the entire north-western region of the continent is in trouble…”</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows. The north-western continent did not have as many experts as the Central Plains. There might be an uncountable number of sects and empires, but all of them were ultimately in dispute with each other. Although some strong factions intended to dominate everyone, they were ultimately unable to achieve their aim. Moreover, the so-called strong factions in the north-western region of the continent would only be tier one factions in the Central Plains. They would not be any stronger than the four pavilion factions. Hence, some of the factions and experts within the Central Plains did not place much importance on the any other region.</p>
 <p>“Originally, the north-western continent was not in turmoil, but a year ago, a faction known as the Profound Lion Sect suddenly began to engage in a large scale war. No one was a match for the experts from the sect. Within less than half a year, nearly half of the north-western continent ended up under the control of the Profound Lion Sect.” Yao Lao slowly landed on a mountain as he softly explained.</p>
 <p>“Profound Lion Sect? Are they very strong?” Xiao Yan frowned and asked. Although the north-western continent did not have as many hidden experts as the Central Plains, it was an extremely large stretch of land and there were naturally many Dou Zun class experts. However, relying on the strength of a sect to occupy half of the north-western continent was something that would cause others to feel some disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Although the Profound Lion Sect can be ranked among the top ten in the north-western continent, it is not unbeatable. This time around, their strength suddenly soared. Moreover, they gained many powerful mysterious experts…” Yao Lao replied in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“There is some other mysterious faction interfering in the north-western region of the continent?” Xiao Yan was startled. The factions in the Central Plains were extremely strong, but they ultimately looked down on the other parts of the continent that were not part of the Central Plains. Hence, rarely would a factions interfere in the matters of other regions. After all, these areas were extremely chaotic, and even if they could secretly control the regions, it would not benefit them. They might end up losing more than they would gain.</p>
 <p>“Hall of Souls?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan frowned. Suddenly he saw Yao Lao’s solemn expression. His heart shook as he made a guess.</p>
 <p>“That’s right…” Yao Lao nodded. He continued, “Based on the situation that was transmitted back, many Hall of Souls experts have indeed appeared with the Profound Lion Sect…”</p>
 <p>“Why would the Hall of Souls have nothing better to do than to head to the north-western region of the continent and stir up such a big war?”</p>
 <p>“Gathering souls… the factions in the Central Plains are interrelated and complicated. Even the Hall of Souls would not dare to easily start a big war, but the situation is different in the north-western continent. Given the strength of the Hall of Souls, it is dominant enough to wage a one-sided war. All they need to do is appear after the battle and collect a countless number of souls…” Yao Lao knit his brows and explained the situation.</p>
 <p>“Why are they anxiously using such a method to gather spiritual bodies now? In the past, the Hall of Souls would only quietly gather souls. They have never started a big war before.” Xiao Yan asked uncertainly.</p>
 <p>“The Hall of Souls definitely has many schemes to gather souls. However, I am also uncertain of the reason. Back then, they only wanted me to join them after capturing me. I am aware that they are interested in my alchemist skills… all I can do is refine medicinal pills, but the overwhelming and mysterious strength of the Hall of Souls’ chief requires a tier 9 medicinal pill. However, it is not easy to refine such a medicinal pill.” Yao Lao softly sighed and replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart had become a little heavy for some unknown reason after hearing Yao Lao’s soft sigh. Although he was not aware what the Hall of Souls was planning, he was certain that they were definitely preparing for a great scheme. Otherwise, why would they gather so many souls? Moreover, they had clearly increased their gathering rate. Could it be that they could not endure any longer?</p>
 <p>“Hun clan… just what exactly are you planning?”</p>
 <p>“The north-western continent is in chaos and the Profound Lion Sect continues to expand their territory. Those who do not submit to them would have their sect or empire destroyed. This has undoubtedly greatly increased the speed at which the Hall of Souls are gathering spiritual bodies. The quality might not be high, but they can make up for it with quantity.” Yao Lao glanced at Xiao Yan as he said, “As for your Yan Alliance, it has already become a powerful alliance that could be ranked among the top three of the north-western continent after being developed by Medusa and the rest during these years. Normally speaking, the Profound Lion Sect is no match for the Yan Alliance. Unfortunately, there is the addition of the Hall of Souls… with the aid of the experts from the Hall of Souls, the Yan Alliance can only end up at a disadvantage.”</p>
 <p>“A couple of months ago, the territory of the Yan Alliance shrank. They are gradually shrinking back toward the Jia Ma Empire. We have also obtained news about it at that time. The Little Fairy Doctor and the rest hurried to the Jia Ma Empire after obtaining this news. Qing Tan also followed because the fate of the Sky Serpent Mansion is similarly quite bad.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was gloomy. This damn Hall of Souls never stopped causing trouble for even a moment.</p>
 <p>“I have also dispatched some experts from the Falling Star Pavilion to follow the Little Fairy Doctor’s group when they left. However, I think that they will find it difficult to handle the situation…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He clenched his hand and said, “Looks like… I will also have to hurry back.”</p>
 <p>The Yan Alliance had Medusa, his big brother, second brother, and all the members of the Xiao clan. Hence, he needed to reveal himself when the Yan Alliance faced such trouble!</p>
 <p>Yao Lao was unsurprised when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. He nodded slightly and said, “Aye, this time around, I will dispatch some Elders from the Falling Star Pavilion, who are five star Dou Zuns, with you when you head to the Jia Ma Empire. Moreover, they are privy to more information than you. They will help you understand the situation of the north-western continent. I will personally remain in the Falling Star Pavilion to guard against any Hall of Souls’ schemes of diverting our strength away…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before nodding.</p>
 <p>“We will put the matter of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame aside for now. In any case, there’s still some time before the ‘Spatial Trade Fair’ begins. Before that, we must resolve the trouble of the Yan Alliance.” Yao Lao smiled and continued. “Don’t rush and leave today. The Central Plains region and the north-western continent are too far apart. You would need over two months to fly back. Hence, we must build a wormhole…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. A wormhole was something that could be built by anyone who had reached the Dou Zun class. However, building a lengthy wormhole that stretched from Central Plains to the north-western continent was not something that an ordinary Dou Zun could achieve. Fortunately, Yao Lao’s strength was currently at the Ban Sheng class. It should not be too difficult to build.</p>
 <p>“I used a temporarily wormhole to send the Little Fairy Doctor’s group away. Since then, I have been preparing a stable wormhole. Once it is successfully built, it will become a pathway that connects the Falling Star Pavilion to the north-western continent. Once you take over the Falling Star Pavilion in the future, the Falling Star Pavilion and the Yan Alliance will merge…” Yao Lao laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded and sighed in relief. If they could really build a wormhole that connected to the north-western continent, it would undoubtedly save him a great deal of time.</p>
 <p>“Rest for today. You have been tired during this period of time…” Yao Lao spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not reject the offer. He nodded before suddenly recalling something. After which, he took the emerald jade token that Yao Xing Ji had given him out of his Storage Ring and handed it to Yao Lao. “This is the Yao ceremony (clan ceremony) invitation of the Yao clan. They asked me to hand it to teacher.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s hand immediately trembled when he heard the words ‘Yao ceremony (clan ceremony).’ Although it was minor, it did not escape Xiao Yan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s eyes stared at the emerald jade token. It was a long time later before he inhaled a deep breath of air. His hand trembled as he slowly received it. Finally, he put it in his Storage Ring and softly said, “Don’t be concerned about this matter. We should build the wormhole.”</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Xiao Yan nodded. Although Yao Lao did not display much on his face, Xiao Yan could still sense that Yao Lao’s heart was not calm.</p>
 <p>“It seems that teacher will not reject this Yao ceremony (clan ceremony) invitation just as Yao Xing Ji had claimed… I wonder just what this Yao ceremony is to cause Yao Lao to show such a reaction.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao merely smiled when he saw Xiao Yan’s flickering eyes, but he did not explain about the Yao ceremony. He gently patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders and laughed, “Leave, go back to your room and rest. It is likely that this half a year has not been relaxing… I would like to allow you to rest properly for some time…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his head in an unconcerned manner. He was used to running around after years of training. One must ultimately pay in order to protect things. However, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to feel a little pleased was that the current him was not like himself from back when he needed Yao Lao’s help in order to do anything. Now, he was a true top tier expert who could carry his own weight!</p>
 <p>“Once I finish building the wormhole, you will be able to travel to the north-western region of the continent. Ha ha, now that I think about it, it has been many years since you left. It is time to return and take a look...” Yao Lao spoke in a somewhat harsh tone. When Xiao Yan had left the Jia Ma Empire for the first time back then, he had been a tender youth. The youth from back then has become a renowned top-notch expert across the continent.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. His heart also felt a sense of lose. Without realizing it, he had been away from the Jia Ma Empire for many years. He wondered just how big brother, second brother, and the rest had been during these years, especially Medusa… if that’s how much time had passed, it was likely… his child was already four or five years old…</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case… it seems that I have become a father…”</p>
 <p>A special feeling involuntarily rose within Xiao Yan’s heart when he thought of this. It was as though his heart had matured once again at this moment.</p>
