 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1538: Deciding the Victor</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Crunch!”</p>
 <p>The mouth on the human face that was formed by the Nihility Devouring Flame emitted a somewhat miserable sharp cry after being ruthlessly bitten by Little Yi. The face began to furiously struggle. Black flames continued to erupt from the face’s body. They wildly swept toward Little Yi.</p>
 <p>“Yi Wa!”</p>
 <p>Little Yi ignored the retaliation of the Nihility Devouring Flame. The pink-colored flame on his body agglomerated into a crystal-like armor. Regardless of how the Devouring Flame emitted its devouring power, it was unable to forcefully extract the energy within Little Yi’s body.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>While blocking the devouring power from the Nihility Devouring Flame, Little Yi’s tightly clenched fist continued to smash the human face and widen his mouth. Each time he swung his fist, clusters of pink flames would invade the face. The black flames had gradually become a little scattered.</p>
 <p>“Bastard, you actually dare to injure me?”</p>
 <p>The collapsed feeling that was being emitted from the human face made it appear somewhat frightening. It was only a seed flame of the Nihility Devouring Flame while Little Yi was a fire spirit formed from the merger of six types of Heavenly Flames, including the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Forget about a mere flame seed. Even if its actual form were to appear, it would not be easy to defeat Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Yi Wa!”</p>
 <p>The current Little Yi’s intelligence seemed to be increasing. Not only could he understand the human language, even the emotions on his small face were becoming more life-like. Hence, a ferocity surged onto his small face after he heard the Nihility Devouring Flame’s cry. His hand grabbed the huge human face as a monstrous pink flame surged out of his palm. This flame actually wrapped around the Nihility Devouring Flame.</p>
 <p>“You… you dare to refine me? You are seeking death!” The actions of Little Yi caused a horror to rise onto that human face. Its mouth cried out in a stern voice. The Nihility Devouring Flame had never met anything that could resist its devouring power during all these years, but its mysterious ability, which it was proud of, was completely useless this time around.</p>
 <p>“This is bad, I have lost connection with the fire seed…”</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls, who was standing a short distance away, suddenly revealed a different expression. At this moment, the connection between him and the Nihility Devouring Flame’s flame seed had been severed.</p>
 <p>“The Heavenly Flame within this brat’s body had undergone a mutation. It is unafraid of the Nihility Devouring Flame’s devouring power. I have really miscalculated this time around.” The eyes of the chief of the Hall of Souls rapidly flickered. He immediately clenched his teeth, and his body rushed toward the pink fire barrier in the sky. Although this was only a seed flame, it was something that he had spent a long time begging for from the clan. If he slowly refined it, his body would also end up possessing a devouring power. Although this devouring power could not be compared with the Nihility Devouring Flame, it could be considered a killing blow when fighting with others. Moreover, he would have difficulty accounting to the clan if he lost it. Hence, he could not allow any accidents to happen to it!</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, hall chief, other people should not intervene in the fight between Heavenly Flames…” However, the chief of the Hall of Souls had only just moved when a figure appeared in front of him like a shadow. That smiling figure belonged to Xiao Yan, who had been watching the chief.</p>
 <p>The expression of the chief of the Hall of Souls turned cold when he saw Xiao Yan intervene and block him. He wasn’t bothered by his diminished Dou Qi after it had been devoured by the Nihility Devouring Flame earlier. His body moved and unleashed his sharpest, most ferocious attack on Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan merely smiled because of this wild and violent attack from the chief of the Hall of Souls. He could clearly sense that the current chief of the Hall of Souls was much weaker when compared to earlier. From the looks of it, the Nihility Devouring Flame had swallowed a lot of his Dou Qi earlier. The chief of the Hall of Souls was naturally no longer able to pose much of a threat to Xiao Yan in this state.</p>
 <p>The both of them once again unleashed fierce attacks while Little Yi in the sky widened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of pink flames. These flames were poured into the flame cluster in front of him. That Nihility Devouring Flame, which was only able to barely block the pressure from the surrounding flames, was finally unable to endure the pressure at this moment. A miserable screech was let out. The black flames that had formed a human face exploded apart. They transformed into black fire snakes that randomly entered and exited the pink fire cluster like headless houseflies.</p>
 <p>“This is bad!”</p>
 <p>The explosion of the Nihility Devouring Flame caused the expressions on the faces of Hun Qian Mo and Old Man Hun Mo to drastically change. Both of them exchanged glances and simultaneously rushed forward. They were planning on intervening to rescue the Nihility Devouring Flame.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, are you planning to break the rules?” The expressions of Yao Lao’s group turned slightly cold upon seeing them move. Both Xiao Chen and the ancestor from the Pill Tower swiftly rushed forward and blocked Hun Qian Mo duo. At the same time, the remaining Dou Sheng class experts from the Sky Mansion Alliance moved and restrained the few elite Dou Shengs from the Hall of Souls. In an instant, the Fallen Mountain had become extremely tense. A complete chaotic battle would erupt at the first sign of a disagreement.</p>
 <p>“Hun Qian Mo, my Sky Mansion Alliance is not the least bit afraid of you if the Hall of Souls wishes for an all out war!” Yao Lao cried out in a stern voice.</p>
 <p>Hun Qian Mo narrowed his eyes. He slowly swept his eyes around him. The lineup from both parties was about the same. If they were to really fight, the Hall of Souls would definitely end up with a miserable victory if they even could win. Such a lose was something that the Hun clan was trying its best to avoid.</p>
 <p>“What should we do?’ A cold glint surged within the eyes of Old Man Hun Mo as he softly asked.</p>
 <p>Hun Qian Mo stared intently at the young green-clothed man in front of him. The young man maintained a calm expression. His tender eyes were like a quiet lake, appearing unfathomable. Hun Qian Mo had exchanged blows with the young man earlier and naturally understood just how frightening this old demon, who had lived for thousands of years, was. He knew that it would be difficult to defeat the other party even if he unleashed his entire strength…</p>
 <p>“Everything will continue as it is.”</p>
 <p>Hun Qian Mo inhaled a deep breath of air before stating in a low and deep voice.</p>
 <p>Both parties relaxed slightly after hearing his words. They immediately pulled back some distance. That extremely tense atmosphere was forcefully suppressed.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Little Yi’s huge baby hand slammed into the fire cluster when both parties pulled back. That cluster of flames began to wildly rotate before transforming into a firestorm that completely shattered the black flame fire snakes. Finally, he opened his mouth and swallowed the firestorm into his stomach.</p>
 <p>Although the devouring power was a mysterious energy that only the Nihility Devouring Flame possessed, the Heavenly Flames were just like wild beasts. The strong devoured the weak. Due to them coming from a similar origin, the more powerful flame frequently consumed the weaker flame. When Xiao Yan had wanted to obtain the Falling Heart Flame in the past, the flame had coveted the Green Lotus Core Flame within Xiao Yan’s body…</p>
 <p>The Nihility Devouring Flame was ranked second on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. If one were to talk about it, it should be a little stronger than the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. However, this current Devouring Flame was merely a seed flame. It was extremely easy for Little Yi to consume it.</p>
 <p>“Brub…”</p>
 <p>Little Yi emitted a strange sound from his throat after devouring the seed flame. He immediately patted his stomach in an expression of satisfaction. His body swayed and returned to the size of a lotus. After which, his gaze shifted to Xiao Yan, who was battling the chief of the Hall of Souls. Only then did it drift to a spot some distance away from the battleground in front of many pairs of eyes. He beckoned with his hand and many slowly rotating fire lotuses began to quietly roll around his body.</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls, who was entangled with Xiao Yan, caught a glimpse of these lotuses through his peripheral vision. His heart was so shocked that it trembled. Before he could pull back, Little Yi’s fleshy hand pointed him out, “Yi Wa, beat!”</p>
 <p>“Swoosh!”</p>
 <p>Little Yi’s voice had just appeared when over ten fire lotuses formed a line that swiftly shot through the sky and wildly exploded on the chief of the Hall of Souls.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!”</p>
 <p>The ten fire lotuses continuously exploded in the sky. A terrifying fire wave swept apart with a frighteningly high temperature. Those experts, who had originally withdrawn a great distance, once again hurriedly pulled back.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>The ten fire lotuses might have only been formed by two different Heavenly Flames, but they had stirred a domino effect after the first one exploded. Their might was so strong that it was frightening. Even someone as strong as the chief of the Hall of Souls was blasted until he emitted a muffled moan. A green smoke was miserably formed around his body as he hurriedly pulled back in the sky.</p>
 <p>The figure floating in the sky pulled back by ten thousand feet. That figure, the chief of the Hall of Souls, finally forcefully stabilized his body. He swallowed the fresh blood that reached his throat. Some shock appeared within his eyes. He had not expected this unassuming fire baby to actually possess such a powerful fighting strength.</p>
 <p>“Hall of Souls’ chief, you will perhaps lose this match…”</p>
 <p>The moment the chief of the Hall of Souls was feeling shocked by Little Yi’s powerful fighting strength, a ghost-like figure suddenly appeared behind him. A sharp wind mercilessly struck his neck.</p>
 <p>“In your dreams!”</p>
 <p>The attack came swiftly, but the chief of the Hall of Souls also reacted quickly. He instinctively turned his body and a punch clashed with Xiao Yan’s palm wind. A deep sound exploded at the point of contact. The bodies of the two were sent flying backwards.</p>
 <p>“You are still a little lacking if you wish to kill this chief!”</p>
 <p>The eyes of the chief of the Hall of Souls were gloomy as he glared at Xiao Yan while he flew backwards. He cried out in a dense voice, “Consider yourself lucky this time around. This chief will personally take revenge the next time around!”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps… you will not have the opportunity!”</p>
 <p>A chill surged within Xiao Yan’s eyes and an icy-cold smile rose from the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls’ heart became slightly cold after seeing Xiao Yan’s expression. He seemed to have sensed something as he suddenly turned his head. A high temperature pounced over. Another ten fire lotuses formed a straight line in front of his eyes as they rushed over with lightning-like speed. They violently collided with his body in front of the many shocked eyes from the people all over the mountains.</p>
 <p>“How is this possible…”</p>
 <p>The heart of the chief of the Hall of Souls was shocked because of the frighteningly wild energy that was on a collision course with his body.</p>
