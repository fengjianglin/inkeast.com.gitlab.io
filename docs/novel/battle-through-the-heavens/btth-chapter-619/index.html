 <p>The merger of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’.</p>
 <p>If he managed to successfully merge these two different kinds of flame, Xiao Yan’s strength would not only greatly soar, but the ‘Flame Mantra’ would also evolve by leaps and bounds. At that time, Xiao Yan’s fighting strength would once again make a great advancement.</p>
 <p>However, if he were to fail, his fate would be even more miserable than the last time. It would not be overboard to describe it as beyond redemption.</p>
 <p>The ‘Flame Mantra’ was able to gift people with the ability to control a few kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’. Someone who had obtained such ability would also have to pay a price that was many times higher than an ordinary person…</p>
 <p>The cream-colored flame was flowing fiercely in a torrent-like manner within his crystal clear Qi Paths. After having been completely refined by Xiao Yan, it appeared like an obedient baby that did not have the slightest resistance to his commands. It was totally void of the untamed manner it had possessed before.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind controlled the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ as it followed his Qi Paths and flowed about. After this continued for a couple of circulations, it slowly roamed about his Qi Paths before being pouring into the interior of the vortex which had become completely empty.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled when the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ completely entered the vortex. His mind moved, and he could see green-colored flames immediately flowing out in all directions from the ‘Acceptance Spirit’ in the middle, which was used to store the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>Following the appearance of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, the originally quiet ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ had begun to seethe. The ‘Heavenly Flames’ possessed an extremely great destructive strength. If two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ were to collide together, it would be the case of swallowing the other party or being swallowed by it. There was no other choice. Hence, the moment the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ appeared, the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ was still able to rely on its instincts to be prepared to create trouble despite it being suppressed by Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Of course, the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ was not the only one ready to cause trouble. The usually obedient ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ which had saved Xiao Yan in countless life and death situations had also begun to roll and leap around. Its instincts drove it to possess the desire to swallow the ‘Heavenly Flame’ in front of it. In that way, it would become even stronger.</p>
 <p>“No wonder it is always said that an alchemist could at the very most control one kind of ‘Heavenly Flame’. It is unexpected that their resistance toward each other is actually so intense…” Xiao Yan helplessly spoke in his heart as he suppressed the rolling and leaping of both the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’.</p>
 <p>“If I did not possess the ‘Flame Mantra’, attempting to merge them together would be the equivalent of leading a flame to incinerate oneself.” Xiao Yan repeated. He had just moved his mind when a powerful Dou Qi swiftly surfaced from his body. It completed a cycle while following the route of the ‘Flame Mantra’ before being carefully poured into the vortex. It became like a boundary line that stood between the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ and the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’.</p>
 <p>“Next… let’s… begin the merger.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind ruthlessly inhaled a breath of non-existent air. He finally cease hesitating. An order was issued from his mind!</p>
 <p>Following the issue of the order, the suppression on the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’ also disappeared. Having lost the suppression, they began to fight like ferocious tigers that had just descended a mountain. They both carried a roar that caused one to be stricken with terror and come rumbling violently down. Finally, the two kinds of flames violently collided together.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Although there was a layer of ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi blocking the two flames, the collision still emitted a sound that was low, deep, loud and clear. A great heat quietly rose from the vortex.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan carefully controlled the ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi as he attempted to isolate the two kinds of flames. Despite this, however, the two ‘Heavenly Flames,’ which had approached each other, also began to churn repeatedly like tidal waves. Finally, they appeared to be contesting with each other, repeatedly unleashing high temperatures. That manner was as though they wanted to defeat the other party.</p>
 <p>Waves of ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi repeatedly flowed and circulated within Xiao Yan’s Qi Paths before pouring into the vortex. After which, they intruded into the interior of the two ‘Heavenly Flames’. Following the addition of the ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi which possessed an unusual strength, the originally explosive-like ‘Heavenly Flames,’ which exploded upon contact earlier, gradually became much quieter.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief upon observing the strong effect of the ‘Flame Mantra.’ Having seen the frightening repulsion between the two ‘Heavenly Flames’ earlier, he really did not dare to say that they would just merge together. Fortunately, the ‘Flame Mantra’ was indeed worthy of being a mysterious Qi Method that even Yao Lao had continuous praise for. The effect of reconciling the ‘Heavenly Flames’ was indeed extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind focused intently on the movement of the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’ within the vortex. Only after seeing that they had became much calmer did Xiao Yan cautiously remove a Dou Qi layer between them.</p>
 <p>The thin Dou Qi layer disappeared. A green and white-colored flame finally made contact without any gap between them…</p>
 <p>There was not the slightest unusual movement amid the calmness when they made contact. However, just as Xiao Yan was about to sigh in relief, a low, deep explosive sound suddenly appeared within the vortex, causing his heart to leap violently.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind shifted toward the interior of the vortex in a lightning-like manner. The chaotic situation that was similarly to a volcano erupting deep within the vast ocean caused all the pores in Xiao Yan’s body to shrink tightly.</p>
 <p>“Dammit… can these ‘Heavenly Flames’ actually merge together?” Xiao Yan could not resist cursing as he watched the two different colored chaotic fire clusters that were repeatedly emitting slight explosions. The meeting of these two things was similar to gunpowder meeting a spark. The most direct consequence was that it resulted in an intense explosion. However, these two things were mixed with quite a great amount of ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi by Xiao Yan. Otherwise, the explosion might well have been even more violent.</p>
 <p>However, from the looks of the situation, it appeared that the explosion was also becoming increasingly intense. Not long later, the violent explosion might well blast apart the interior of Xiao Yan’s body until it turned into fragments.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and shook his head as he sensed the waves of intense twitching pain that was emitted from the vortex. His mind moved and powerful Dou Qi surged out from all over his body like floodwater. Finally, it followed the route of the ‘Flame Mantra’ as it began to circulate before being poured unceasingly into the vortex. They were subsequently added into the two colored fire clusters whose explosion sounds were becoming louder and clearer.</p>
 <p>This action by Xiao Yan was the only solution that he could think of. Since the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’ had great difficulty merging, he would simply go all out and pour the ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi to reconcile them until they could co-exist.</p>
 <p>Although this was a last minute action by Xiao Yan, its effect was quite good. As an unceasing amount of ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi was poured in, the explosion sounds within the vortex gradually weakened. Although these two flames still refused to accept each other, any attack that was erupted for the time being would at least not be too ferocious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s tensed mind finally relaxed upon seeing that this method was effective. He knew that it was definitely not going to be a fast thing for the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ to merge perfectly. It was already quite a great improvement to prevent them from erupting into conflict the moment they met.</p>
 <p>The ‘Flame Mantra’ Dou Qi was still continuously poured into the vortex. Xiao Yan also understood this was a prolonged battle. Hence, he entered his training mode in an extremely fast manner. After which, he relied on absorbing the exterior energy to provide sufficient Dou Qi that was needed to maintain the peace between the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>If it was the degree of energy absorption that Xiao Yan possessed in the past, it would naturally be unable to meet such a requirement. Fortunately, however, Xiao Yan had currently advanced to the Dou Wang class. His Dou Qi absorption was something that could no longer be compared to the past. Therefore, he was able to maintain this large consumption.</p>
 <p>This was a long battle. Xiao Yan would definitely win if he could endure. The precondition, however, was that no drastic or unexpected events occur…</p>
 <p>The concept of time was similarly blurry when one was in the training mode. Thus, Xiao Yan did not know how much time had passed. He could only faintly sense from the two mixing ‘Heavenly Flames’ in his vortex that this merger had used up quite a lot of time…</p>
 <p>Of course, it might have consumed quite a lot of time, but the result that Xiao Yan reaped was also quite great. The green and white flames in the vortex, which could not tolerate each other, had already become like two slimes that were being mixed together. Although they had not merged, the traces of merger had, at the very least, appeared…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body remained in training mode. His mind, however, had once again entered that hibernation mode, allowing time to fly by. The Dou Qi in his body was continuously following the ‘Flame Mantra’ route before being habitually poured into the vortex, adding a little help for the merger of the ‘Heavenly Flame’.</p>
 <p>A long period of time quietly flowed by. At a certain moment, Xiao Yan’s asleep mind suddenly trembled. He immediately recovered his consciousness. The first thing he did was to force his mind to appear within the vortex. He glanced at it before a wild joy filled his heart.</p>
 <p>The green and white clusters of flame were completely intertwined within the vortex. A wisp of green-white flame that had been entangled for an unknown period of time by the corner of the flame suddenly emitted a faint glow. The two colored flames slowly moved amid the faint glow before gradually mixing together. At this moment, the green and white colors had completely disappeared. Replacing it was a small cluster of emerald-like dark-green flame…</p>
 <p>“Has it begun to merge…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan watched that wisp of emerald-like dark-green flame with wild joy. His heart began to leap intensely at this moment. Although this was an extremely small wisp of flame, it represented a good start. Moreover, it also meant that he did not take a wrong path.</p>
 <p>A slight smile involuntarily drew on Xiao Yan’s face as he watched the cluster of green-white flame that was exceptionally dark-green in color. Everything had entered into a formal state with some shock, but without any fear. Subsequently, he had to quietly wait for the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ to be completely merged together…</p>
 <p>Although this kind of merger was extremely slow, a corner of the dawn of success had already been revealed. Xiao Yan was also able to put down an uneasy, large stone within his heart.</p>
 <p>Perhaps, when that green-white color was completely transformed into an emerald-like dark-green color, it would be the moment when the ‘Flame Mantra’ Qi Method entered its mature state. At that time, Xiao Yan’s fighting strength would also greatly soar!</p>
 <p>Moreover, the moment the two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’ completely merged together, a kind of new flame would replace the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’!</p>
 <p>Of course, the type of flame that replaced them would naturally possess the special effects of both kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame’. Perhaps, it would even be more powerful!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was filled with an anticipation for this new flame that had yet to be birthed.</p>
