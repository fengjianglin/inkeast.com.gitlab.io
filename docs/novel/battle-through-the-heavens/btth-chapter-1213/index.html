 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1213: Thanks for Conceding</u></strong></p>
 <p>A vast and mighty aura surged out of Xiao Yan’s body in all directions like an erupting volcano at this moment. The ground immediately formed countless numbers of cracks amid a cracking sound!</p>
 <p>The powerful aura that erupted from Xiao Yan also caused Yi Chen, who was in close proximity, to be shocked. Before he could recover, a fist that was wrapped by a purple-brown flame tore through space almost instantly, and it ruthlessly smashed against his hand claw.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Incomparably powerful wind ripples suddenly swept out at this moment. A layer of the hard granite floor was sent flying.</p>
 <p>The breeze carried some rock dust as it scattered. Immediately, everyone saw Yi Chen’s figure tremble within the battleground at this moment. He took some steps back before stabilizing his body. Immediately, numerous uproars involuntarily erupted.</p>
 <p>“Chief, it seems that something is not quite right. The aura of this fellow is much stronger compared to back then. Young master Yi…” An old man behind Chen Tian Nan slightly frowned as he spoke. It was surprisingly that elite Dou Zun following behind Chen Xian back then.</p>
 <p>Chen Tian Nan knit his brows when he heard this. He said, “There should not be a problem. Regardless of how strong that brat is, he is merely a nine star Dou Zong. It is not as though there haven’t been any nine star Dou Zong who have died to Yi Chen’s hands during these years.”</p>
 <p>The old man could only slightly nod and cease speaking when he saw heard Chen Tian Nan’s response.</p>
 <p>“Nine star Dou Zong?”</p>
 <p>Yi Chen’s hand slightly curled after stabilizing his body. A blood glow surged, causing the searing pain on his hand to gradually weaken. His eyes were quite gloomy as he stared at Xiao Yan across from him. However, his heart was a little shaken. Based on what he knew, Xiao Yan’s strength should only be that of a four or five star Dou Zong. Why was it that his strength had suddenly soared at this moment?</p>
 <p>A nine star Dou Zong was slightly different when compared to his strength. Moreover, the most important thing was that he might appear young, but anyone who knew him was aware that he was already older than thirty. He had ten years more than Xiao Yan to train. However, the current gap between the two was just this tiny bit. This was a serious blow to Yi Chen, who was usually extremely proud.</p>
 <p>Moreover, even with Yi Chen’s talent, he was able to reach the peak of the Dou Zong class at such an age only because of the evil Qi Method of the Profound Sky Sect, relying on swallowing flesh to obtain Dou Qi. Although this method might be strong, it had terrible repercussions. In other words, he had used all of his future life force in order to obtain this current strength. He had thought, that with this strength, he would be all-powerful among those of the same generation. However, Xiao Yan’s sudden appearance told him a cruel reality. He had not obtained the kind of strength he had wanted from what he had paid…</p>
 <p>“I have experienced killing since I was young, and I have killed countless numbers of people with my hands. After staking the remainder of my life, how is it possible for me to be unable to compare with this brat?”</p>
 <p>A crimson color that caused one’s heart to turn cold gradually surged into Yi Chen’s eyes. His eyes stared at Xiao Yan in a dense manner. The killing intent within them was about to solidify.</p>
 <p>“This person must be killed today!”</p>
 <p>A roar that was filled with killing intent resounded within his heart. Yi Chen’s hand was suddenly clenched. Blood Qi lingered over it before agglomerating into a blood-colored long spear in his palm. Both of his eyes gradually turned a blood-red color. Anyone who witnessed this scene was aware that this Devil Yi from the Profound Sky Sect, with a fierce reputation, was preparing to kill someone.</p>
 <p>The blood spear agglomerated and a bloody scent, rich to the point of causing one to puke, slowly spread out of Yi Chen’s body. Looking from a distance, the Blood Qi spread like a Killing God descending to the world.</p>
 <p>“Kill!”</p>
 <p>A low and deep roar that was filled with killing intent rolled from Yi Chen’s throat. His body disappeared in a flash. An instant later, there was a ripple in the space beside Xiao Yan. A sharp bloody spear, filled with Bloody Qi, appeared and violently pierced at Xiao Yan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Hmph.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan let out a cold snort after sensing Yi Chen’s attack. His body steadily shifted one step to the right and dodged the bloody spear.</p>
 <p>“Seven Kill Spear!”</p>
 <p>The bloody glow within Yi Chen’s eyes became denser after the spear missed. The long spear suddenly danced, transforming into numerous bloody figures that shot toward all the lethal spots on Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>Faced with Yi Chen’s storm-like attack, a silver glow began to flash under Xiao Yan’s feet. Numerous afterimages appeared, and he dodged those densely packed, blood-colored spear shadows.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The blood spear pierced explosively forward. Suddenly, a clear sound appeared. The dancing long spear stiffened and Yi Chen’s expression also changed. One could see the edge of the long spear forcefully grabbed by two of Xiao Yan’s fingers. They were covered in a purple-brown flame.</p>
 <p>The swift reaction of Xiao Yan also caused Yi Chen’s heart to feel solemn. He had vaguely sensed how troublesome it was to deal with Xiao Yan. Those nine star Dou Zong that had exchanged blows with him in the past did not even possess the ability to retaliate, much less grabbing the tip of his spear.</p>
 <p>This thought flashed across Yu Chen’s heart, and he decisively abandoned his blood spear. His body flashed and transformed into a blood shadow that rushed to Xiao Yan’s side. A vicious blood fog surged onto his palm.</p>
 <p>“Blood Evil Palm!”</p>
 <p>An unusually bloodthirsty blood palm was accompanied by a dense corrosive scent as it violently slammed toward Xiao Yan’s heart.</p>
 <p>A cold smile flashed across Xiao Yan’s face in the face of this kind of vicious attack. A thought passed through his heart and the purple-brown-colored Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame suddenly spluttered out of his chest. It transformed into a fire dragon that ruthlessly collided with Yi Chen’s palm. When the flame and the blood fog collided, a sizzling, white fog erupted. There was a vague stench being emitted.</p>
 <p>The fire dragon acted as an obstacle as Xiao Yan took a couple of continuous steps back. He studied Yi Chen’s gloomy, furious face and involuntarily let out a gentle breath. A chill surged within his dark-black eyes.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe that I cannot finish you off today!”</p>
 <p>Some impatience had finally risen within Yi Chen’s heart after he had failed to cause Xiao Yan any harm despite having repeatedly unleashed his skills. Both of his hands were clenched and a vicious blood fog continued to emit a sizzling sound as it seeped out of his pores. Finally, it transformed into a dark-red coagulated-blood color.</p>
 <p>“Heaven Offering Demon Hand!”</p>
 <p>After the cry sounded, the space where Yi Chen’s palm was located began to fluctuate. Numerous dark-black cracks began to suddenly spread out from that space. The killing aura that surged to the sky caused the expressions of those present to change.</p>
 <p>“This Yi Chen has actually used the Heaven Offering Demon Hand, one of the guarded Dou Skills of the Profound Sky Sect…”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan is indeed incredible to force Yi Chen to such an extent, but I wonder if he will be able to receive this attack…”</p>
 <p>The ferocious smile on Yi Chen’s face became even denser upon hearing the private conversations from the crowd. He was very confident in this palm of his because an expert at the peak of the Dou Zong class had died under this attack when he and this expert had sparred back then!”</p>
 <p>A blood fog permeated the stage. Yi Chen’s body trembled and once again turned into a blood shadow. He was accompanied by a monstrous killing intent as he rushed toward Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not step back when faced with Yi Chen’s unusually powerful attack. A faint excitement surged onto his face instead. His hand seal moved, beginning to change with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>“Open Mountain Seal!”</p>
 <p>A cold cry sounded within his heart. An energy light seal appeared in Xiao Yan’s palm. However, this seal had just been formed when a thought passed through Xiao Yan’s heart. His hand did not stop. Instead, it continued to change at a dazzling speed.</p>
 <p>“Sea Flipping Seal!”</p>
 <p>Another tiny but bright energy light appeared in his palm. After which, it slowly merged with the Open Mountain Seal and gathered together.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air after the two merged. His hand seal began to change once again.</p>
 <p>“Overturning Land Seal!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly cried out within his heart. A bright, purple-brown crystal glow surged out of Xiao Yan’s palm. After which, it transformed into a fist-sized crystal imprint that slowly merged with the two seals from earlier.</p>
 <p>With the merger of the Overturning Land Seal, the space in front of Xiao Yan immediately began to vehemently tremble. Tiny spatial fragments began to fall from the space before being destroyed.</p>
 <p>A three seal stacking of the God Seal Skill. Even within the Gu clan, there were few people who could merge them this perfectly!</p>
 <p>The three seals had just been merged when the blood shadow arrived with its monstrous killing intent. The palm covered in a dark-red, viscous fog outlined Yi Chen’s handsome face, causing it to appear exceptionally ferocious.</p>
 <p>“Die!”</p>
 <p>The ferocious cry had just sounded when a palm from Yi Chen ruthlessly slammed toward Xiao Yan’s chest. Space crumbled at this moment, forming numerous long dark-black lines. A monstrous bloody fog spread across the sky.</p>
 <p>A sharp bloody stench pounced over. A chill flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he looked at the ferocious expression on Yi Chen’s face. Xiao Yan’s purple-brown crystal hand quietly cut through space and violently collided with Yi Chen’s blood hand in front of many stunned people.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>An earth-shaking explosion suddenly reverberated at this moment. The stone stage, that was nearly two hundred feet large, emitted a “bang” and was blasted into debris. A circular energy ripple swiftly spread out. After which, it was suddenly resolved by a gentle force that had originated from nowhere when it was about to reach the crowd. Despite this, some of those near the edge of the stone stage were shaken until they spat out blood and stepped back.</p>
 <p>A commotion appeared in the square due to this ripple. Numerous eyes swiftly landed on the arena. Dust spread over that place. One could not clearly see the situation happening on it.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>While everyone’s heart was feeling anxious, the low, deep sound of a fist landing on a body was suddenly emitted. After which, everyone saw a figure fly out of the battleground like a kite with its string broken. Next, it violently landed on the ground and rubbed over a dozen meters before it slowly stabilized.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes followed the figure and looked over. When they saw extremely miserable figure covered with fresh blood, the entire place immediately became silent. Quite a number of people inhaled a breath of cool air. This Killing Demon of the Profound Sky Sect had actually lost today!</p>
 <p>Dust gradually fell amid the silence of the entire square. A skinny figure slowly appeared. Numerous eyes looked over, only to see his clothes were still clean. He did not appear like someone who had undergone a big battle.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for conceding.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward Yi Chen in front of the many gazes and smiled as he thanked Yi Chen.</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>A green-faced Yi Chen finally spat out a mouthful of fresh blood at this moment. His pride had been completely shattered today.</p>
