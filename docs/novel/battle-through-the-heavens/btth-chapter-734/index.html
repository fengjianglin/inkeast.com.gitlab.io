 <p><strong><u>Chapter 734: Alliance</u></strong></p>
 <p>When the warm sunlight gradually covered the entire capital the next day, the entrance to the Xiao Mansion that was seated in the middle of the capital continuously received people from the few strongest factions within the capital. Many people could see the coat of arms that represented the various factions pausing by the entrance from a great distance. They had a feeling that a major change was about to happen within the Jia Ma Empire.</p>
 <p>The defense of the entire Xiao clan was unusually tight today. Any person not from the clan walking near it would immediately attract over a dozen eyes. If any person who arrived displayed even the slightest illegal activity, it was likely that that person would garner numerous attacks.</p>
 <p>There was a large Meeting Room that was positioned in the middle of the Xiao Mansion. Not many people could enter this place. There were a couple of people there, but they were equivalent to the strongest few factions within the Jia Ma Empire.</p>
 <p>However, the tension within the room was not as tense as expected. There were only a couple people that could enter into this room and they represented the largest factions within Jia Ma Empire.</p>
 <p>A black-robed, young man was seated in the leader’s seat within the hall. He would occasionally chat and laughing with Hai Bodong by his side. A cold pretty faced Medusa and Zi Yan, who was repeatedly looking all around, were seated on his left. Occasionally, some of the gazes in the hall would faintly sweep over this duo, one large and one small. Their gazes were filled with fear.</p>
 <p>Everyone had arrived after Xiao Yan had chatted with Hai Bodong for awhile. Only then did he cease chatting and slowly sweep his eyes over the entire room. His eyes immediately paused on the figure of a lady and an old man on one side of the circular table. He smiled and said, “It is unexpected that even Jia Lao and Princess Yao Ye have come today. You are really important guests.”</p>
 <p>Jia Xing Tian laughed upon hearing this, “Our imperial family naturally needs to come over and join the liveliness of such a big matter. We have come to look at how the future second generation ‘Misty Cloud Sect’ will be established in the Jia Ma Empire.” His gaze swept over Medusa and Zi Yan by Xiao Yan’s side when he spoke these words. A deep fear flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. He slowly stood up and looked over the entire room. The private conversations within the large hall were reduced under his gaze and many eyes gathered onto him.</p>
 <p>“Since everyone has been gathered, we shall begin to discuss some official matters.”</p>
 <p>Everyone hurriedly braced their attention upon hearing these words.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of air. He did not speak any nonsense and started on the main topic with a deep voice, “The Misty Cloud Sect has already disappeared from the Jia Ma Empire. Yun Shan’s wild ambition have also been destroyed with it. However, everyone should also know that the position of our Jia Ma Empire isn’t very high within the northwestern region of the continent. Although we have eliminated the big threat the Misty Cloud Sect posed, the position of our Jia Ma Empire will seriously decline because of this. Being the citizens of the Jia Ma Empire, I think that no one is willing to watch such a scene occur, right?”</p>
 <p>Everyone nodded slightly upon hearing this. However, their gazes were still placed on Xiao Yan. This kind of situation remained consistently like this since a long time ago. The Jia Ma Empire did not have a high position within the northwestern region. It even resulted in the people who had come from the Jia Ma Empire to receive unequal treatment outside. It was due to this that the business of the few large clans was ultimately restricted to the empire and was not released out. This was because they needed to retain their strength to protect themselves within the empire. Once they gained such an ability to guarantee their reputation outside of the empire. The few empires around them outside of the Jia Ma Empire refused to bother with them!</p>
 <p>“I think that everyone should be aware of some of my plans. The empire that possesses some strong factions within it would also raise the position of the country. However, now that the Misty Cloud Sect has disappeared, I, Xiao Yan, would like to establish an even stronger faction!” Xiao Yan’s gaze suddenly became stern as he spoke in a deep voice, “My hope in gathering everyone here today is for everyone to join this alliance. Your position and your benefits in the future will definitely be far from what you can compare with now.”</p>
 <p>The hall became slightly quiet when Xiao Yan’s voice sounded. It was a long while later before Mu Chen coughed softly and took the lead to speak, “Mister Xiao Yan’s intention seem to be trying to gather our few large clans together to form a single faction?”</p>
 <p>Other than Hai Bodong and Ya Fei, the other few clans nodded slightly after Mu Chen’s voice sounded. Although Xiao Yan’s hope was distant and great, the meaning of his words seem to be intending to get the few large clans to be under him. This point did not seem to be too different from the Misty Cloud Sect back then…</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, let me say these words. Third brother’s meaning is to invite everyone to join and form an alliance. This alliance would protect all the strengths of its members. As the saying goes, ‘glorious together and miserable together’. Speaking unceremoniously, the three large clans within the empire might indeed possess some strength within the Jia Ma Empire. However, in the northwestern region, they do not possess the qualification to say a word in the northwestern region. Your three large clans will definitely be stronger than any one time after such a merger. All of you would also be able to obtain quite a number of things from it.” Xiao Ding smiled slightly while he opened his mouth to softly speak.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s expressions became slightly warmer upon hearing Xiao Ding’s words, They immediately nodded. If this was true, they would not be without any good things by entering the so-called alliance. There would be nothing bad from it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding exchanged glances with one another. The latter laughed softly and said, “Once the alliance is established, we will create a hall that specializes in grooming experts for the alliance. It will help provide the alliance with a never-ending stream of new blood. All of you, being the members of the alliance, can recommend sending your outstanding younger generation to it. They will be able to receive the most perfect training and grooming there. The Qi Methods and Dou Techniques present there will be something that your clans will be unable to provide. Their achievements in the future will definitely exceed your earlier expectations.”</p>
 <p>The eyes of Mu Chen, Nalan Jie, and the others brightened upon hearing this. This welfare was something that would attract them.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, may I know what must we give up if we were to join?” Nalan Jie smiled and politely inquired.</p>
 <p>“Anyone who joins the alliance cannot concern itself only with itself in the future. Instead, it must view the alliance as a family and protect all its interest.” Xiao Ding spoke faintly. The words that he said were simple to utter but one had to give up a lot in order to commit to such words.</p>
 <p>Nalan Jie and the others were slightly startled upon hearing these words that Xiao Ding casually mentioned. Their faces immediately revealed some hesitation. They were naturally able to hear some meaning behind them. If they were to join the alliance, the structure of their clan would no longer exist. They must treat the alliance as a clan in the future and contribute all they could to it.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, the alliance does not belong to any single individual. It will have an Elder’s Council that will be the highest decision maker. Even the Alliance Head can only obey them. Now that we are just starting to establish it, every clan will be given a seat on the Elder’s Council for being the founding members. However, it will definitely not be so simple in the future.” Xiao Ding smiled as he explained.</p>
 <p>The hesitation on the faces of Nalan Jie and the others only weakened after hearing these words. They still had difficulty making an instant decision. After all, what they needed to contribute to was the entire clan.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, my Primer clan does not have any objections. Let me be the first Elder in this so-called Elder Council.” Hai Bodong laughed in a clear voice while everyone in the hall was hesitating.</p>
 <p>Everyone curled their mouth when they heard this. Your Primer clan is basically in the same boat as Xiao Yan. Would you lose out by joining the alliance?</p>
 <p>A cold and indifferent gaze suddenly swept over while everyone hesitated. Nalan Jie and the others appeared to have sensed some denseness within the gaze. Their hearts became slightly chilled as they raised their heads, only to see Medusa beside Xiao Yan staring at them.</p>
 <p>Their throats rolled slightly. The faces of Nalan Jie and the others became slightly pale. Only at this moment did they realize something. Given Xiao Yan’s current strength, it was already enough for him to forcefully get them to join the alliance. However, the latter did not choose to do this. Instead, he tried to persuade them with nice words and attract them with inducements. This was perhaps the greatest difference between him and Yun Shan.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how big the gap was, the two of them had something in common. That was that they both possessed a powerful faction that could easily destroy the few large clan. They always had the initiative in this kind of discussion.</p>
 <p>Mu Chen sighed quietly and laughed bitterly. He lifted his head and said, “Since Old Hai has agreed, our Mu clan also agrees to join the alliance. Hopefully, Mister Xiao Yan will treat our Mu clan well in the future.”</p>
 <p>“We are one family now that you have joined the alliance. Whoever dares to touch the Mu clan will have to get permission from me, Xiao Yan.” Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Nalan Jie also let out a bitter smile upon seeing that two of the three large clans had already joined. If he did not agree at such a moment, it was likely that their ending would not be good in the future. Originally, Xiao Yan did not have much of a favourable impression towards him. If they were to continue offending him, it was likely that...</p>
 <p>“Since that is the case, our Nalan clan will also agree to join…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also quietly sighed in relief after seeing that the three large clans had agreed. He also did not wish to use force unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze shifted away from Nalan Jie and the others before turning to the back of the Meeting Room toward Fa Ma, who had chosen to remain silent. He laughed faintly and asked, “Chairman Fa Ma, may I know your opinion?”</p>
 <p>Fa Ma laughed bitterly in his heart upon hearing Xiao Yan’s words. His turn had still arrived and he was really unable to escape…</p>
 <p>“Little friend Xiao Yan, our Alchemist Association is different from a clan. The association does not have any overly strict restrictions. There are many alchemists who are free. The Alchemist Association is unable to represent their choice. Hence…” Fa Ma sighed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. His gaze looked straight at Fa Ma. Even though he knew that the latter was telling the truth, he still did not intend to give up on the Alchemist Association. This was because this was the faction which he held in the highest regard. Hence, he had to get the alchemist association to enter the alliance no matter what. With these alchemist, the strength of the alliance would swiftly soar in the future!</p>
 <p>No matter how one put it, an alchemist was the most important and rarest occupation on the Dou Qi continent.</p>
 <p>Hence, he must not give up on the alchemist association!</p>
 <p>This was the most important objective among the many other plans!</p>
