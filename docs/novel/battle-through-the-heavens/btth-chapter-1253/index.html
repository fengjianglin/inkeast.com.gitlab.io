 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1253: Qing Lin?</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Humph, I have already chased this beast for a long time. You are the ones who are snatching it. Yet, you wish to hand it over to you now, isn’t that a joke?”</p>
 <p>That black shadow figure immediately laughed coldly upon hearing these words of Xiao Yan. Clearly, the figure was a woman. Moreover, it was likely that she was quite young.</p>
 <p>“Just where did this woman come from? She already possessed such a mysterious tactic at such an age. There isn’t any word of such a young and outstanding person in the Central Plains.” Xiao Yan’s expression was gloomy. A thought swiftly flew within his heart. However, he was still without any conclusion a moment later. At the end, he could only attribute it to there being too many hidden experts within the Central Plains.</p>
 <p>“Woman, you are really shameless. The things here belongs to no one. Would it not be a joke to say it belongs to whoever set sight on it first? If you have the ability, you should release the Pill Beast and see just which side it will run towards!” Zi Yan cried out.</p>
 <p>That black shadow person softly snorted in the face of Zi Yans’ cry. However, her hands that were grabbing onto the pill beast did not relax even a little. She was naturally aware that if she let this little fellow go, it will definitely flee towards the other side.</p>
 <p>“I will not hand over the Pill Beast. If you wish to fight, you can just attack…”</p>
 <p>A pair of eyes emitting a bright green light swept over the place from under the ghost mask. Finally, they paused on Xiao Yan’s gloomy face. For some unknown reason, this unusually strong young man gave her a kind of strange feeling. That feeling was as though she was once acquainted with him.</p>
 <p>She knitted her brows and thought about it but was unable to recall anything at this moment. All she could do was to suppress it in her heart. Her eyes swept all over the place in an attempt to find a spot where she could escape from the encirclement.</p>
 <p>A chillness flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he saw this black shadow figure did not show any signs of giving up. This Pill Beast was far too rare and important. If he could obtain it and groom it properly, it might really possess the opportunity to advance into the legendary tier 9 level. At that time, it would definitely enable his strength to soar greatly. Even surpass the Tianzun of the Hall of Soul would be an ordinary thing.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do not blame us for relying on our larger numbers.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly stepped forward. Purple-brown flame spread out like a furious dragon, covering his body. His foot suddenly stomped on the ground and his body appeared in front of the black shadow figure in a lightning like manner. Hot sharp palm wind directly smashed violently towards the latter’s head.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>The black shadow person also let out a cold snort when she saw Xiao Yan attack. Her footsteps pulled back in an agile manner and she dodge the palm wind. A green glow suddenly flashed from under the ghost mask.</p>
 <p>“The one who relies on a larger number of people is likely me!”</p>
 <p>The cold cry of the black shadow person sounded and the space in front of her immediately became distorted. Immediately, over a dozen figures appeared from out of nowhere. They let out a furious cry in usion. Over a dozen incomparably fierce wind smashed towards Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>A caution rose within Xiao Yan’s heart when the green glow of the black shadow person appeared. Hence, he might be surprised when these human figures suddenly appeared but he did not panic. His body flashed in a ghost like manner and dodged the palm wind that came flying from all directions. However, he had also took a couple of steps back as a result.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stabilized his body. He raised his head and looked at the dozen over black clothed figures standing in the midair. His eyebrows were involuntarily knitted. The aura of these people were extremely strong. Those two leading black robed elders had even reached the Dou Zun class. Those behind were all experts at the peak of the Dou Zong class. By placing these people together, just their numbers alone would far exceed Xiao Yan’s group.</p>
 <p>“Most of these people are experts from the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribes…” Zi Yan spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. There was a little fear within his eyes as he looked at the black shadow person. This person was actually really able to completely control these experts. Moreover, she was even able to use this kind of mysterious spatial method to carry these controlled experts with her. That manner was completely like a movable guard warehouse.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes carefully looked at these experts a short distance in front of him. He discovered that there was still some remnant consciousness within their eyes. However, from the looks of their manner, it appeared that their bodies were already completely being controlled.</p>
 <p>“This woman has controlled their bodies but they still possess their own consciousness. What a strange technique…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was cold when he discovered this scene. Originally, he thought that this woman had used some method to refine puppets and refine these experts. However, from the looks of this current situation, it seemed that she had directly controlled the bodies of these people. Moreover, she had even sealed their souls within their bodies. These techniques were not only mysterious but it was also not as complicated as refining a puppet. These various situation caused the caution within Xiao Yan’s heart to become increasingly deep.</p>
 <p>Although he felt a fear, he must still obtain the Pill Beast. This kind of thing was too rare. Even with Xiao Yan’s calmness, he was unable to resist its allure. Moreover, two Dou Zuns and over a dozen peak Dou Zongs were unable to deter and force him back.</p>
 <p>“Do you need us to attack?” Little Fairy Doctor frowned slightly and asked when she saw the black shadow person summoning so many experts.</p>
 <p>“There is no need. All of you should guard the surroundings. Do not allow anyone in and do not give her an opportunity to escape.” Xiao Yan shook his head. He waved his hand and the Sky Demon Puppet as well as the ten Earth Demon Puppet appeared. An order was issued within his heart and the glow on these eleven puppets surged. It charged forward without fearing death adn collided violently with that group of expert.</p>
 <p>“I want to see just what other methods you have!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression had become icy cold after he blocked these experts. A silver glow flashed under his feet and he appeared in front of the black shadow person in a lightning like fashion. Surging hot wind suddenly rushed over like a storm.</p>
 <p>That black shadow person did not dare to slight this swift attack by Xiao Yan. After exchanging blows, she understood that the former’s Dou Qi was extremely strange. Once it invaded his body, there would definitely be quite a great amount of trouble. Currently, she was injured. If she was to suffer another devastating blow, it was likely that she could only withdraw.</p>
 <p>A thought flew within the black shadow person’s mind. His footsteps also swiftly pulled back. A moment later, he finally had nowhere to withdraw to. Both of his hands were placed together and it formed some strange seals in a lightning like fashion.</p>
 <p>“Soul Snatching!”</p>
 <p>A cold cry was being emitted from the mouth of the black shadow person. A bright green light immediately shot out and shone onto Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was cold when the green glow was shot over. Purple-brown flame hurried covered his body. Even though this was the case, Xiao Yan suddenly sensed that the soul between his brows had suddenly leaped when the green light shot onto his body. It was as though it was about to leave his body.</p>
 <p>This unexpected change had caused Xiao Yan’s heart to be greatly startled. He hurriedly suppressed his soul and forcefully controlled the kind of unusual restlessness.</p>
 <p>“What a mysterious demonic skill!”</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan had suppressed his soul, he had began to feel a little chilly in the face of these tactics by this woman. He could be considered to have experienced quite a number of opponents during these years. However, he had never seen one so mysterious.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s fist violently smashed onto the empty space after he had suppressed his soul. A frightening wind penetrated through the space and landed heavily on the black shadow figures. However, the latter’s body clearly had a green light flashing over it when she was about to be struck. Over half the force was blocked.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>The strength of this punch from Xiao Yan had been reduced by more than half. The remaining strength continued to frighten that black shadow person until he hurriedly withdrew. A couple of cross-beams ended up breaking apart from colliding with the figure.</p>
 <p>“Hand the Pill Beast over!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was icy cold after forcing back the black shadow person with a punch. He quickly gave chase. How fist wind erupted at this moment and covered all of the fatal spots around the black shadow person’s body.</p>
 <p>“In your dreams!”</p>
 <p>Although the black shadow person was being continuously defeated, she was also quite stubborn. Green light flashed. The Pill Beast in her hand strangely disappeared. Immediately, her hands hurriedly changed the seals it formed and waves after waves of bright green light rushed out from the ghost mask in all directions.</p>
 <p>“Demon Eye Body Control!”</p>
 <p>Green light erupted. Immediately, the mask of the black shadow person became distorted. An instant later, it actually formed a face size green eye. This was an extremely demonic and mysterious eye. Three green small snakes were lingering within it. Each of their heads were connected to another’s tail as they encircled around the eye. As they swiftly rotated, waves after waves of mysterious energy was immediately scattered from it.</p>
 <p>The moment that the green demon eye appeared, Xiao Yan suddenly sensed that his body had suddenly stiffened. It was as though his control over his body had strangely disappeared at this moment.</p>
 <p>This kind of unexpected change caused Xiao Yan’s heart to be greatly startled. Fortunately, he did not panic. With his ability, he need not need to rely on his body in order to attack. A thought passed through his mind and the vast and mighty Spiritual Strength within his brows spread. It agglomerated into a somewhat illusory human figure in the midair in front of him. The fist of the human figure moved and a punch was thrown forward violently.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>Vast and mighty Spiritual Strength formed a spiritual hand seal on Xiao Yan’s ghost fist. After which, it suddenly rushed out and landed heavily on the demonic eye.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A fist smashed onto the demonic eye and the demonic eye trembled intensely. Finally, it slowly disappeared. The remanent strength also violently poured onto the black human figure’s ghost mask.</p>
 <p>The heavy attack by this Spiritual Strength directly sent the black shadow figure flying out. Finally, she smashed heavily onto the hard wall of the Pill Room.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face was dark and solemn. His body moved and appeared in front of the black shadow person. He clenched his fist and the heavy ruler appeared. After which, it paused onto the latter’s throat. An icy cold voice appeared, “Are you going to hand over the Pill Beast now?”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>The black shadow person rubbed the blood trace from the corner of her mouth. She stubbornly raised her head, stared furiously at Xiao Yan in front of her and spoke with gritting teeth.</p>
 <p>A fury rose within Xiao Yan’s heart when he heard this. He turned his eyes and was about to cry out furiously when he became startled.</p>
 <p>Under the ghost mask was an exquisite melon shape face. However, this small face was covered by a kind of stubborn expression. Of course, the thing that caught Xiao Yan’s attention was not this but the pair of eyes belonging to the girl.</p>
 <p>It was a pair of completely green beautiful eyes. However, deep within the eyes were three green coloured small spots. They surrounded the eyes and rotated slowly, filling it with a kind of demonic and mysterious feeling.</p>
 <p>“Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan instantly inhaled a breath of cool air as he looked at this pair of eyes. His gaze suddenly turned towards the exquisite face. A kind of familiar feeling suddenly appeared at this instant. An exclamation of disbelief involuntarily escaped from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“You… Qing Lin?”</p>
