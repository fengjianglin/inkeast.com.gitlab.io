 <p><strong><u>Chapter 830: Trouble That Comes Knocking At the Door</u></strong></p>
 <p>Being able to be the place where experts and the leaders from the many factions were settled by the Black Emperor Sect, the Black Emperor Pavilion was unusually luxurious. Xiao Yan’s group clicked their tongues and praised when they entered through its incomparably large door and looked into the spacious arena-sized hall. This Black Emperor Sect could really afford to spend.</p>
 <p>The hall of the current Black Emperor Pavilion was extremely noisy and lively. There were quite a number of human figures sitting in scattered groups. Great attention was given to the spots where these people sat. Only familiar people and those belonging to the same factions would cluster together. Some of those people seating on individual tables were the lone warriors that roamed the ‘Black-Corner Region’. The strength of these kinds of people were usually quite strong. Their characters were also a little eccentric. It was a common matter for them to draw their weapons and face each other should they have a disagreement.</p>
 <p>The unique characteristic of the ‘Black-Corner Region’ was chaos. This point was not the least bit diminished even in this Black Emperor Pavilion. Due to this place having gathered most of the experts and factions in the ‘Black-Corner Region’, it was unavoidable that there would be some enemies among these people. Therefore, it was only natural that conflicts would erupt once these people met. The most effective method in resolving a conflict was to openly fight each other. Therefore, one would occasionally be able to hear the clear sound of metal colliding with metal in this incomparably large hall. These people might be fighting, but it was clear that they still held some reasoning and knew whose place this belonged to. No one would be bothered about a small fight or argument. However, if the matter escalated until the point where the building would be torn down or worse, it was likely that those Black Emperor Sect’s experts who were hiding in the shadows would immediately intervene.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s three man group stood at the entrance and studied the hall where fierce bloody battles would occasionally occur. They involuntarily shook their heads after hearing the waves of cheers from the surrounding observers who were enjoying the show. This ‘Black-Corner Region’ really did not have the semblance of a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
 <p>A pretty female servant quickly walked over not long after Xiao Yan’s group entered the Black Emperor Pavilion. She bowed and received the tablet that the three of them had obtained. She inspected it before informing the three of them about the location of their room with a smile.</p>
 <p>This Black Demon Pavilion was extremely large and could accommodate thousands of people. The location where people would reside was divided into three categories, Sky, Earth, and Human based on their strength or the factions behind them. The area where Xiao Yan’s group stayed was neither high nor low. It was the Earth area.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about such division. From the way he looked at it, it was sufficient as long as he was provided with a chamber to refine medicinal pills without being disturbed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was not in a hurry to return to his room since it was still early. Hence, he rejected the offer of the female servant to lead them to their room. He dismissed her before leading the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan, whose face was filled with excitement from the lively atmosphere around, slowly through the incomparably large hall.</p>
 <p>The three of them passed through this large noisy hall before finding a table beside a window where they could sit down. One could coincidentally see the lush green woods outside from this spot. A cool breeze blew over and caused the noisiness that lingered beside their ears to become much fainter.</p>
 <p>The three of them had just sat down when a female servant delivered tea in an extremely respectful manner. Such service was really flawless. It appeared that the Black Emperor Sect had put in quite a lot of effort for these experts who came from all over the ‘Black-Corner Region’.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sat in a chair and lifted his teacup. However, his heart was repeatedly recalling the gray-robed person whom he had saw earlier. Due to the gray robe covering that person, Xiao Yan was unable to clearly see even a little of his appearance. The reason why he was able to feel a vaguely familiar feeling could only be attributed to his sensitive Spiritual Perception.</p>
 <p>“The aura of that person from earlier is extremely strange. Although it seems extremely weak, one could sense a thread of an unusual aura if one were to carefully feel for it. I have never felt this kind of feeling before. At the very least, I can tell that that gray-robed person is definitely not an ordinary person like he appears on the surface.” The Little Fairy Doctor softly spoke. She appeared to know what Xiao Yan was thinking in her heart while she observed Xiao Yan, who was frowning in deep thought.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan vaguely nodded. He had similarly sensed that that gray-robed person was a little too unusual. However, he was unable to recall just who among those whom he had met had given him this kind of foreign yet familiar feeling no matter how he tried to remember. Moreover, under the scanning of his Spiritual Strength, he actually had some difficulty sensing the strength of the other party’s spirit. This kind of feeling was just like an obscure fog that covered everything.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan thought deeply for a long time, but still gained no clues. He could only sigh as quietly said to himself, “Perhaps I was mistaken.”</p>
 <p>After comforting himself in his heart, Xiao Yan finally suppressed this matter. He withdrew his thoughts. He chatted and smiled with the Little Fairy Doctor while paying attention to the noisy, large hall at the same time. Although this place was noisy and filled with people, it was the kind of place he would be able to obtain the information he needed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did indeed hear quite a bit of information by eavesdropping. For example, other than the Demon Flame Valley, there was some other extremely old factions among the many large factions who had come to this auction. Some of the factions outside of the ‘Black-Corner Region’ also received some information and had dispatched experts to hurry to the ‘Black-Corner Region’. While Xiao Yan was doing this, he had also heard of an extremely familiar faction: ‘Xiao Gate.’</p>
 <p>Even with Xiao Yan’s calmness, he was stunned for quite awhile after hearing its name for the first time. He involuntarily let out a smile. It was unexpected that the faction he had established by chance would actually advance to a first rate faction under his second brother’s development and the support of the Jia Nan Academy. Through this, it also ended up possessing the qualification to participate in this kind of large-scale auction.</p>
 <p>“If the ‘Xiao Gate’ is also participating in this auction, it is likely that they should also be residing in the Black Demon Pavilion.” Xiao Yan muttered in his heart. He did not immediately plan to go and search for them. Currently, experts had gathered like clouds within the Black Emperor City. Although ‘Xiao Gate’ was developing extremely quickly, its foundation could not be compared with these ancient factions. Hence, keeping a low profile was a good thing. Moreover if he was hidden in the shadows, he would be able to lend an unexpected hand should any accidents happen to the ‘Xiao Gate.’</p>
 <p>Most of what Xiao Yan heard while he listened was information pertaining the ‘Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva’. It seemed that this thing was an advertisement that did not cost much. Other than Xiao Yan and a couple of others, most of the people knew that the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva would be one of the most sought after treasures in this large-scale auction.</p>
 <p>Most of the people’s tones were filled with a wild heat when they mentioned the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, much less the natural spiritual object, the Bodhisattva Heart. Just a simple Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was able to cause quite a number of people to become jealous. After all, as long as one consumed this thing, one would be able to improve his constitution. This improvement in constitution had quite a great allure to everyone. No one would expect that Xiao Yan’s body had already reached a point where there was no need for any improvement.</p>
 <p>“It seems we were really slow in learning this. The things that we are unable to find for a long time extremely common knowledge here.” Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his thoughts before sighing to the Little Fairy Doctor and Zu Yan. In order to obtain this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, they had spent around half a year on the long journey from the Chu Yun Empire to the ‘Black-Corner Region’ only to receive nothing. However, almost everyone knew what the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was in this place.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor also slightly smiled after hearing this. She immediately said, “There are still three days until the auction begins. It is likely that there will be even more factions and experts rushing over to the Black Emperor City during these three days. This ‘Black-Corner Region’ is not a place that the Chu Yun Empire or the Jia Ma Empire can compare with. The number of experts is so far apart.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. The ‘Black-Corner Region’ was close to the middle of the Dou Qi continent. Due to the special atmosphere of this place, a countless number of stolen items appeared here. Those things would be difficult to auction outside of this region. By being carried by the ability to exchange such things, this ‘Black-Corner Region’ was naturally not what those areas near the desolated areas like the Jia Ma Empire and Chu Yun Empire could compare with.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, it’s quite late already. We will rest for one night. Tomorrow, I will begin to refine some medicinal pills that we can take out. Otherwise, what will we use to compete with those people in the auction?” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept to the window to check the weather outside before placing down the teacup in his hand. He suggested with a smile to them.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” The Little Fairy Doctor nodded.</p>
 <p>The three of them stood up from their table. They were just about to turn around when the hall suddenly became chaotic. After which, a big group of large men with faces filled with ill intent walked toward them in a fierce manner.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan frowned and glanced at those large men only to find a wolf tattoo. He was slightly startled. It seemed that the ten plus people whom he had randomly finished off back at the entrance of the city also possessed this kind of marking.</p>
 <p>“Looks like there will be some slight trouble.” The Little Fairy Doctor glanced over and carelessly spoke.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. Since the other party had already come looking for him, he was in no hurry to leave. He sat back into his chair amid numerous surprised gazes. His eyes were calm as they watched the group of large men surge over. There were many experts within this Black Emperor Pavilion. It was a good thing to keep a low profile. However, continuously dodging would invite even more trouble. This time around, it might be a good chance to kill the main party and silence the others.</p>
 <p>The group of large men with fierce auras naturally attracted quite a number of eyes from those in the hall. Some immediately emitted surprised gasps.</p>
 <p>“What? It is unexpected that even Kui Sha and that fellow have come to the Black Emperor City. It was rumored that a one star Dou Huang was killed by this fellow not long ago.”</p>
 <p>“The Kui Wolf gang are all ruthless. I don’t know how that brat offended them, but it is likely that he will experience some hardship today.”</p>
 <p>The large shirtless men filled with a fierce aura, like a bloodthirsty wolf, came to the side of Xiao Yan’s group’s table under the focus of many eyes.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A large leg was violently swung over and smashed the table where the three of them were located. Wood splinters flew. The middle-aged man whose face had a couple scars was an exceptionally gloomy person. His eyes were like knives as they swept over Xiao Yan before a dense voice resounded over this region of the hall.</p>
 <p>“Little bastard. Are you the one who killed someone from my Kui Wolf Gang back at the city’s entrance?”</p>
