 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1320: Third Commander Yang Hao</u></strong></p>
 <p>The loud cry reverberated within the building, causing the noisy atmosphere to immediately quiet down. These two people were quite well-known. One was the third commander of the Gu clan’s Black Submerged Army while the other was the Pill Gathering champion. The both of them were outstanding people within the younger generation. Could the observers be lucky enough to watch them spar here today?</p>
 <p>Excitement surged in quite a number of people’s eyes when they thought of this. Their gazes swept around them in an attempt to find the two of them.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor’s group was also startled because of this sudden unexpected change. They saw Xiao Yan’s gloomy expression and immediately understood something. They frowned and said, “It is unexpected that trouble has come knocking on the door after having just talked about it. This is really a little too underhanded.”</p>
 <p>With their intelligence, they naturally understood that the other party was afraid of Xiao Yan backing away, explaining why he had publicly acted before seeking permission. If Xiao Yan were to lose this match, it was likely that it would become an excuse for the Gu clan to strike against Xiao Yan. Even Xun Er would be implicated by this.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was gloomy. He slowly exhaled a breath of air and gradually placed his teacup down. He softly said, “It’s just as well. I do not like this kind of continuous trouble. It will not be bad if I kill a chicken to warn those monkeys before entering the Gu clan. Since he willingly wishes to become this chicken, I shall accept his offer…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suddenly turned his head after uttering these words. His icy gaze shot to the green-clothed man on the upper floor.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, his senses are quite sharp…” That green-clothed man laughed when he saw Xiao Yan looking over. His expression did not reveal the slightest fear. His strength was at the peak of the five star Dou Zun class. Although Xiao Yan was also a five star Dou Zun, this green-clothed young man had seldom been defeated when fighting an opponent of the same level.</p>
 <p>“Yang Hao, you should not act recklessly. If the Elders become aware of this…” The fifth commander by the side frowned as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“We are only sparing. Our Gu clan has always been more inclined to fight. Isn’t it good to find friends through sparing?” Yang Hao laughed faintly and continued, “Relax, I will not allow him to lose in an ugly way… of course this is only if he is tactful.”</p>
 <p>After his words softly sounded, Yang Hao’s body flashed, and he appeared on the stone stage before the fifth commander could say anything more. He smiled as he looked in the direction of Xiao Yan. He laughed and said, “Mister Xiao Yan, I have long heard of your great name. May I know if I can seek some lessons from you today?”</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>All the gazes in the building suddenly turned at this moment. They gathered on the skinny figure beside a window.</p>
 <p>“He is that Xiao Yan? The Pill Gathering champion?”</p>
 <p>“He looks quite young. It is unexpected that he has reached the level of a tier 8 alchemist at such an age. It is really difficult to believe.”</p>
 <p>“It is rumored that his teacher is Yao Chen, Yao zun-zhe from back then. However, the current Yao Chen has already advanced to a Ban Sheng. His strength is so great that it is frightening…”</p>
 <p>“No wonder… Yao Chen has sharp eyes. This current disciple is many times stronger than Han Feng from back then.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was calm as he heard the private conversations around him. He turned his head and threw his eyes at the young green-clothed man on the stage with a dark smile on his face. He slowly stood up and said, “Since third commander insists on this, I shall not reject your offer.”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s brows were lifted slightly when he saw that Xiao Yan did not find an excuse to reject him. However, the smile on his face became denser. He did an ‘after you’ gesture. However, no one saw the dense chill flashing through his eyes when he bowed to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Be careful.”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor’s group did not stop him. They were confident in Xiao Yan’s strength. That Yang Hao’s strength might be at the peak of a five star Dou Zun, but this kind of strength did not pose any fatal threat to the current Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Aye.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He strode forward and the space in front of him became distorted. The next moment, he appeared a short distance away from Yang Hao.</p>
 <p>“You are indeed worthy of being the champion of a Pill Gathering. This courage is really admirable.” Yang Hao grinned as he looked at Xiao Yan and complimented him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was calm as he glanced at the superficial smile on Yang Hao’s face. His voice tranquil, to the extent of lacking emotion, “After you.”</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao loudly laughed. He suddenly took a step forward. A vast and mighty Dou Qi immediately surged in all directions. The powerful Dou Qi pressure caused the expressions of quite a number of people within the building to change.</p>
 <p>“Today, this commander shall personally test and see just how outstanding this Pill Gathering champion is!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao loudly laughed as his Dou Qi surged. His long hand was suddenly clenched, and a sharp wind was formed within his palm. His foot stomped on the ground, and his body appeared in front of Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed. A sharp claw wind violently rushed toward Xiao Yan like a dragnet. The sharp force tore through space, forming numerous dark black scars.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stepped back when faced with Yang Hao’s ferocious attack. He began to use a mysterious footwork within a three step radius and dodged Yang Hao’s dense claw wind.</p>
 <p>“What a fast speed. However, come and try my Dragon Snake Footwork!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao was startled when he saw Xiao Yan completely dodge his attack. He immediately let out a cold cry. He took a step forward. With the step of a dragon and tiger, his body became ghost-like and a dragon-snake illusory figure vaguely appeared behind him. The Gu clan did not lack high class Dou Skills. Moreover, being the third commander, the Dou Skills that Yang Hao had learned were definitely not ordinary. This Dragon Snake Footwork alone was not inferior to Xiao Yan’s Three Thousand Lightning Movement.”</p>
 <p>“Sky Evil Qi Shattering Claw!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s speed suddenly increased after using this Dragon Snake Footwork. His claw wind suddenly changed as a fierce evil aura quickly gathered on his palm. The space where his palm passed cracked apart, and a deafening buzzing sound spread in a sharp manner.</p>
 <p>“The Gu clan is indeed a large clan. These high class Dou Skills that are difficult to see in the outside world are being used as he pleases!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed when he sensed that Yang Hao’s speed and attack had suddenly become sharper. By possessing so many high class Dou Skills to protect himself with, it was little wonder that this fellow was not worried about defeating Xiao Yan, who was also a five star Dou Zun. However, he had miscalculated. In front of Xiao Yan, who possessed an unusually powerful Spiritual Strength, any ghost-like agility techniques could not escape his eyes!</p>
 <p>“Bam bam!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeve and would accurately strike Yang Hao’s claw wind just when it was about to reach its target. This moment was coincidentally the moment when the claw wind was going from weak to strong. However, one would be unable to take advantage of such an opening without a perfect observation ability.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s expression gained a solemness each time they exchanged blows. After over a dozen sharp exchanges, his expression had been replaced by a grave one. Although he had used two types of Di class middle level Dou Skills, he was unable to harm Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan’s movements of leisure caused him to feel that he was losing face.</p>
 <p>“I do not believe that a poor brat like you can compete with this commander in terms of the amount and quality of skills that you possess!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s expression was dark and cold. His feet suddenly pulled back. At the same time, his hands started to form numerous seals that Xiao Yan was unusually familiar with.</p>
 <p>“God Seal Skill, huh…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes when he saw the seals. His body flashed and strangely appeared in front of Yang Hao. He flicked his finger and a gentle breeze shot out, striking Yang Hao’s wrist with lightning-like speed. This breeze might not be strong, but it interrupted the completion of the God Seal Skill, causing the blood within Yang Hao’s body to churn.</p>
 <p>“This brat. Why is he aware of the flaws of the God Seal Skill?”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s expression changed when Xiao Yan randomly broke the seal that he had been forming. Before he could think, a hot wind came blew over, and he had to hurriedly receive it.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The hot wind spread across the stone stage. Everyone was stunned to see Yang Hao stagger a couple of steps back because of Xiao Yan’s punch. Yang Hao was in a situation where Xiao Yan had completely overwhelmed him.</p>
 <p>The originally dark and cold face of Ling Quan on the upper floor had become a little ugly. He vaguely began to feel an unease growing.</p>
 <p>“Yang Hao is no match for him!” The fifth commander also displayed a serious expression. Xiao Yan appeared unruffled even in the face of Yang Hao’s skills, causing him to involuntarily feel a little slump in his heart. This fellow was indeed not a mediocre person by being able to catch the eye of young miss…</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao’s face became flushed red after being forced back by Xiao Yan’s palm. Clearly, he did not understand why he was unable to defeat Xiao Yan with his strength at the peak of the five star Dou Zun class. Moreover, he had even used many powerful Dou Skills. On the other hand, Xiao Yan had yet to use one Dou Skill even until now.</p>
 <p>“Overturning Land Seal!”</p>
 <p>A ferociousness vaguely surfaced on Yang Hao’s face. He unleashed his Dragon Snake Footwork to its limit. A dragon-snake illusory figure appeared on the stone stage while the seal on his hand was swiftly formed. A vast and mighty Dou Qi quickly gathered.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood on the stage with his hands behind him. His eyes were calm as he watched the blurry figure that was swiftly shuffling around before slowly shutting his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Successful formation!”</p>
 <p>The ferocious on Yang Hao’s face became even more intense when he saw what Xiao Yan was doing. His hand seals suddenly paused. A cold expression surfaced from within his eyes. However, a chill covered his heart when the seal in his hand was about to launch toward Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The moment the chill appeared, the stone stage under his feet suddenly cracked apart. A hot magma pillar bared its claws and rushed out like a fire dragon. It smashed into Yang Hao’s legs.</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>The attack that was unleashed from underground had exceeded everyone’s expectations. Being the main actor, Yang Hao spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and his body was struck by the fire pillar until he flew. Finally, he smashed into a large stone pillar of the building. The stone pillar was immediately blasted apart.</p>
 <p>The entire place was completely silent as everyone watched this battle end in an instant. Numerous stunned eyes looked at the skinny young man with his hands behind him. His body had not even shifted. A moment later, a thunder-like applause resonated through the entire building in a deafening manner.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression remained tranquil. He studied the charred-black Yang Hao before cupping his hands together. He smiled and said, “Thank you for going easy, third commander.”</p>
 <p>“Grug!”</p>
 <p>Yang Hao, who had just landed on the ground, involuntarily spat out another mouthful of fresh blood. He had never expected to be miserably defeated by Xiao Yan’s hands with his peak of a five star Dou Zun strength…</p>
