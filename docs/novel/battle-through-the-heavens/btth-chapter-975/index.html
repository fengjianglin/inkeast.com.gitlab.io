 <p><strong><u>Chapter 975: Qingfeng Mountains</u></strong></p>
 <p>Enormous trees rose into the sky within a lush green mountain range. These large trees, that had grown for hundreds or thousands of years, were usually able to grow to a height of a couple hundred meters tall. They were the largest living beings in the mountain range. Even sunlight was blocked by their huge leaves. Hardly anyone was present in this place. Occasionally, the roar of a Magical Beast would appear, frightening off the many birds resting in the forest. The panicked fluttering of wings would form a white figure that spread over the sky, appearing majestic.</p>
 <p>There was a tall mountain peak that jutted into the sky within the vast mountain range. The mountain peak was not very large, but it was extremely steep. Its walls were nearly vertical, and its precipitous mountain peak was extremely smooth. Unless it could fly, an ordinary Magical Beast would have difficulty ascending it.</p>
 <p>Clouds lingered over the peak of the mountain while a young man sat cross-legged on it. A silver-colored human figure was sitting straight beside the young man. The figure’s body did not move even a little while it's empty-hole-like eyes slowly swept around him. It would instantly kills anything that approached the mountain peak regardless of whether it was a person or Magical Beast, acting like the perfect bodyguard.</p>
 <p>The young man maintained this posture for around two hours before he slowly opened his eyes. His somewhat pale-white face gradually recovered a little redness.</p>
 <p>“Little fellow, your strength is too weak. However, it is fortunate that your body is tough. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to endure the pouring of my Spiritual Strength.” A laughter sounded within Xiao Yan’s heart when he opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grinned and asked, “Old mister Yao, what level has your strength recovered to?”</p>
 <p>“Around that of an eight star Dou Zong. Any increase in the future will be extremely difficult. Any attempt to return to the Dou Zun class will require a physical body that would fit my spirit extremely well.” Tian Huo zun-zhe mused for a moment before laughing somewhat cunningly, “Hee hee, however, little fellow, we agreed earlier that you would help the old me resolve the matter of a physical body.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled involuntarily when he heard this. Tian Huo zun-zhe was a great help. If Xiao Yan could allow him to recover to the strength of a Dou Zun, it would definitely be beneficial for him. On this point, Xiao Yan would naturally lend a hand without holding back.</p>
 <p>“The original body has the most perfect degree of fitting with one’s soul. If a soul were to randomly occupy a physical body, it is likely that the effects would be quite poor. Hence, a body can only be specifically refined…” Xiao Yan softly explained. Yao Lao had once mentioned to Xiao Yan the method to refine a body. Hence, as long as Xiao Yan found the necessary ingredients, he should be able to refine one with his current level.</p>
 <p>“I shall leave the matter of the refinement to you. Remember, you must make the best one for the old me. Don’t cut corners. Although I have never refined a body, I am also aware that the strength of the ingredients is very important. It will also determine one’s achievement in the future.” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed.</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, please rest assured that Xiao Yan will definitely help you refine the best body.” Xiao Yan beamed as he replied.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, it’s best if this is the case. Little fellow, you can rest assured that the old me will not let you fall into any danger of losing your life before you refine the body for me.” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed out loud. His heart did indeed feel a gratitude to Xiao Yan. If Xiao Yan hadn't brought him out from that magma world, it was likely that he would have long since turned into nothingness. How could he possess his current grandness then? Moreover, he might even possess his own body in the future and once again have the wonderful feeling of being ‘human.’</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard these words. With this expert protecting him, he would be in possession of quite a large amount of capital that would allow him to feel extremely safe when roaming the Central Plains.</p>
 <p>“However, even with this talisman, raising his own strength was still the most important matter. After all, he could not borrow the strength of others all the time…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment as a smile formed. He moved his hand and an emerald-like jade bottle appeared in his hand. He tilted the bottle and a medicinal pill the size of a dragon’s eye rolled out. Immediately, an unusual fragrance scattered, commanding everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>This medicinal pill was naturally the Mighty Huang Pill. Moreover, it was the best quality pill among those Mighty Huang Pills that Xiao Yan had refined. He did not take it out to be auctioned. Instead, he had kept it in preparation for his own use. Now, it was coincidentally able to come in handy.</p>
 <p>The use of the Mighty Huang Pill was able to let an elite Dou Huang raise his strength by one or even two stars. However, this also depended on luck. Something like one’s strength not even raising after consuming the Mighty Huang Pill had happened before. Moreover, the unlucky thing was that even if they failed, this thing would similarly no longer possess any effect when they consumed it a second time. Hence, the people who consumed the Mighty Huang Pill would usually pray in their hearts that they would not end up meeting such an unlucky incident…</p>
 <p>The medicinal pill slowly rolled on Xiao Yan’s hand. A moment later, he gently exhaled a breath, widened his mouth, and swiftly stuffed the medicinal pill into it.</p>
 <p>The Mighty Huang Pill immediately melted upon entering Xiao Yan’s mouth, transforming into a somewhat warm, powerful medicinal strength that wildly surged into Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>Following the surging in of the great amount of pure medicinal strength, the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth also twitched. It was fortunate that his veins were tough. Otherwise, he would have difficulty consuming such a large amount of medicinal strength in one go.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of air when the medicinal strength swiftly surged and flowed into all his veins. A thought passed through his mind and the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame surged around his body. Immediately, the flames charged into his veins and swiftly wrapped around the enormous medicinal strength. After which, it forcefully pulled this wild horse like fellow. Following the route of the Flame Mantra Qi Method, it slowly began to circulate.</p>
 <p>The space around Xiao Yan in the outside world began to ripple intensely when the medicinal strength surged within Xiao Yan’s body. Wave after wave of energy appeared before agglomerating into an energy swirl in the space above his head. Finally, the energy slowly seeped into him through the top of his head…</p>
 <p>Being in possession of a ‘Heavenly Flame’ made refining the mottled energy from nature an easy matter for Xiao Yan. He was able to refine whatever came regardless of the quantity involved.</p>
 <p>Everything slowly came on track, following the gradual activation of the medicinal strength within his body. The medicinal strength of the Mighty Huang Pill might be great, but it was insufficient to cause the current Xiao Yan to feel any panic with his current ability. Everything proceeded extremely smoothly. Whether the Mighty Huang Pill was able to raise Xiao Yan’s strength by one or two stars would depend on the results when the time came…</p>
 <p>The mountain peak had become quiet after Xiao Yan entered into a slow refining state. Only the Earth Demon Puppet beside him continued its sentry duty…</p>
 <p>The Qifeng Mountains were quite renowned within the northern region of the Central Plains. The reason was not because there was a Phoenix within it. Instead, this was the place where the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion stood.</p>
 <p>The Wind Lightning Pavilion was divided into the north, south, east, and west pavilions. The north, south, and west were complementary branches while the east pavilion was the strongest. Even though this was the case, any one of the three pavilions possessed the qualification to be ranked among the top tier factions within the Central Plains. The union of the four pavilions was comparable to some of the factions at the peak, and it was called the giant of the northern regions of the Central Plains for that reason.</p>
 <p>Qifeng Mountains were extremely arduous in nature. The precipitous mountain peaks were covered in a layer of fog that left one with a paradise-like feeling.</p>
 <p>The peak of Qifeng Mountain seemed to have been hacked into two by an enormous axe. There were numerous partially visible buildings hidden within the lush greenery. The most eye-catching part of the entire mountain peak was the enormous silver-colored pagoda that was located on the highest peak.</p>
 <p>This enormous pagoda, that rushed into the sky, was named North Lightning Tower. Its body was covered by a bright-silver color. One could faintly hear the slight sound of rumbling thunder emitted from it. This was the sacred training ground of the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion. Only the most outstanding people could obtain the qualification to enter it and train.</p>
 <p>On the highest level of the North Lightning Tower was a spacious hall. At this moment, a number of people were sitting within it. Wave after wave of majestic strength permeated the room, causing the guards standing outside of the hall to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>“Elder Yun’s Spiritual Lightning Tablet has already broken…”</p>
 <p>A silver-colored leader’s seat was located in the middle of the hall. Faint lightning glows moved along the chair, spreading in all directions. A silver-clothed figure was leaning on the backrest of a chair while his silver eyes slowly swept below him. Finally, a faint voice reverberated across the hall.</p>
 <p>His voice was not too loud but had a strong pressuring feeling. No one dared to underestimate him.</p>
 <p>Three old men with different clothes in the hall immediately reacted when these words sounded. They had a clear idea of what a Spiritual Lightning Tablet was. A thread of their spiritual imprint was stored inside. Should they unluckily die one day, this Spiritual Lightning Tablet would also shatter. If this was the case, Chen Yun...”</p>
 <p>“There is actually someone who dares to attack a person from our Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion within the northern region of the Central Plains? Don’t tell me that it is someone from the Ten Thousand Sword Pavilion?” A black-clothed, old man with two long silver-colored eyebrows spoke in a solemn manner.</p>
 <p>“We are temporarily unaware of who it is. This time, Elder Yun had accompanied Hong Chen to Tian Bei City, no? Feng, Lei, Dian. You three elders should investigate just what happened. Capture the person who attacked regardless of who he is, even if he is someone from the Ten Thousand Sword Pavilion. The members of our Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion are not people who can be killed so easily…” The silver-clothed human figure on the leader’s seat slowly commanded.</p>
 <p>“Understood!”</p>
 <p>The three old men immediately stood up and respectfully replied. After which, they transformed into light figures that rushed away before swiftly disappearing.</p>
 <p>The large hall once again became empty and quiet after these three old men disappeared. A moment later, the human figure on the leader’s seat slowly stood up. He gently waved his sleeves and rumbling thunder resounded across the hall.</p>
 <p>“It is really a bold move to touch the people from my Wind Lightning Pavilion in this place. I will likely be laughed at by those two fellows if I don’t locate you…”</p>
