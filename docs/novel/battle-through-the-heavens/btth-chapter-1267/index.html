 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1267: Stacking of Four Seals</u></strong></p>
 <p>Killing desire spread over the enormous square. Vast and mighty Dou Qi pressure descended from the sky, causing quite a number of experts to feel a fear within their hearts.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at old ghost Zhai Xing, Huang Zuan and the others, who had rushed over with a surging murderous desire. A thought passed through his mind. The eleven puppets beside him formed a formation with a lightning like speed. With the transfer of the energy, the dark golden colour of the Sky Demon Puppet swiftly became bright.</p>
 <p>“Leave Huang Xuan to the Sky Demon Puppet. I will deal with old ghost Zhai Xing. All of you will be responsible for blocking the other experts!”</p>
 <p>The big battle was about to erupt with only a spark. Xiao Yan’s expression was also grave as he spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t I hold back old ghost Zhai Xing. That old fellow is too strong…” Little Fairy Doctor hesitated for a moment. Although she possessed quite a great confidence towards Xiao Yan, she was after all clearly aware of old ghost Zhai Xing’s strength. The previous time, Xiao Yan basically did not have any ability to retaliate in the latter’s hands. Even though he end up going all out and staking his life to use the Annihilation Lotus Flame, it had also resulted in Xiao Yan suffering a serious injury that took a year to fully heal…</p>
 <p>“Relax. A nine star Dou Zong and a one star Dou Zun are two completely different concept.” Xiao Yan smiled slightly in the face of Little Fairy Doctor’s concern. Back then, he was indeed no match for old ghost Zhai Xing. Now, however, it would not be an easy matter for the latter to defeat him.</p>
 <p>Little Fairy Doctor did not say anything more when she saw Xiao Yan’s insistence. She was aware of Xiao Yan’s character. The latter would not purposefully act brave. Since he had the confidence, it was likely that nothing should go wrong.</p>
 <p>“In that case… be careful.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the many experts who had arrived amidst the rushing wind sound from all over the place, Little Fairy Doctor nodded her head slightly. Her eyes exchanged glances with Tian Huo zun-zhe and the others. After which, her body flashed and she appeared in the sky a hundred metres away. Majestic Dou Qi surged and completely blocked the experts from the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe and the Wind Lightning Pavilion. She allowed both old ghost Zhai Xing and Huang Xuan to pass her with a flash.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, if you are no match for him, you should cry out. I will do my best to come and aid you.”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen spoke in a deep voice. After which, his sharp gaze was turned towards Bing He zun-zhe, who was slowly walking over through the air. His foot stepped on an empty space. The space became distorted and he appeared in front of Bing He zun-zhe</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded as he looked at Tang Zhen’s back. He flicked his finger and the Sky Demon Puppet beside him, which had absorbed the strength of the other ten puppets, was accompanied by a wind splitting sound as it rushed out with lightning speed. Finally, it blocked that Huang Xuan. Xiao Yan, on the other hand, was using a pair of calm eyes to stare at old ghost Zhai Xing, who was stepping through the empty air and appearing in front of him within a couple of flashes.</p>
 <p>“This time around, I will not give you any more opportunity to struggle.”</p>
 <p>Old ghost Zhai Xing’s face was filled with a savage expression. Originally, he had many opportunities to swiftly finish off Xiao Yan back then at the branch hall of the Hall of Soul. A nine star Dou Zong was an ant like existence in his eyes. However, he did not expect that this ant like existence would end up causing him to pay an extremely cruel price.</p>
 <p>The humiliation of his broken arm would cause the hatred in his heart towards Xiao Yan to become denser each time he recalled it.</p>
 <p>“This is not up to you to decide.” Xiao Yan smiled. Both of his hands suddenly formed numerous strange seals. Afterimages flew before coming to a still an instant later.</p>
 <p>“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. First change! Second change! Third change!”</p>
 <p>After these three sharp cries escaped from his mouth, Xiao Yan’s robes immediately fluttered despite the absence of any wind. His aura also suddenly rose with a rocket like speed at this moment. A moment later, it finally came to a slow halt. At this moment, his aura had suddenly reached that of a three star Dou Zun or so!</p>
 <p>At the Dou Zong class, Xiao Yan was able to increase his strength by five stars when he used the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. However, the gap between each star in the Dou Zun class was far from that within the Dou Zong class. Hence, even though Xiao Yan had already practiced this secret technique until he was extremely familiar with it and utilize the strength of three types of Heavenly Flame, his strength was merely raised by around two stars.</p>
 <p>“The stronger one was, the poorer the effect one can obtain from the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change…” Xiao Yan frowned slightly as he sensed the vast and mighty ocean like Dou Qi within his body. He appeared a little dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>“A Skyfire Three Mysterious Change that is unleashed by three types of Heavenly Flames… this secret technique appears as though it is tailor made for him.”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen a short distance away also sensed the change in Xiao Yan. His face involuntarily shook a little. With his current strength, if he was to use the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, he could only enable his strength to be strengthened a little even with the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame added to it. He could barely even raise his strength by a star. Yet, this secret technique was able to show such an effect in Xiao Yan’s hands. This caused him to be involuntarily speechless. It was likely that few within the history of the Burning Flame Valley had ever achieve such an effect.</p>
 <p>However, should Tang Zhen, who was sighing in a speechless manner in his heart, was to be aware of Xiao Yan’s dissatisfaction at this moment, it was likely that he would have the thought of find some land and barrow himself into it. Within the entire continent, it was likely that only Xiao Yan alone was able to use the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change to raise his strength by two stars at the Dou Zun class…</p>
 <p>“However, it will work…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clenched both of his hands gently. A frightening strength lingered within his palm. It caused Xiao Yan to have the impulse of shattering even space itself.</p>
 <p>“The Burning Flame Valley’s Skyfire Three Mysterious Change…”</p>
 <p>Old ghost Zhai Xing also knitted his brows as he sensed the Dou Qi that had soared within Xiao Yan’s body. He immediately laughed coldly, “A mere three star Dou Zun. This is unworthy for you to act triumphantly in front of the old me.”</p>
 <p>Although old ghost Zhai Xing spoke in this manner, he no longer dared to slight Xiao Yan by even a little. He waved his sleeve, only to hear a clear ‘clang’ sound. Immediately, over a dozen black chains rushed out from old ghost Zhai Xing’s sleeves like poisonous snakes leaving their holes.</p>
 <p>These dark black chains were extremely frightening. In a flash, they had penetrated through the empty air. Their sharp heads were like javelins that violently rushed towards the fatal spots around Xiao yan’s body.</p>
 <p>“Soul Chains, Lock Soul!”</p>
 <p>Old ghost Zhai Xing had a gloomy expression. He flicked his finger. One could see that those dark black chains were surrounding Xiao Yan in a strange fashion. It formed an unusual formation as it did so. An unusual suction force was erupted as the black fog spread. Under this suction force, Xiao Yan suddenly discovered that the soul between his brows had actually trembled at this moment.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows as he sensed this change. His foot stomped on the empty air. Purple brown flame swept out from his body in all directions. Immediately, it ruthlessly adhered onto the black chains. Soon after, numerous sharp screech was emitted from within the chains.</p>
 <p>“These dirty tricks are useless against me!”</p>
 <p>A cold glint flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes. He appeared above old ghost Zhai Xing’s head an instant later. With a clench of his hand, a heavy ruler appeared. It hacked downwards in a furious manner without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Flame Splitting Tsunami!”</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>Old ghost Zhai Xing’s figure did not move as the heavy ruler landed. Over a dozen dark black chains suddenly rushed out from his sleeves. It swiftly encircled above his head. After which, it forcefully received the heavy ruler. The powerful rebound force shook Xiao Yan until he took two steps back.</p>
 <p>“You have improved quite a lot. However, this is still insufficient…” Old ghost Zhai Xing slowly raised his head. His shrivelled face revealed a ferocious smile as he spoke in a dense manner, “This time around, you will no longer be given any chance to struggle!”</p>
 <p>“Dense Net Great Star Hand!”</p>
 <p>After this ferocious laughter of old ghost Zhai Xing sounded, Xiao Yan suddenly discovered this this space had suddenly become greatly distorted. The surrounding environment swiftly changed. He appeared to be in space where the surrounding stars were flickering.</p>
 <p>“Die!”</p>
 <p>Old ghost Zhai Xing’s expression was dark and cold. His hand aimed at Xiao Yan from a distance before clenching violently. One could see the space wiggled rapidly. It transformed into a large star hand that was covered with countless number of light spots. It grabbed violently towards Xiao Yan. Space collapsed wherever the large hand passed, revealing a dark black empty hole…</p>
 <p>“It is actually the Dense Net Great Star Hand. This old fellow… he had actually unleashed it directly after just having clashed…”</p>
 <p>“That Xiao Yan will likely not have an easy time. This is one of the killing blows of old ghost Zhai Xing..,”</p>
 <p>The square did not lack some people who knew their stuff. Hence, they were startled when they saw the starry space that was formed around Xiao Yan’s body and immediately muttered to themselves.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression had become quite grave as he watched the enormous star hand. He could sense this so called Dense Net Great Star Hand was definitely a powerful killing move of old ghost Zhai Xing. It seemed that after having suffered a loss the last time, this old fellow had already understood that finishing the battle quickly was the best method to obtain victory.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>The surrounding air had already been completely locked. Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He had indeed not expect that he would directly enter a life and death battle phase before even the warm up had started. This old fellow had currently learnt to be smart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan suppressed the ripple within his heart. His hands formed seals with lightning like speed. Numerous after images appeared. The Dou Qi within his body also followed the veins in his arms and surged over like floodwater.</p>
 <p>“Open Mountain Seal!”</p>
 <p>“Sea Flipping Seal!”</p>
 <p>“Overturning Land Seal!”</p>
 <p>The three seal complemented each other as Xiao Yan’s expression became much redder. Bright light was vaguely present on his palm. A frightening energy also caused the space to repeatedly crack and form numerous dark black crack lines.</p>
 <p>“It’s not sufficient.”</p>
 <p>The stacking of the three seals had a might that could shatter a mountain. However, Xiao Yan merely shook his head. This alone was insufficient to contend against this killing blow by old ghost Zhai Xing. Immediately, a turbid air was spat out. His hand seal changed once again!</p>
 <p>“Sky Burying Seal!”</p>
 <p>A palm size energy light seal once again appeared abruptly. Immediately, it quietly merged into the three seals earlier in front of Xiao Yan’s purple expression.</p>
 <p>With the stacking of the Sky Burning Seal, the energy light seal had immediately trembled intensely. The light glow bloomed and a layer of strange crystal slowly spread out from the surface of the light seal. After which, it completely covered the light seal…</p>
 <p>God Seal Skill, four seal stacking!</p>
 <p>A heated expression leaped into Xiao Yan’s eyes as he looked at the extremely exquisite crystal hand seal in his hand. The God Seal Skill was one of the high grade skill within the Gu clan. If five seals were stacked on top of each other, it was rumoured to possess a might that was comparable to a Tian class Dou Skill. It was a wonder just what strength these four seals that were stacked onto each other could reach?</p>
