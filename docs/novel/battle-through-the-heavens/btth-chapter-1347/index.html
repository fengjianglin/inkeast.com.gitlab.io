 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1347: Nine Star Energy Body</u></strong></p>
 <p>A rich energy fog continuously seeped from the ground of this desolate quiet large land, covering this endless land…</p>
 <p>Two figures slowly appeared at a certain spot within the vast land. Their eyes swept the somewhat messy ground around them. Their brows twitched slightly after briefly sensing the area.</p>
 <p>“A trace of an eight star energy body... It looks like Hun Ya and Hun Li killed it. Looks like Hun Li has completely recovered. Otherwise, they would not be able to finish it off with such speed.” Xiao Yan grabbed some soil, rubbed it, and spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“These ten plus days have been enough to allow that fellow to recover from his injuries. However, it is not possible to heal his broken arm. His fighting strength will be greatly reduced as a result…” Xun Er’s pretty eyes contained a trace of caution as they swept around her. She softly said, “If we count the days, we should be approaching the entrance to the third level…”</p>
 <p>“Aye, those two fellows have fled for over ten days like dogs who have lost hope. I really wish to see where are will run to.” Xiao Yan stood up and coldly laughed.</p>
 <p>Xun Er nodded.</p>
 <p>“The high energy bodies in this place are more densely packed. Those eight star energy bodies that had been difficult to find occasionally appear now, and I am sensing an obscure energy pressure to the north-east…” Xiao Yan’s eyes shifted to the north-east as he frowned and made a comment.</p>
 <p>“Aye, an energy body that causes even us to feel a little pressure is likely a nine star. Ha ha, Xiao Yan ge-ge, it looks like this is a big fish. Shall we attack?” Xun Er sweetly smiled with her suggestion since she also felt something similar. However, this feeling was much weaker compared to Xiao Yan. This kind of nine star energy body possessed a grade nine energy crystal within its body, alluring the two of them. After all, they had not obtained a single grade nine energy core during this half a year inside the Heavenly Tomb.</p>
 <p>“How can we not attack? A grade nine energy core is not something that one can find on this second level just because we want to…” Xiao Yan smiled. He looked to a spot far in front of him and said, “This time around, let’s just allow those two to escape. There will be a time when we meet them again…”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan turned around and swiftly rushed in the direction of the spot where the energy pressure was coming from. Xun Er swiftly followed behind him.</p>
 <p>The spot where the energy pressure existed was some distance away from the duo. The both of them flew at full speed for nearly twenty minutes before they gradually slowed. It was possible to see some seven star and even eight star energy bodies in this area. However, these energy bodies were all scattered around, appearing as though they were guarding something.</p>
 <p>“A nine star energy body already possesses an intelligence. They have power over the energy bodies and are able to easily control the others. This area can be considered its territory…” Two figures hid behind a large rock. They looked at the energy bodies drifting in the energy fog in the distance as Xun Er softly explained.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded and asked, “Are there any auras of other people around?”</p>
 <p>“No, there is only the two of us…” Xun Er smiled as she replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he heard this. He smiled and said, “Since this is the case, we should quietly enter. The range of these energy bodies’ perception is limited. With the strength of the two of us, it should not be difficult to enter without disturbing them.”</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Xun Er nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled when he saw her nod. His body shook and an after-image appeared. His body quickly disappeared…</p>
 <p>The space beside Xun Er also became slightly distorted when she saw Xiao Yan move. Amid this distortion, her lovely figure slowly became illusory.</p>
 <p>Two gusts of wind quietly entered the energy fog. The slight fluctuation that was stirred along the way might have been sensed by the energy bodies who were moving back and forth. However, their low intelligence only allowed them to remain in their original area, but they did look around before returning to their wandering state.</p>
 <p>A breeze swiftly entered, and after around ten minutes or so, it finally reached the center of this place and transformed into two figures.</p>
 <p>“We have arrived…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked in front of him after he appeared. He saw an area with many rocks all over it. A black-metal-armored figure was seated on the largest rock in front of them. A heavy and calm aura spread from its body. Within the black armor was a pair of empty eye sockets. However, if one were to carefully observe the scene, one would discover that this energy body contained an additional spirituality when compared to the others that Xiao Yan and Xun Er had met earlier.</p>
 <p>“Nine star energy body…”</p>
 <p>A seriousness flashed over Xiao Yan’s eyes as he observed this figure with an ancient calm aura spreading from its body. Although this energy body was much weaker than its actual self, it was still extraordinary. Moreover, this kind of nine star energy body still possessed some of the intelligence and the Dou Skills from when it was alive.</p>
 <p>“Who are you thieves. Show yourselves!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s duo was observing this energy body, something they had never seen before, when a glaring light suddenly erupted from its black armor. The energy body clenched its hand and a large axe half the height of a person appeared. This enormous axe furiously hacked down. An incomparably large wind tore through the air aa it rushed toward Xiao Yan and Xun Er with lightning-like speed.</p>
 <p>“What sharp senses…”</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan and Xun Er’s eyes when they saw this fellow discover the two of them. Their bodies swiftly moved away, dodging that enormous wind.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The wind violently struck the large rock where the two of them had hid earlier after dodging. The rock was instantly blasted into dust. The sharp wind left behind a hundred-foot-long gully.</p>
 <p>“Attack!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure flashed and appeared in the air. A soft cry sounded and a silver glow began to flicker under his feet. Numerous after-images appeared in the sky. His body also appeared in front of the black-armored figure in the blink of an eye. His hand seals changed simultaneously.</p>
 <p>“Open Mountain Seal! Sea Flipping Seal!”</p>
 <p>Both of Xiao Yan’s hands formed a different seal. Each hand contained a seal technique as fierce attacks poured onto the black-armored figure.</p>
 <p>“Clang clang!”</p>
 <p>The energy handprints struck the black-armored figure and the powerful force shook the black-armored figure until it took two steps back.</p>
 <p>“Evil fellows, you dare to offend this venerable self!”</p>
 <p>That black-armored figure furiously roared after being forced back by Xiao Yan in the first exchange. The mountain-splitting axe in his hand suddenly began to rotate like a windmill. A frightening wind smashed toward Xiao Yan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Clang clang clang!”</p>
 <p>A golden flame spear was suddenly launched from behind Xiao Yan when the enormous axe was hacked down. The spear blocked the heavy-mountain-like axe.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed when Xun Er blocked the black-armored figure. He clenched his hand and a heavy ruler appeared in it. Without showing any mercy, he viciously struck it against the black-armored figure’s chest. The powerful force sent the black-armored figure flying like a cannonball. Although this fellow had the strength of a nine star energy body, it was obviously no match for Xiao Yan and Xun Er. Moreover, it merely possessed some intelligence, and it was far from being able to keep up the pace with Xiao Yan, who was rich in battle experience.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>The black-armored energy body furiously roared. A majestic energy surged from its body and shattered the large rocks within a hundred-foot-radius. Immediately, it used mountain-shaking footsteps to charge at Xiao Yan and Xun Er.</p>
 <p>“Let’s end this battle quickly!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly cried out as he watched the black-armored figure charge over. His body charged forward with lightning-like speed and collided head-on with the big fellow.</p>
 <p>“Axe Splitting World!”</p>
 <p>A vast and mighty energy continuously surged out of the black-armored body. The enormous mountain-splitting axe suddenly swelled at this moment. The enormous axe was lifted high in the air, and the surrounding space collapsed at this moment!</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan ge-ge, be careful!”</p>
 <p>Xun Er’s expression changed when she saw such a powerful attack. She hurriedly warned him.</p>
 <p>“Die!”</p>
 <p>The black-armored figure furiously roared. The heavy axe was accompanied by a frightening wind as it violently hacked toward Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The heavy ruler in Xiao Yan’s hand hurriedly met with black-armored figure’s terrifying attack. However, the heavy ruler was sent flying the moment it came into contact and Xiao Yan’s body appeared to have suffered a heavy blow. His face started to pale while his body flew back like a kite with its string broken.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was enduring this ferocious attack by the black-armored figure, Xun Er appeared behind it. She was holding a golden flame spear that she ruthlessly inserted into the back of the figure. A golden flame instantly spread and swallowed the black-armored figure…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who had been sent flying, revealed a smile on his face when he saw her attack. However, the smile on his face had just appeared when the ground beneath him suddenly exploded. Soil shot out and two dark-black ghost-like figures bolted out. They appeared beside Xiao Yan in an instant. A dark chilly wind ruthlessly slammed into Xiao Yan’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, Xiao Yan, when you are chasing other people, you should remember not to get distracted by other things. It is very easy for the roles of the hunter and the hunted to reverse!”</p>
 <p>The ferocious strike smashed into Xiao Yan’s chest. The attacker raised his head and revealed a pale face. The attackers were Hun Ya and Hun Li, the two Xiao Yan and Xun Er had been chasing! At this moment, Hun Ya wore a chilly ferocious expression. Clearly, they had waited a long time for such an opportunity…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s face quickly turned pale when he sensed the duo’s ferocious attack. However, Hun Ya was somewhat stunned to find a strange smile form on Xiao Yan’s face. It caused him to feel a little uneasy.</p>
 <p>“I thought that the both of you were going to hide forever!”</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s dense voice slowly appeared. His figure exploded into nothingness with a ‘bang’ in front of the stunned eyes of Hun Ya’s duo.</p>
 <p>“We have been tricked!”</p>
 <p>Hun Ya and Hun Li felt their hearts sink when they saw Xiao Yan’s body exploding.</p>
