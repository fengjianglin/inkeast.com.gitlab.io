 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1402: Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint</u></strong></p>
 <p>This unexpected change had occurred too suddenly. Even though Yao Lao was close to Xiao Yan, he was unable to react in time. Hence, he only came to a sudden realization after the light had shot between Xiao Yan’s brows. His expression drastically changed.</p>
 <p>Cai Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor reacted after Yao Lao. Their pretty faces turned pale because of their shock. This ancient map was too mysterious. No one knew whether that thing was good or bad.</p>
 <p>Being the main character involved in the sudden change, Xiao Yan was startled when the unusual light shot between his brows, but he immediately recovered. His eyes were shut as he controlled his Spiritual Strength and wildly scanned the spot between his brows. As he scanned it, he quickly discovered that there was a cluster of fist-sized light suspended beneath his brows…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was extremely certain that this light cluster was not something that belonged to him. Moreover, he had never sensed the existence of this thing in the past. Clearly, this thing was the mysterious object that had just shot from the ancient map into his brows.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s spirit stared at the white light cluster, but it simply floated there and did not do anything else. However, it was this kind of quietness that caused Xiao Yan to feel a chill within his heart. The unknown was always frightening, especially when it came to such a terrifying object. Additionally, this thing had appeared in his mind.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ruthlessly cursed in his heart and inhaled a couple of deep breaths as he tried his best to recover his calmness. Only once he had recovered did he maneuver his Spiritual Strength to slowly approach the light cluster.</p>
 <p>The light cluster did not react when Xiao Yan approached. Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength came closer. His Spiritual Strength quietly gathered together as it prepared to launch a fatal attack on this mysterious thing.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan came closer. Just when he was about to use his Spiritual Strength to encircle it, a white light suddenly shot out of the light cluster. It was like a lightning as it shot into Xiao Yan’s soul!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was startled when he sensed this unexpected change, but he did not panic. He swiftly maneuvered all of his Spiritual Strength and formed an extremely powerful shield in front of him. Nevertheless, this weak-looking white glow penetrated through his spiritual defenses without being hindered. It shot into his soul in front of his shocked eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body suddenly stilled when the white light shot into his soul. A painful expression surfaced on his face.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao’s heart immediately sank when he saw the pain on Xiao Yan’s face. His large hand pressed on Xiao Yan’s head with lightning-like speed, and his Spiritual Strength was preparing to forcefully charge into Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>However, Xiao Yan suddenly opened his eyes and began to pant when Yao Lao’s Spiritual Strength was about to enter his body.</p>
 <p>“What happened?” Yao Lao hurriedly halted his actions and asked a question when he saw Xiao Yan open his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know…” Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air and shook his head. After which, he pointed at the spot between his brows and said, “It is here. No matter how I try, I am unable to touch it even a little, but it simply remains there without any signs of moving.”</p>
 <p>“How old were you when we first met?” Yao Lao stared at Xiao Yan before suddenly asking.</p>
 <p>“Ugh? Fifteen.” Xiao Yan was startled. He glanced at Yao Lao with some surprise. Clearly, he did not understand Yao Lao’s intentions.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao sighed in relief only after hearing Xiao Yan’s reply. He bitterly laughed, “I was afraid that someone had possessed your body. Some ancient experts might be physically dead, but their spirits are left behind. Moreover, if a spirit is powerful enough, it will be able to devour another person’s soul and occupy that body.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan widened his mouth. He could only bitterly smile and shake his head.</p>
 <p>“What is that thing?” Yao Lao’s expression was a little grave as he asked.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan rubbed his brow. A moment later, he said, “I am also unsure. Upon contact with it, I was only able to receive some information. There were four words in that information.”</p>
 <p>“What are they?” Yao Lao asked.</p>
 <p>“Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint!” Xiao Yan spoke each word with a pause.</p>
 <p>“Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint?” Yao Lao was slightly startled. He immediately pondered the words as he sat alone on a rock to the side. It appeared as though he had some impression of this name.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, Cai Lin, and the Little Fairy Doctor exchanged glances when they saw Yao Lao sit down. They quietly waited without making a sound.</p>
 <p>This wait continued for around ten minutes or so before Yao Lao finally shook his head. His eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan as he softly said, “If I have guessed correctly, this Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint should be a top expert ten thousand years ago. Moreover, he was once the owner of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!”</p>
 <p>“The owner of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame?” Xiao Yan and the two girls were startled. This Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was actually that powerful. He was able to become the owner of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame? No wonder he would be given such a title.</p>
 <p>“This Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was an extremely well-known person ten thousand years ago. I have read a little about him in some ancient books. It is rumored that this person was known as the expert closest to a Dou Di in that era…” Yao Lao slowly explained.</p>
 <p>“An expert closest to a Dou Di…” Xiao Yan clenched his hand without realizing it. It was unexpected that this Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint reached such a level… his title was really extraordinary.</p>
 <p>“Could that thing under my brows be left by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint? Xiao Yan asked.</p>
 <p>“It is likely the case… this ancient map is likely something that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint left behind.” Yao Lao nodded. He looked at Xiao Yan’s somewhat uncertain expression and bitterly laughed, “I also really don’t understand what has happened. However, based on the record that I have read in the ancient books, this Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint might be a little heretical, but he can be considered quite upright. It is likely that he will not use some overly shameless methods. That thing under your brow will likely not pose much of a threat to you.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily rolled his eyes. This reasoning was a little too forced, but he did not have another answer at this moment. All he could do was hope for the best and pray that this thing would not bring him any trouble.</p>
 <p>“I think that this thing hidden within the ancient map will be related to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Ha ha, this might be the benefit of collecting the ancient map…” Yao Lao laughed. At this moment, all he could do was comfort Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. Since the situation had developed like this, it was pointless for him to be dispirited. All he could do now was to believe that the situation was just as Yao Lao had described. This thing was a benefit from completing the ancient map. However, the only thing that caused Xiao Yan to relax was that he did not sense any danger from the cluster of light.</p>
 <p>His spirit had reached such strength that he would ultimately feel something if he faced any danger. However, Xiao Yan did not sense anything from the mysterious light cluster that caused him to feel a danger.</p>
 <p>“Let’s just quietly wait and observe this thing.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao patted Xiao Yan’s shoulder. His expression was a little serious as he said, “Now, you should be thinking of how you can raise your strength to the Dou Sheng class within these three years!”</p>
 <p>“I need not say anything more regarding the strength of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Honestly speaking, if the current me met the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, there would only be one fate that awaited me. I would turn into its fire slave…”</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth slightly twitched. He naturally understood what a fire slave was. It was the slave of a flame. The slave’s mind was controlled by a Heavenly Flame, but only some extremely powerful Heavenly Flames possessed such an ability. Even the Three Thousand Burning Flame did not possess such an ability. Based on Xiao Yan’s guess, it was likely that only those Heavenly Flames ranked in the top three could make a fire slave.</p>
 <p>“In the past, I was worried about how you would handle the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame if you were to find it. Fortunately, there is a little more time than I expected…” Yao Lao smiled. He continued, “You are currently at the peak of an eight star Dou Zun. There is still an incredible distance to a true Dou Sheng. Even if your training speed is fast, it will be extremely difficult to reach the Dou Sheng class within three years.</p>
 <p>“If you do not reach the Dou Sheng class, I will not allow you to go even if the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame really appears because you are only going to attempt suicide.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled. He had not expected Yao Lao to be this afraid of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p>
 <p>“In that case, the only solution is to get Xiao Yan to reach the Dou Sheng class within three years, right?” Cai Lin opened her mouth and asked.</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Yao Lao slightly nodded. His eyes landed on Xiao Yan as he said, “The chances of success are extremely low. Fortunately, you seem to be quite lucky…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled. He suddenly recovered. “Teacher is saying… the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree?”</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Yao Lao nodded. He smiled and said, “Unless you are able to obtain the Bodhisattva Heart, it is basically impossible for you to reach the Dou Sheng class within three years…”</p>
 <p>“Bodhisattva Heart…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smacked his mouth. He bitterly laughed, “This will not be easy either. The location of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree is within the Ancient Wasteland Region. It is a forbidden ground for humans. Moreover, the Ancient Region is huge. How can it be so easy to find the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree?”</p>
 <p>“If it was easy, would you even have the chance to go?” Yao Lao smiled and chided him. He said, “You possess a Bodhisattva Seed in your hand. Although its purity is quite low, it should enable you to sense the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. This is your advantage, and this is your only path if you really wish to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Hence, you must obtain this Bodhisattva Heart!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed. He could only nod his head. It seemed that he needed to head to the Ancient Wasteland Region this time around. If he relied on his normal training speed, he would not be able to reach the Dou Sheng class within three years.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. We will return to the Falling Star Pavilion and properly plan. If the news is real, the Central Plains will become bedlam because of the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. At that time, the Ancient Wasteland Region will really become lively…” Yao Lao stood up and faintly said, “Whether you will be able to reach the Dou Sheng class within three years, will rely on the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree.”</p>
