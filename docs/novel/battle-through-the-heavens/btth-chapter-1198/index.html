 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1198: Seal Breaking</u></strong></p>
 <p>Qiu Ling’s expression became gloomy when the strange laugh resounded over the region. He did not even pause for a moment as he waved his sleeves. A vast and mighty Dou Qi pillar emitted a ‘chi’ sound as it tore through space and rushed toward the spot where Old Mu Gu was at.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk…”</p>
 <p>The vast and mighty Dou Qi pillar did not strike Old Mi Gu. He flashed and withdrew in an extremely agile manner. After which, his hands suddenly formed numerous hand seals while he withdrew. Following the formation of these hand seals, Xiao Yan’s group suddenly discovered the dragon seal on the Three Thousand Burning Flame’s forehead suddenly echo and emit a slight energy fluctuation.</p>
 <p>“This is bad…”</p>
 <p>The hearts of Xiao Yan’s group felt shock upon sensing this situation.</p>
 <p>“Old Mu Gu, how dare you!” Qiu Ling’s expression also changed at this moment as he furiously cried out.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, there is nothing in this world that the old me does not dare do.” Old Mu Gu let out a cold laugh in the face of Qiu Ling’s cry. His rapidly changing hand seals suddenly stiffened while that strange smile on his face spread. “Relax, the old me is only trying to help your Pill Tower resolve this trouble.”</p>
 <p>“Explode!”</p>
 <p>A cold cry was suddenly emitted from Old Mu Gu’s mouth after he yelled out.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The clear sound of an explosion suddenly materialized without any forewarning after Old Mu Gu’s cry sounded.</p>
 <p>The eyes of Xiao Yan’s group immediately turned to the Three Thousand Burning Flame when this explosion sounded. After which, they saw a dragon scale on the forehead of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, not protected by any flames, explode at this moment.</p>
 <p>With the dragon scale bursting apart, Xiao Yan’s group were shocked to discover that the large-sized dragon was slowly opening its tightly shut, huge dragon eyes. Clearly, some opening had appeared in the perfect seal at this moment.</p>
 <p>“The Three Thousand Burning Flame has awoken!”</p>
 <p>An exclamation sounded when everyone saw the large dragon gradually opening its dragon eyes. Immediately, it stirred a commotion.</p>
 <p>The large dragon slowly opened its eyes. A moment later, an ice-cold air surged out. This Three Thousand Burning Flame’s eyes swept over Xiao Yan’s group before it suddenly let out an earth-shaking dragon roar into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The moment that dragon roar sounded, the purple-black flame on the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame suddenly soared. It appeared just like the flame of blazing skies as it covered this empty space.</p>
 <p>The purple-black flame surged and an unusual luster erupted from the densely packed black symbols on the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. They appeared just like a web that had firmly entwined itself around the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>The Three Thousand Burning Flame struggled with all its might. Its roar resonated throughout the Star Region. Purple-black flames wildly seared the symbols made of black lines. Moreover, there was a continuous cool star strength seeping into this empty space before pouring into the enormous body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame in an endless manner.</p>
 <p>Faced with this all out retaliation from the Three Thousand Burning Flame after being quiet for such a long time, even the black symbols appeared to be humbled at this moment. Some symbols had become much dimmer as the purple-black flame wildly burned.</p>
 <p>“Mu Gu, you are seeking death!”</p>
 <p>The sudden awakening of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had also exceeded Qiu Ling’s expectations. By the time he had recovered, his face had already been covered by a furious green expression. An angry roar carried an endless amount of fury and killing intent as it rushed toward Old Mu Gu.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, since your Pill Tower is unable to deal with this Heavenly Flame, what is the point of keeping it? Why don’t you allow my Hall of Souls to help you enjoy it? Would that not be better?”</p>
 <p>Old Mu Gu’s expression slightly changed when Qiu Ling rushed over with killing intent covering his entire body. Soon after, Old Mu Gu began to coldly laugh.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, all of you should break the jade beads and inform the association head!” However, Qiu Ling still retained some reasoning despite his fury. He did not forget to cry out loud while he charged toward Old Mu Gu.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, Cao Ying, and the rest hurriedly nodded upon hearing Qiu Ling’s cry. They took out the information-transmitting jade beads from their Storage Rings. They were just about to shatter them when a sharp wind suddenly appeared. After which, the wind transformed into fine needles that trickily struck the jade beads.</p>
 <p>Due to this attack being too sudden, the jade beads in the hands of Cao Ying and the others shot out of their hands and flew into the distance.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan let out a cold snort. Two of his fingers clamped down with lightning-like speed. After which, they steadily received those fine needles. The other hand of his shattered the jade bead. After which, he turned in the direction the wind had come from. The ones who had attacked were two competitors that had gotten into the top ten spots.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that there are still members of the Hall of Souls…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily let out a cold laugh upon seeing these two people. He had underestimated the strength of the Hall of Souls. There were others who had entered the top ten other than Old Mu Gu. The number of people who had qualified was comparable to that of the Pill Tower.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, so what if you have sent a message? The Three Thousand Burning Flame is struggling with all its might. The three great heads will definitely be unable to split their attention in order to maintain the seal of the star region. Moreover, Holy Pill City is extremely chaotic. The experts from the Pill Tower will not be able to free themselves!” A middle-aged man with a shady face laughed.</p>
 <p>“Looks like the Hall of Souls has meticulously planned its actions today…” Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. After hearing these words, it seemed that some experts from the Hall of Souls had stirred some trouble within Holy Pill City. This would delay quite a number of experts from the Pill Tower. The Three Thousand Burning Flame was the best thing to hold back the three great heads.</p>
 <p>In order to maintain this Star Region prison, they would definitely not be able to act as they pleased. Otherwise, if the Star Region were broken and this Three Thousand Burning Flame were to be let free, Holy Pill City would be destroyed by it.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, what should we do?” Cao Ying and Dan Chen softly asked while standing behind Xiao Yan. At this moment, Qiu Ling and Old Mu Gu were engaged in an intense battle. Their main pillar of support seemed to have become Xiao Yan. The expression of Song Qing became a little green when he saw this. However, after some hesitation, he could only unwillingly stand behind Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“What else can we do? We are unable to intervene in those two places. Currently we can only watch and wait for reinforcements from the Pill Tower…” Xiao Yan’s expression was a little solemn as he replied.</p>
 <p>Cao Ying and Dan Chen widened their mouths when they heard this. They looked at each other and could only nod. The two battlegrounds in this region really did not have any room for them to intervene.</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was speaking, space itself had suddenly rippled. Wave after wave of a vast, mighty strength surged out. After which, it gathered on the Three Thousand Burning Flame. Following the pouring in of this vast and mighty strength, the black line symbols began to emit a glow again. Clearly, the three great heads had intervened.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>Faced with the increase of the strength of the seal, the Three Thousand Burning Flame fire dragon’s eyes revealed a crimson color. Today, was the best chance it had to escape captivity. Although it was unable to do anything against the three great heads of the Pill Tower, they were also unable to kill it. If it did not take the opportunity to flee today, it did not know just when it would have to wait for the next opportunity to appear. The seal of the three great heads during these years had caused it to suffer.</p>
 <p>A destructive aura suddenly spread out of its body while a bright redness rose within the dragon eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame…</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s eyes involuntarily twitched as he sensed this destructive aura. His Extermination Lotus Flame also possessed this kind of feeling. It seemed that this Three Thousand Burning Flame was playing with its life…</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>A low, furious roar continued to reverberate over this empty space. The purple-black fire on the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame suddenly wiggled. After which, it swiftly agglomerated in front of everyone’s stunned gazes. Within the short blink of an eye, a strange, black flame, that caused one’s heart to tremble, suddenly appeared. Finally, the flame split apart, transforming into tiny black fires that landed on the enormous body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame from all directions.</p>
 <p>Chi chi chi!</p>
 <p>The deep-black flame dripped onto the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. The black seals began to swiftly collapse. However, this tactic seemed to exhaust a great amount of energy because the glint within the eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame fire dragon seemed to have become dimmer.</p>
 <p>“You still only have these methods after all these years. Do you think that you can seal me for eternity with them?”</p>
 <p>Although it greatly exhausted the strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, there was an excitement forming within its eyes. It had thought of all sorts of ways to break this seal that had pestered it for many years.</p>
 <p>The body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame continued to struggle. The black symbols swiftly scattered. Although the majestic energy that spread out was continuously being replenished, it seemed to be far from being able to catch up with the rate of damage.</p>
 <p>“This is bad. The Three Thousand Burning Flame is about to break the seal…”</p>
 <p>Seeing the thinning black lines of the seal on the Three Thousand Burning Flame, the expressions of Cao Ying, Dan Chen, and Song Qing became a little paler. Being members of the Pill Tower, they were clearly aware of just what kind of damage would be created once the Three Thousand Burning Flame escaped.</p>
 <p>Compared to the pale expressions of these three, Xiao Yan did not reveal the slightest anxiety on his face. If the Three Thousand Burning Flame were to really escape from it seal, the chances of him subduing it would increase. Doing this might pose some risk, but as the saying went, one could seek fortune from danger. Currently, he could not be bothered…</p>
 <p>“Ha ha! Xuan Kong Zi, this time around, it is your turn to fail!”</p>
 <p>That Three Thousand Burning Flame suddenly raised its enormous dragon head just when Xiao Yan’s eyes were flickering. A thunder-like laugh resounded over this empty space.</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>The laugh had just sounded when the enormous body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame violently rotated in the empty space. Immediately, a breaking sound suddenly appeared.</p>
 <p>Cao Ying’s group involuntarily trembled upon hearing this breaking sound.</p>
 <p>“The seal… has failed.”</p>
