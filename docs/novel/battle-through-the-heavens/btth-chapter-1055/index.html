 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1055: Seeing Pill Lightning Again</u></strong></p>
 <p>Thick, dark clouds gathered in the sky above the valley. The ray of morning light, that had just appeared on the horizon, was blocked by the clouds. Within an instant, the entire valley had become exceptionally dark. Only when the silver-colored lightning cut through the dark clouds would the valley below light up.</p>
 <p>The medicinal fragrance on the stage had reached a peak saturation when dark clouds gathered in the sky. Even the surrounding natural energy of the stone stage was drawn by this pill fragrance, emitting a slight vibration as it did so.</p>
 <p>A jade-green flame fiercely burned within the medicinal cauldron. A green-red spherical medicinal pill was slowly rotating in the air above the flame. A shocking energy was repeatedly being emitted from it. The energy collided with the walls of the medicinal cauldron, emitting a ‘clanging’ metallic sound.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the medicinal pill that was rotating within the medicinal cauldron. A smile involuntarily surfaced on his pale-white face. His eyelids were slowly shut and a fatigue spread from his soul, causing him to feel a little giddy. The pill formation this time around had really exhausted him a little too much. If his will has not supports him from within his heart, it was likely that he would have found it difficult to succeed.</p>
 <p>The thunderbolt that cut through the dark clouds within the sky lit up Xiao Yan’s pale face. He appeared exceptionally frail. Everyone knew that he had used up all of his strength once they saw his condition.</p>
 <p>“Young friend Yan Xiao, a mere thanks does not do a great favor justice. Leave the pill lightning to the old me. You can rest for awhile.” Tang Zhen woke up from his excited state. He hurriedly spoke with his hands cupped together when he saw the frail condition of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen was just about to fight with this so-called Pill Lightning after speaking these words when he suddenly heard Xiao Yan panting, “Valley Chief Tang, leave the matter of the Pill Lightning to me.”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen was startled when he heard this. He hurriedly said, “Young friend Yan Xiao. Rest assured that this Pill Lightning won’t be able to harm the old me. How can you still receive this Pill Lightning in your current condition?”</p>
 <p>“Of course I am aware that you can receive the Pill lightning. However, my Earth Demon Puppet still requires the Pill Lightning to refine its body…” Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and muttered in his heart. He immediately waved his hand and the bright-silver Earth Demon Puppet appeared with a flash. He glanced at Tang Zhen and softly laughed, “Valley Chief Tang, this Pill Lightning is useful to me. Please do not snatch it away from me…”</p>
 <p>After the refinement by the Pill Lightning last time, the strength of the Earth Demon Puppet had undoubtedly risen. If it were to undergo another refinement, it was likely that the might of the Earth Demon Puppet would increase again. This thing was a top notch fighter for Xiao Yan. It would naturally be best if its strength could increase.</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen was startled when he saw the Earth Demon Puppet that appeared. A surprise immediately flashed through his eyes as he exclaimed, “Puppet?”</p>
 <p>With Tang Zhen’s eyesight, he was naturally able to identify the Earth Demon Puppet at a glance. Xiao Yan did not feel any surprise about this. He raised his head, looked at the dense, dark clouds in the sky, and nodded.</p>
 <p>“Since young friend Yan Xiao insists on doing so, I will allow your puppet to face the Pill Lightning. You can just voice any concerns if anything happens later.” Although he was unaware of why Xiao Yan had such confidence in his puppet, this Pill Lightning was ultimately something that Xiao Yan had summoned and Tang Zhen was unable to comment too much. Moreover, Xiao Yan had already done him a massive favor by helping him successfully refine the Fire Bodhisattva Pill. Tang Zhen would naturally not say too much about such a small matter.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His eyes looked to the sky. He weakly raised his hand and softly said, “Go.”</p>
 <p>The order had just sounded when the Earth Demon Puppet’s feet violently stomped on the ground. Its body rose like a rocket and paused in mid-air. The thick, dark clouds were emitting lightning’s might around a couple hundred feet above its head.</p>
 <p>The surprise in Tang Zhen’s eyes involuntarily increased in intensity when he saw that the Earth Demon Puppet was able to remain suspended in the air like an elite Dou Zong. His heart let out a praise. He discovered that he appeared to be unable to see through this extremely young man. Not only did this person possess a Heavenly Flame, but he also possessed such a great achievement in terms of pill refinement. Now, he had even took out a puppet that was comparable to an elite Dou Zong. All of this caused Xiao Yan’s identity to become much more mysterious…</p>
 <p>All of the changes on the stone stage were captured by the eyes of those present, especially the case when they saw Xiao Yan summon a silver-colored human figure that flew into the sky. All of them were stunned. Due to a puppet not possessing any breath, some of those with sharper senses could tell what it was after probing it.</p>
 <p>“It is actually a puppet? Does Yan Xiao intend to use this puppet to block the Pill Lightning?”</p>
 <p>“The Pill Lightning formed by a high-grade tier 7 medicinal pill is not child’s play. Even five star and above expert Dou Zongs will barely be able to block it. Can that puppet receive it?”</p>
 <p>Everyone present felt really uncertain about Xiao Yan’s . Due to his earlier shocking performance, however, everyone learns to be a little better behaved. They did not dare to randomly ridicule him because everyone knew that this young man, who appeared much younger than all of them, possessed an achievement far from what they could compare with.</p>
 <p>Although this was quite harsh to these alchemist grandmasters, it was, after all, the truth. They would not be able to escape it regardless of how difficult it was for them to accept it. Since they could not escape, they could only forcefully accept it…</p>
 <p>Of course, they were not the only ones who possessed such thoughts. The Burning Flame Valley disciples around the square were unable to make heads or tails of Xiao Yan’s actions. If Xiao Yan was at his peak, they might still believe him if he wanted to receive the Pill Lightning. However, he was completely spent. Forget about receiving the Pill Lightning. Even a random Burning Flame Valley disciple would be able to defeat him at this moment…</p>
 <p>“What is father thinking? Although that puppet will receive the Pill Lightning, it is clear that it is connected to Yan Xiao. If the puppet is destroyed by the Pill Lightning, Yan Xiao will suffer an injury as a result. With his current condition, it is very difficult for him to receive such a blow…” Tang Huo Er’s eyebrows were vertical as she studied the silver-colored figure in the sky. She involuntarily and softly muttered to herself.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about the numerous doubtful eyes around the square. He also did not do anything about them because the dark clouds in the sky had unleashed their might after a brewing period. A loud thunderous roar continuously rumbled.</p>
 <p>“I wonder if the Earth Demon Puppet will advance in grade after absorbing this Pill Lightning…” Xiao Yan muttered to himself. The Earth Demon Puppet was divided into three grades: the Man, Earth, and Sky grade. When the puppet was initially refined, it was mixed between the lowest Man grade and Earth grade. However, after being refined by the Pill Lightning once, it had leaped into the Earth grade.</p>
 <p>Just a mere Earth grade Earth Demon Puppet was able to fight a five to six star Dou Zong. If it was the highest grade Sky Demon Puppet… it was likely that it would possess the ability to fight even in the face of an elite Dou Zun.</p>
 <p>“A Dou Zun class puppet…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart involuntarily turned fiery hot when he thought about this. It gradually calmed down. It was definitely not so easy to reach the sky grade. This kind of thing must be taken slow.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Thunder suddenly exploded across the sky when this thought appeared in Xiao Yan’s head. Immediately, one could see a thigh-thick silver bolt of lightning tearing through the dark clouds like a silver, giant python. After which, it rushed toward the medicinal cauldron on the stone stage in a lightning-like fashion.</p>
 <p>A thought rushed through Xiao Yan’s heart when the silver lightning shot out. The Earth Demon Puppet in the sky immediately rushed down. It appeared on the stone stage, widened its arms, and allowed the silver-colored bolt to violently smash into its body.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>Silver lightning struck the body of the puppet while an unusually deep, muffled sound appeared. This sound caused everyone’s hearts to suddenly jump.</p>
 <p>The body of the Earth Demon Puppet was pushed down by this silver lightning bolt by nearly ten meters. Only then did it forcefully stabilize its body. At this moment, a countless number of silver-colored lightning arcs were flashing as they repeatedly entered its body. If it was an ordinary person, it was likely that their skin would have split open long ago. However, the Earth Demon Puppet did not feel anything. Instead, its shriveled body was gradually becoming stronger as the lightning entered it…</p>
 <p>“It is actually absorbing the energy of the Pill Lightning?”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhen looked at the puppet which was fine despite having been struck by the silver lightning. It was instead absorbing the strength of the bolt. A surprised expression involuntarily flashed across Tang Zhen’s eyes when he did so.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>After a silver bolt of lightning was easily received by the Earth Demon Puppet, the dark clouds in the sky began to intensely churn. An instant later, another three lightningbolts, even stronger than the first one, rushed down from the dark clouds. The rumbling sound of explosions followed!</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>Faced with these three silver bolts, the Earth Demon Puppet did not hesitate even a little under Xiao Yan’s control. It appeared just like a lightning rod, attracting the three silver bolts of lightning to its body.</p>
 <p>The Earth Demon Puppet fell under the fierce strike of the three silver lightning. It smashed into the ground. Both of its feet were inserted deep into the hard-rock ground. However, it rose after the silver lightning scattered. Its entire body was emitting a dazzling silver glow as it floated into the air, appearing just like a majestic war god that would never fall.</p>
 <p>The Pill Lightning appeared to have become angered in the face of this provocation by the Earth Demon Puppet. It repeatedly spat out enormous bolts of lightning from the dark clouds. After which, it appeared like a machine gun as they were beckoned to the Earth Demon Puppet body with a crackling sound. This spectacular scene caused those viewing it to feel their breathing turn sluggish…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes looked at at the Earth Demon Puppet that was smashed down again and again by the Pill Lightning in the sky before it would rise again. A smile filled with anticipation involuntarily surfaced on his face. He wondered just how much stronger the Earth Demon Puppet would become after being refined by the Pill Lightning this time around.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart was filled with anticipation when he thought of this…</p>
