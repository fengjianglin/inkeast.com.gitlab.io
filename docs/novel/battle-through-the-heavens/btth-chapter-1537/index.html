 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1537: Little Yi Revealing Its Might</u></strong></p>
 <p>A great storm had formed within Xiao Yan’s heart at this moment. The Nihility Devouring Flame was a Heavenly Flame that was ranked second on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. It was ranked even higher than the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. The mystery surrounding this Heavenly Flame was even thicker than the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. At the very least, news of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had slivered across the continent, but it Xiao Yan had never heard of any news relating to this Nihility Devouring Flame until now!</p>
 <p>The Nihility Devouring Flame was ranked second on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. This flame was born from nothing. There was no image to look for nor a form to grasp. From a certain point of view, the Nihility Devouring Flame could be considered a mysterious existence. The Nihility Devouring Flame was said to be able to devour anything. Only a small number of things in the world could resist its devouring ability, but this Nihility Devouring Flame only existed in legends. No one had ever heard about any signs of this thing. Hence, the shock within Xiao Yan’s heart was relatively intense when he saw the chief of the Hall of Souls actually summon this Heavenly Flame, which only existed in legends.</p>
 <p>“Nihility Devouring Flame… this… how can this be possible? How can he possess the Nihility Devouring Flame?”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao had also immediately recognized the unusual black flame. An extreme shock was visible on his face as he involuntarily cried out.</p>
 <p>Everyone by the side trembled violently upon hearing these words. Even the ancestor of the Pill Tower revealed an extremely grave expression.</p>
 <p>Some of the experts around felt some uncertainty after seeing the Fallen Mountain Range, which had become completely silent. The Nihility Devouring Flame was far too mysterious. Only an extremely few individuals were able to recognize it. Hence, many people felt somewhat at a loss when they saw the black flame in the chief of the Hall of Souls’ hand.</p>
 <p>“Squeak squeak!”</p>
 <p>The cluster of black flames with a human face in the hands of the chief of the Hall of Souls seemed to have become a little stronger after swallowing the pink flame. Waves of excited cries were actually being emitted from it.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, it seems that it is extremely satisfied with your taste. This chief has seldom seen it reveal such excitement…” The chief of the Hall of Souls faintly laughed upon seeing its reaction.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes did not blink as he stared at the cluster of black flames. He suddenly knit his brows a moment later. Finally, he slowly shook his head and softly said, “This Heavenly Flame of yours is not the Nihility Devouring Flame!”</p>
 <p>Many people were involuntarily startled after Xiao Yan’s words sounded. Even Yao Lao was a little stunned. Other than the Nihility Devouring Flame, no other Heavenly Flame possessed a devouring power.</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls merely lifted his brow upon hearing Xiao Yan’s remarks. His hand slowly rubbed the human-faced black flames in his hand and asked, “If this flame of mine is not the Nihility Devouring Flame, why don’t you tell me what it is?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stared at the chief of the Hall of Souls’ face and smiled. The shock within his heart also slowly drained. This Nihility Devouring Flame was indeed able to emit a unique Devouring Power, but Xiao Yan was in possession of six types of Heavenly Flames. Hardly anyone on the continent possessed a better understanding of the Heavenly Flames than him. Hence, he vaguely sensed something was not quite right after he cooled down. This feeling that something was wrong could not be pinpointed, but he became certain in his heart after hearing the chief’s reply.</p>
 <p>The human-faced black flames in the hands of the chief of the Hall of Soul might have a relationship with the Nihility Devouring Flame, but Xiao Yan was certain that this thing was not the true Nihility Devouring Flame. This was a judgement that Xiao Yan could make because of his vast experience of playing with flames for over a decade!</p>
 <p>“The devouring power that this flame possesses cannot be faked. It is indeed something that the Nihility Devouring Flame possesses. However… it seems to be a little weak. Could it be that this thing is a seed flame of the Nihility Devouring Flame?” Xiao Yan’s eyes stared at the chief of the Hall of Souls as he suddenly inquired.</p>
 <p>This so-called seed flame was a flame that was separate from the essence flame. A seed flame possessed some of the abilities of the essence flame, but it was a lot weaker. From a certain point of view, it could be considered an avatar of the Heavenly Flame. However, the ability to separate and form a seed flame was something that very few Heavenly Flames possessed. The old Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame might possess such an ability, but it had not separated itself because once one separated and formed a seed flame, one would be decreasing one’s strength. That demonic flame did not like the feeling of his strength being separated.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were staring intently at the hall chief’s face. He was clearly able to detect the chief’s eyes narrowing when the words ‘seed flame’ were mentioned.</p>
 <p>“As expected…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan coldly laughed in his heart upon seeing this slight change. If this person really possessed the true Nihility Devouring Flame, he would have already absorbed all the energy in the air by now. Why would he slowly devour it like he was doing at this moment?</p>
 <p>“However, this chief possesses the seed flame of the Nihility Devouring Flame… this means that the Hun clan likely owns the true Nihility Devouring Flame…” Xiao Yan’s heart was a little solemn. He had not expected to discover a hint of the foundation of the Hun clan this time around. The Nihility Devouring Flame was something that merely existed in legends. Yet… it was actually in the hands of the Hun clan. This was not good news to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“You are indeed worthy of being an expert at playing with fire…”</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls gently held the human-faced black flames in his hand as he laughed in a faint voice. He had quietly affirmed Xiao Yan’s guess. The Nihility Devouring Flame was extremely important to the Hun clan. Although he possessed a high status, it was impossible for him to bring out its true form. Forget about whether he had the ability to control the Nihility Devouring Flame. Even if he could, the clan would not allow anyone other than the clan head to bring it out of the Hun realm…</p>
 <p>“However, even if it is merely a seed flame, it is more than enough to finish you off…” The chief of the Hall of Souls lifted his hand. The human face formed by the cluster of black flames widened its mouth and violently bit the chief’s hand. Dou Qi began to surge out of his body before being swallowed by those black flames.</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls became a little pale after the Dou Qi within his body was swallowed by the black flames, but the black flames were growing more powerful. In the end, it emitted a sharp howl from its mouth. Its originally head-sized body had become a thousand feet tall, causing black flames to rage in the sky. Those present could sense the Dou Qi within their bodies vaguely show signs of attempting to break free from their bodies. They hurriedly suppressed their Dou Qi in order to avoid embarrassing themselves.</p>
 <p>“Squeak…”</p>
 <p>The enormous human-faced black flames drifted through the sky. Its black hollow eyes stared at Xiao Yan. The faint sound of saliva being swallowed could be, making the face of the black flames appear stranger.</p>
 <p>“Devouring Flame sir, kill him!”</p>
 <p>The chief of the Hall of Souls was filled with respect as he commanded this flame. The way he addressed this cluster of flames was also different.</p>
 <p>“Squeak squeak!”</p>
 <p>The human-faced black flames let out a strange cry upon hearing this command. After which, the flames whistled and moved. They penetrated through space like a ghost and sealed the space around Xiao Yan. Threads of black fire lines spread. They appeared like a cage as they trapped Xiao Yan within.</p>
 <p>This sudden scene startled everyone. No one had expected this unusual cluster of black flames to be able to unleash its own attack.</p>
 <p>“What a delicious taste…”</p>
 <p>The black flames wiggled and the enormous human face once again appeared in front of Xiao Yan. It let out a sharp and strange laugh, “Obediently allow me to devour you!”</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A frightening devouring power erupted from the surrounding space after the black flame’s sharp laughter sounded. This strength caused Xiao Yan’s expression to slightly alter. He was preparing to suppress the violent Heavenly Flame within his body when powerful pink flames suddenly surged out of his body in all directions without any warning.</p>
 <p>This sudden unexpected change startled Xiao Yan. He saw the pink flames quickly gather in front of him. They transformed into a palm-sized fire baby. This baby was Little Yi.</p>
 <p>“Little Yi, quick, come back!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart pounded upon seeing this baby appear. Little Yi was the essence of six merged Heavenly Flames. Xiao Yan would really end up jumping in panic if Little Yi was swallowed by the black flames.</p>
 <p>“Yi Wa Yi Wa`”</p>
 <p>Little Yi merely shook his small head when he heard Xiao Yan’s panic cry. That tender little face strangely contained some fury as it glared at the human face. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame and the Nihility Devouring Flame were respectively ranked third and second, but neither was more powerful or frightening than the other. Of course, this was because no one had truly seen a fight between these two types of Heavenly Flames. Hence, it was impossible to predict the results…</p>
 <p>Although Yi Wa was a newly formed Heavenly Flame from the merger of six Heavenly Flames, his instincts had mostly been taken from the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Hence, hearing these black flames, which were merely a seed from the main flame, act arrogantly, provoke him causing a fury to rise from deep within his bones.</p>
 <p>“Yi Wa!”</p>
 <p>In his fury, Little Yi’s small body suddenly burst apart. A pink sea of flames suddenly spread across the sky. The black flame prison that the black flames had formed was forcefully shattered, and then the pink flame swept in the opposite direction and turned into an even larger fire prison. This prison had been formed to trap the cluster of black flames.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Flame within Xiao Yan’s body revealed its full strength under the control of Little Yi. Even when Xiao Yan personally used the flames, he would not be able to match Little Yi’s control. After all, Little Yi could control the Heavenly Flame to a perfect and flawless extent because… his actual form was the spirit of a flame.</p>
 <p>This unexpected change had startled the nihility black flame. It hurriedly unleashed its devouring power. This time around, it was no longer so lucky. Under the personal control of Little Yi, every wisp of flame controlled its own thoughts. The results would be unpredictable if the nihility Devouring Flame’s actual form were to swallow Little Yi, but how could a mere flame seed act skilled in front of a true grandmaster?</p>
 <p>“Yi Wa!”</p>
 <p>Little Yi completely ignored the devouring of the nihility black flame. The pink flame churned before transforming into a large baby that was similar in size to the huge face. After which, it firmly grabbed the large face in front of tons of pairs of stunned eyes. Little Yi appeared like he was actually planning to swallow this Nihility Devouring Flame’s flame seed...</p>
