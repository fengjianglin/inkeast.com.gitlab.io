 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1090: Poison Dan Method, Begin!</u></strong></p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor nodded when she heard him. She inhaled a deep breath of air and suppressed the anxiety in her heart. After which, she sat cross-legged on the altar. She straightened her upper body. Her long neck and narrow waist formed an alluring curve.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also sat down. He raised his head and looked at the countless lights that shot down from the sky. His hand gently caressed the empty air. Immediately, a warm feeling was emitted from his palm. He sensed a kind of pure light and heat in the sunlight.</p>
 <p>“Not bad…” Xiao Yan slightly praised. This was indeed a good place. Even if he did not do anything, this place would cause the Little Fairy Doctor’s Woeful Poison Body to be naturally suppressed. Thus, they would be able to avoid the situation of having the Woeful Poison Body erupt midway through, causing some unnecessary trouble.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes slightly shifted. After which, they paused on the dark-black stone tablet set in the altar. Ye Zhong had already mentioned that this stone tablet was the key to activating this altar.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hands gently pushed the dark-black stone tablet. A hot feeling surged from within. However, it did not cause Xiao Yan the slightest discomfort. He used a little strength and pushed the stone tablet aside amid a cracking sound.</p>
 <p>The stone tablet was slowly pushed aside and a head-sized dark-black hole appeared in Xiao Yan’s sight. It was likely that this was the hole that Ye Zhong had mentioned.</p>
 <p>“Creak creak!”</p>
 <p>When the stone tablet was pushed aside, it seemed to have activated something. The stone walls around the altar slowly moved. Immediately, they formed a round stone wall, surrounding Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor in an extremely tight manner. If one were to look from the outside, one could only see the towering, ancient stone walls.</p>
 <p>Following the formation of the circular shape of the stone walls, the stone walls seemed to have gradually become smooth. An increasing amount of light rays were reflected by the mirror-like stone walls. Finally, they gathered at this hole in the ground. The bright, dazzling light was extremely glaring.</p>
 <p>Although the sunlight had gathered, not the slightest bit of fire seedlings were emitted from the hole in the ground. Hence, the so-called Sun Flame did not appear. Fortunately, the light and hot energy of this altar were becoming more intense with the gathering of the sunlight. In the end, the Little Fairy Doctor’s eyebrows were slightly vertical. This sunlight left a searing feeling when it landed on her body.</p>
 <p>“Sizzle sizzle!”</p>
 <p>Wave after wave of grayish-purple poison fog gradually surged out of the Little Fairy Doctor beyond her control. After which, they collided with the hot sunlight in the outside world and emitted a sizzling sound.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to panic…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan comforted her and smiled as he looked at the Little Fairy Doctor, who had her hands clenched. He waved his hand and a crystal that was filled with a wild and violent energy appeared in front of him. It was the Monster Core of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan flipped his hand after taking out the Monster Core. A jade box appeared in it. The jade box was snow-white in color. There was a faint cold air seeping out of it. A jade-green color as well as a sticky substance, that was still wiggling, appeared in Xiao Yan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Xiao Yan had spent a great amount of effort in order to obtain this unique treasure. It was one of the key ingredients for the so-called Poison Dan method!</p>
 <p>“It is rumored that this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva can sense the Bodhisattva Heart… however, ever since I got ahold of it, this thing has not given me the slightest clue.” Xiao Yan looked at the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva in the jade box and helplessly shook his head. After which, his eyes landed on the Little Fairy Doctor in front of him as he continued with a solemn voice, “I will use three types of Heavenly Flame to force the Poison Qi within your body to a certain spot. The process will be very painful. You must endure it! If we cannot even progress past this step, the remaining steps… cannot begin.”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor clenched her silver teeth as she looked at Xiao Yan’s grave expression. She gently nodded. She knew that Xiao Yan had spent a couple years of effort in order to help her resolve this Woeful Poison Body. Now that they had everything ready, she would definitely endure regardless of how painful it would be. Otherwise, how could she be worthy of the effort that this person in front of her had put in over the years.</p>
 <p>“I will need to undo the seal within your body and completely unleash the Woeful Poison Body…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath. His hand involuntarily trembled a little. Should he fail to suppress the Woeful Poison Body, it was likely that the Little Fairy Doctor would die on the spot.</p>
 <p>“I trust you…”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor appeared to be aware of the worry in Xiao Yan’s heart after seeing his somewhat trembling hands. An alluring smile surfaced on her pretty face as she softly uttered encouraging words.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly tightened his hand. His voice was deep, “I have already prepared for today for many years, and I will definitely not make a mistake!”</p>
 <p>“Remove your clothes. I will begin undoing the seal!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was serious. His mind was the most focused it had ever been as he commanded in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor was startled when she heard his command. A redness swiftly flew onto her pretty face. However, when she saw Xiao Yan’s expression, which was so solemn to the point it did not possess any other emotion, she gently clenched her silver teeth. In any case, this fellow had already seen her many times. She did not mind allowing him to see her another time!</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor gently removed her clothes while possessing this thought that caused her face to redden. After which, her dress fell past her lovely, white, smooth skin. A suet-jade-like, perfect figure was exposed under this hot sunlight.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how sturdy Xiao Yan’s heart was, his eyes involuntarily flickered for a moment when he saw the perfect body of the woman in front of his eyes being exposed. However, he swiftly focused his mind. His eyes gathered on the Little Fairy Doctor’s body. Her suet-jade-like body possessed numerous faint-red scars. These scars were composed of a countless number of symbols that climbed all over the Little Fairy Doctor’s body, forming a perfect seal in the process.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan curled his fingers. A jade-green flame formed over his fingertip. His eyes focused as his hand swung at a lightning-like speed. After which, it heavily pressed on the Little Fairy Doctor’s smooth abdomen. A sizzling white smoke was emitted. The faint-red scar, that spread all over her body, slowly began to wiggle under his finger. The scar swiftly paled..</p>
 <p>Wave after wave of frightening deep-grayish poison fog erupted from the Little Fairy Doctor’s body after this symbol swiftly paled. Her grayish-purple eyes gradually turned pure-gray.</p>
 <p>This kind of grayish color contained the scent of death. It was without even the slightest bit of life. At a glance, one would feel a fluttering feeling that seemed to have spread from deep within their soul.</p>
 <p>When the Woeful Poison Body completely erupted, this kind of grayish color would swiftly devour all of the lifeforce belonging to its owner!</p>
 <p>The bright redness on the Little Fairy Doctor’s face swiftly vanished following the spread of this grayish-colored poison fog. Her originally gentle face slowly became expressionless. However, the pain and struggle that faintly seeped from between her eyebrows indicated that she was resisting the backlash of the Woeful Poison Body.</p>
 <p>They were both pressed for time. A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s mind as a jade-green flame was spat out of his mouth. The dark-black ring on his finger gradually trembled. A dense-white-colored flame slowly curled and rose.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grabbed this cluster of dense-white flames. He stuffed it into his jade-green flame. The three types of flames underwent a drastic change the moment they made contact. However, Xiao Yan had already mastered this kind of change. He spent a short moment before he completely merged the three types of flames.</p>
 <p>The final creation from the merger of the three types of Heavenly Flames was a pure-green-white flame. It slowly rose while waves of destructive strength slowly spread from it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment after the successful merger of the three types of Heavenly Flames. He glanced at the gray poison fog that was surging out of the Little Fairy Doctor’s body in front of him. He then inhaled a deep breath of air. He waved his hand and the green-white flame surged out. It expanded and bundled around the Little Fairy Doctor’s body.</p>
 <p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle sizzle!</p>
 <p>The flame had just covered the Little Fairy Doctor when the dense, gray-colored poison gas around her body emitted an intense sizzling sound, as though it had met its nemesis. After which, it withdrew with lightning-like speed, fleeing back into the Little Fairy Doctor’s body!</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor’s grayish-purple eyes immediately turned a pure gray color when the poison gas entered her body. A deadly aura radiated out of her. The Little Fairy Doctor’s body moved and charged out of this altar!</p>
 <p>However, Xiao Yan was already prepared for this. The Little Fairy Doctor’s body had just moved when he suddenly stood up. His hand was covered in the green-white flame as it pressed onto the Little Fairy Doctor’s shoulder, violently holding her down in the process!</p>
 <p>“Gather!”</p>
 <p>The seal formed by Xiao Yan’s hand changed as he furiously cried out!</p>
 <p>The green-white flame transformed into countless numbers of tiny fire seedlings after the cry sounded. They penetrated the Little Fairy Doctor’s skin and entered her body. Finally, they wildly chased after the gray-colored poison gas!</p>
 <p>The green-white fire seedlings from all directions covered every corner of the Little Fairy Doctor’s body. Fortunately, Xiao Yan’s current strength was much stronger than before. Otherwise, it was likely that he would have found it difficult to control so many fire seedlings.</p>
 <p>The permeating gray poison gas began to swiftly scatter after being chased by the fire seedlings. Moreover, under the control of Xiao Yan’s mind, all of the poison gas gathered in the Little Fairy Doctor’s lower abdomen.</p>
 <p>Hiss hiss hiss hiss hiss hiss!</p>
 <p>Slight sounds were continuously emitted from the Little Fairy Doctor’s body. Wave after wave of gray-colored poison gas hurriedly fled from the combined might of the three Heavenly Flames. Finally, the gas was chased to her lower abdomen. All the green-white flames gathered at this spot. They transformed into a fire circle that trapped the poison gas within.</p>
 <p>The vast, mighty poison gas, that was filled with a deadly aura, gathered in the Little Fairy Doctor’s lower abdomen. At a glance, it looked like a swirl. The interior of the swirl was a deadly world. Even an elite Dou Zun would not dare to easily face such a frightening poison gas head-on. If Xiao Yan had not been relying on the strength of three types of Heavenly Flames, he would have been eroded by this kind of poison gas into nothing with just the first contact. There was no need to even talk about driving it away.</p>
 <p>“Gathering the poison gas, replacing it with the Monster Core, and using the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly sighed after sensing the poison gas that had gathered together. He suddenly grabbed the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast’s crystal Monster Core, and he placed it on the Little Fairy Doctor’s lower abdomen!</p>
 <p>The crystal had just made contact with the Little Fairy Doctor’s skin when she strangely emitted an unusual glow. After which, the crystal slowly merged with her skin!</p>
 <p>The Monster Core was strangely swallowed by the Little Fairy Doctor’s skin, soon entering the swirl of gray poison gas. After which, it lingered in the middle of the swirl!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression became graver after the successful insertion of the Monster Core. His eyes slid to the jade box beside him, where the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was located. The next step was the most important one…</p>
