 <p>“Clamor!”</p>
 <p>The entire square once again emitted wave after wave of uproars as they looked at the sudden scene that appeared in the sky. Numerous shocked eyes slid to the jade-green fire dragon surging out of Xiao Yan’s body. This fire was unafraid of even the other party’s Heavenly Flame. Clearly, this jade-green flame should also be a kind of Heavenly Flame. Moreover, its position on the Heavenly Flame Ranking was likely even higher than the deep-blue flame of Old Mu Gu.</p>
 <p>The roaring jade-green flame was clearly targeting Old Mu Gu. Hence, the other alchemists did not feel too much of a disruption. However, they still sensed the flame within their medicinal cauldron become much more violent when the roar sounded. Their expressions immediately changed. They were quite helpless in the face of the Heavenly Flames, which were the strongest of all flames…</p>
 <p>Xuan Kong Zi and the others on the tall stage revealed shocked expressions in their eyes when they saw the jade-green fire dragon that Xiao Yan had summoned. Their eyebrows were knit together a moment later as they talked somewhat uncertainly, “If I have guessed correctly, the Heavenly Flame of the black-clothed person should be the Sea Heart Flame ranked fifteenth. That jade-green Heavenly Flame of Xiao Yan should be ranked even higher than the Sea Heart Flame, but why is it that I feel an unfamiliar with it?”</p>
 <p>“There is indeed something not quite right. Although there are colors among the top fifteen flames that are similar to it, it is still possible to find a lot of differences if one were to carefully compare them.” The pretty woman nodded slightly and replied with surprise, “Could it be that this little fellow has found a new Heavenly Flame?”</p>
 <p>Endless nature hid a countless amount of secrets. A natural item like the Heavenly Flame was even more mysterious. The Heavenly Flame Ranking might possess a great authority, but it did not mean the Heavenly Flames of this world were only limited to what was ranked. Hence, the pretty woman had made this conjecture.</p>
 <p>“I’m not certain. However, I can pick up scent of the Green Lotus Core Flame within the jade-green flame, yet the position of the Green Lotus Heart Flame is a little behind that of the Sea Heart Flame. How could it possibly cause the Sea Heart Flame to fear it?” That dark-skinned Elder revealed an expression of thought as he replied.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, looks like this little fellow possesses many secrets. The Pill Gathering this time around is going to be very interesting. It has been many years since a battle between Heavenly Flames has appeared…” Xuan Kong Zi faintly smiled, but he did not probe too much into the matter.</p>
 <p>The pretty woman and the dark-skinned Elder slowly nodded upon hearing his words.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Old Mu Gu glanced at the deep-blue flame that had shrunk back into his hand. After which, his eyes stared at the distant Xiao Yan in a dense manner. He let out a cold snort and once again withdrew his gaze. He flicked his finger and the flame stood in the interior of his medicinal cauldron. At this moment, he did not have the time to bother with Xiao Yan. Once he had finished all of his tasks, he would take good care of this hateful fellow.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled after having shaved down Old Mu Gu’s spirit. He finally withdrew his eyes. With a wave of his hand, the bright-red Ten Thousand Beast Cauldron appeared in front of him. He gently waved his sleeves and the jade-green fire dragon rushed down from the sky. Finally, it entered the medicinal cauldron. A fierce flame swiftly caused the ice-cold medicinal cauldron’s temperature to rise.</p>
 <p>After the temperature within the medicinal cauldron gradually rose, Xiao Yan’s hand rubbed through the air and numerous medicinal ingredients immediately flew out of his Storage Ring. Finally, they remained suspended around his stone stage. At a brief glance, it was likely there were a hundred of them. The degree of complication in the refinement of a medicinal pill at the tier of the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill was unimaginable. If someone whose spiritual control failed to meet the criteria attempted it, it was likely one would have a headache by just simply looking at the many medicinal ingredients. The thing that gave one an even greater headache was that one needed to use a frighteningly accurate method to refine it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan shook his hand after having taken out these ingredients. Three jade boxes appeared before gently floating in front of him. The interior of these jade boxes contained the three key medicinal ingredients needed to refine the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression became grave after preparing everything. The Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill was the highest tier medicinal pill would be the highest tier of pill he had ever attempted. It was also the toughest. If one were careless, one’s ending would likely be extremely miserable. After all, something like pill refinement would frequently cause one to fall from the heavens into hell within a moment.</p>
 <p>The refinement method of the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill quietly flowed around Xiao Yan’s mind like flowing water. All the details that he needed to pay attention to were being firmly remembered in Xiao Yan’s heart…</p>
 <p>“Hu…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan exhaled a deep breath of air. His narrowed eyes were slightly opened and a sternness flashed across them. With a wave of his sleeves, a couple of medicinal ingredients were separated from the bulk and tossed into the medicinal cauldron one after another.</p>
 <p>Once the medicinal ingredients entered the medicinal cauldron, they swiftly withered under the terrifying temperature of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame. After which, under Xiao Yan’s extremely powerful spiritual control, the couple of medicinal ingredients were refined into pure medicinal powder within a short ten minutes. They were left gently suspended in a corner of the medicinal cauldron after a thought flashed through Xiao Yan’s mind…</p>
 <p>After having refined the first batch of pure medicinal powder with the fastest speed, Xiao Yan’s expression did not change. His hand continued to wave and medicinal ingredients began to continuously rush into the medicinal cauldron. However, regardless of just how numerous and messy these medicinal ingredients were, they were unable to cause Xiao Yan to feel any panic. Moreover, the good thing about having advanced to a tier 8 alchemist was finally beginning to expose itself. Xiao Yan could clearly sense the flame would immediately change with his thought when he refined medicinal ingredients. After which, it would refine the medicinal ingredient to the highest purity.</p>
 <p>The thing that caused Xiao Yan to feel the greatest surprise was that these medicinal ingredients that he had refined seemed to have been vaguely mixed with a trace of extremely faint spiritual aura. Although this kind of spiritual aura was extremely faint, it was still able to quietly but significantly improve the medicinal powder refined.</p>
 <p>“A tier 8 alchemist is indeed extraordinary…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt joy flash across his heart when he sensed the small spiritual auras. This little spiritual aura, that was mixed in, should not be underestimated. The medicinal pill that was eventually refined by using these medicinal powders would definitely be more than a level higher in quality when compared with a similar medicinal pills that were refined by tier 7 alchemists.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had swiftly refined one-third of the medicinal ingredient into medicinal powders and medicinal liquids within a short half an hour or so.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was still extremely solemn while refining these many medicinal ingredients. He gently exhaled a breath of air as his eyes turned to the three jade boxes in front of him. He could squander the other medicinal ingredients as he pleased. However, he tried his best to be careful when it came to these three key ingredients.</p>
 <p>A jade box flew away with a flick of Xiao Yan’s finger, revealing a jade-green, dry vine. A rich life force spread out of it. This thing was one of the key items used to refine the Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill, the Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment as he looked at this dry vine. He waved his hand and threw it into his medicinal cauldron. He hurriedly focus his mind on controlling the flame.</p>
 <p>The flame fiercely burned within the medicinal cauldron. That seemingly weak Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine did not show the slightest change even after being subjected to such a high temperature. If one were to look carefully, one would be able to discover a slight fluorescent light being emitted from the dry vine, isolating it from the high temperature.</p>
 <p>All the intelligent beings on the continent possessed an ability to protect themselves. This did not cause Xiao Yan to be surprised. As long as he persisted during this stalemate, he would sooner or later be able to refine this Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly shut his eyes while maintaining his flame. If he wanted to refine this Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine, the time needed would likely be a lot…</p>
 <p>Of course, things were indeed just as Xiao Yan had expected. This refinement lasted for nearly half a day or so. Only then did the Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine gradually break apart. Droplets of a jade-green liquid had become partially visible within the crevices.</p>
 <p>After the surface of the Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine had been broken, everything else had become much more relaxing. The Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine eventually transformed into a cluster of emerald-green liquid after Xiao Yan spent another hour. It remained suspended in the flame as though it possessed some life, slowly wiggling as it did so.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he looked at the emerald liquid that this Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine had transformed into. He immediately waved his hand and the many medicinal powders and medicinal liquids suspended in the corner of the medicinal cauldron swiftly rushed forth. They were all thrown into the emerald-colored liquid under the control of Xiao Yan’s grave face…</p>
 <p>This initial merger step was done quite perfectly by Xiao Yan. Around an hour or so, a cluster of liquid items surfaced in the jade-green flame.</p>
 <p>The first refinement step had been successful. Even Xiao Yan himself was quite surprised at this point. However, he also understood that the reason he had been able to reach this stage was mostly because his soul had advanced to the Soul State in the Pill Realm. In the past, things would not have been so smooth even if he could succeed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan rested a little after completing the first step. After which, he placed all of his attention on the even more complicated subsequent refinements.</p>
 <p>Many stone platforms were suspended in the sky. All the competitors within those stone platforms were currently controlling their flames with grave faces as they refined a medicinal pill within their own medicinal cauldrons. The entire place was very quiet. Countless numbers of gazes were gathered on these busy people in the sky…</p>
 <p>They were waiting for the arrival of the final day…</p>
 <p>The Pill Gathering would reach its climax at that time!</p>
 <p>The champion of the Pill Gathering would also appear on that day!</p>
 <p>Although the wait was dull, everything was worthwhile for the most exciting moment of their lives!</p>
