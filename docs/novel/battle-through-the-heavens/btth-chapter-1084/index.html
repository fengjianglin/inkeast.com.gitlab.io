 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1084: Refining A Body</u></strong></p>
 <p>A hot air wave was flowing to and fro within the quiet small valley, causing the poison fog in the air to continuously pale..</p>
 <p>There was a human figure sitting on an enormous rock in the valley. An enormous, crimson medicinal cauldron was suspended in the air in front of the figure. Jade-green flames burned fiercely within the cauldron. The hot air wave of the valley was spreading from this place…</p>
 <p>A couple of human figures were standing a hundred meters away from this enormous rock. Their gazes were gathered on the medicinal cauldron.</p>
 <p>“It has already been six days…”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan looked at the focused human figure on the enormous rock, sighed softly, and commented.</p>
 <p>“A tier 7 medicinal pill is not easy to refine. Naturally, one must spend some time…” The Little Fairy Doctor was not surprise. She softly said, “Moreover, the Pill Qi within the medicinal cauldron is becoming denser. It is likely that it will not be long until the pill is formed.”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan nodded when she heard the Little Fairy Doctor’s explanation. She was just about to speak when the medicinal cauldron, a short distance away, suddenly shook. A clear buzzing sound rippled from it and reverberated over the valley.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” This unexpected change caused the Little Fairy Doctor and the others to hurriedly throw their gazes over.</p>
 <p>An unusually dense Pill Qi suddenly spat out from the medicinal cauldron like a volcano after it emitted a buzzing sound. One could vaguely see the origin of the Pill Qi seemed to be from a round medicinal pill wrapped in a jade-green flame…</p>
 <p>“Is it about to form a pill?”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor felt joyful when she sensed the density of this Pill Qi.</p>
 <p>In front of the focus of the Little Fairy Doctor’s group, the Pill Qi being spat out from the medicinal cauldron became denser. In the end, almost the entire valley was permeated by this pill fragrance that braced one’s attention. Clearly, this was an indication that a pill was about to be formed.</p>
 <p>Although the Yin Yang Life Soul Pill was at the tier 7 middle grade level, it was not very difficult to refine. Additionally, with the experience of having aided Tang Zhen in refining the Fire Bodhisattva Pill, the refinement this time around was unexpectedly smooth. Everything seemed to progress naturally and not even the slightest mistake appeared along the way.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly opened his narrowed eyes while the Pill Qi spewed forth. He looked at this scene and a pleased expression surfaced on his face.</p>
 <p>The spewing Pill Qi became fiercer. In the end, it broke through the layer of poison fog in the sky. Having been summoned by this dense Pill Qi, dark clouds swiftly began to gather in the sky…</p>
 <p>A joy immediately appeared in Xiao Yan’s eyes when he saw this scene. He did not expect the Yin Yang Life Soul Pill to attract Pill Lightning.</p>
 <p>Pill Lightning, that was the greatest headache for alchemist, was something that Xiao Yan loved to see because his Earth Demon Puppet would be strengthened after a Pill Lightning Refinement. The last time around, the Earth Demon Puppet was strengthened to the point that it could contend with an eight star Dou Zong. Xiao Yan wondered just what level the Earth Demon Puppet would reach if it was to experience Pill Lightning again.</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan excitedly summoned the Earth Demon Puppet once again, the dark clouds that had gathered in the sky suddenly paused. After which, they became distorted. Although there were some muffled thunderous sounds, a scene where lightning cut through the distant air and fell did not occur. Instead, after some squirming, the dark clouds gradually scattered…</p>
 <p>The sudden scattering of the Pill Lightning was just like a basin of cold water being splashed on Xiao Yan’s head, extinguishing all of his excitement.</p>
 <p>“This… why did the Pill Lightning disappear by itself?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was stunned as he looked at the dark clouds in the air before he bitterly laughed a moment later.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Xiao Yan, the poison fog within the Fallen God Stream is far too dense. Perhaps it is because the poison vapor has covered the Pill Qi, causing the Pill Lightning to fail to find its target and ended up scattering by itself…” The Little Fairy Doctor’s group was also stunned by this scene. After which, Xin Lan mused for a moment before finally crying out loud.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan could only nod his head when he heard this. After his earlier absent-mindedness, his heart understood what had occurred was indeed partly due to the poison vapor covering the land here. However, there was another reason. It was that the Yin Yang Life Soul Pill was unable to attract Pill Lightning. This kind of medicinal pill might be considered a tier 7 middle grade pill, but strictly speaking, it had only barely reached the middle grade. If it was not due to the unique effects of the pill, it would be only a tier 7 low grade level. The Pill Qi that it emitted was perhaps unable to attract Pill Lightning. This, along with the poisonous vapor hiding, caused the Pill Lightning to gradually scatter after it had appeared.</p>
 <p>“Unlucky… however, I’m pressed for time and don’t have the time to deal with Pill Lightning…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly voiced his unluckiness in his heart before he waved his hand. The black-red medicinal pill within the medicinal cauldron was sucked out.</p>
 <p>“This is the Yin Yang Life Soul Pill huh…” Xiao Yan’s eyes observed the medicinal pill in his hand as he muttered to himself.</p>
 <p>This medicinal pill was the size of a dragon’s eye. It was both black and red in color. It had a rounded surface that contained a brilliant luster. When one’s hand rubbed over it, one would feel an icy coldness on one side while the other was warm, causing one to feel a great comfort.</p>
 <p>“Since the medicinal pill has been successfully refined, next will be the refinement of the body…” Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of air. He randomly stored away the medicinal cauldron and waved his hand. A corpse that was covered in ice appeared. This corpse was that of Yun Shan from the Misty Cloud Sect. Originally, Xiao Yan had prepared it for Yao Lao back then. However, a corpse of this level could no longer catch Xiao Yan’s eyes. It would be used to conduct an experiment.</p>
 <p>After summoning the corpse, the body refining method that Yao Lao had taught Xiao Yan flowed into his mind. A moment later, he quietly nodded. He waved his hand and an invisible wind dragged the corpse, suspending it in the air.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and a wisp of Glazed Lotus Heart Flame appeared. It emitted a ‘puff’ sound as wrapped around the corpse. The cold ice on the corpse swiftly melted under the frighteningly high temperature of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame…</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, hand me a thread of Spiritual Strength!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice as he looked at the ice that swiftly scattered.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, a thread of Spiritual Strength was immediately separated from between Tian Huo zun-zhe’s brows. After which, this Spiritual Strength drifted to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grabbed the Spiritual Strength and randomly tossed it into the corpse. After which, the Yin Yang Life Soul Pill was tossed to Tian Huo zun-zhe. “Consume it. Once I give the word, you should immediately enter this body!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe nodded with a grave expression. He stuffed the medicinal pill into his mouth without any hesitation. An excitement was flickering in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan swiftly took out a jade bottle from his Storage Ring after seeing that Tian Huo zun-zhe had consumed the medicinal pill. The interior of the jade bottle was filled with a purple-red-colored blood. A shockingly wild and violent energy seeped out of it. This was the Essence Blood of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand squeezed with a great force and the jade bottle burst apart. The large cluster of liquid blood scattered. With a wave of Xiao Yan’s hand, all of the blood landed on the body surrounded by flames.</p>
 <p>Waves of sizzling sounds were suddenly emitted when the liquid blood had just made contact with the corpse. One could see the skin of the corpse began to swiftly rot.</p>
 <p>This change did not cause Xiao Yan’s expression to alter. After an indifferent glance, Xiao Yan commanded the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame and suddenly increased its temperature…</p>
 <p>Following the increase in the temperature of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the blood that adhered to the corpse began to slowly seep into it in a strange manner. The originally pale-white flesh was gradually filled with life when the Essence Blood merged with it…</p>
 <p>Around half an hour after the Essence Blood gradually merged into the corpse, ‘Yun Shan’s’ tightly shut eyes were suddenly opened. His empty eyes contained a fluctuating lifeforce. Of course, this life force was not Yun Shan’s lifeforce. Instead, it was due to the thread of soul from Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>When ‘Yun Shan’ opened his eyes, Xiao Yan suddenly let out a deep cry, “Old mister Yao, enter!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe, who had already been waiting for the order by the side, was filled with excitement when he heard Xiao Yan’s cry. After which, his illusionary figure rushed into the corpse. After which, he penetrated through the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame and pounced into the corpse, which was covered in a red-colored glow.</p>
 <p>A strange black-red ripple emitted from the middle of Tian Huo zun-zhe’s brows the moment his soul made contact with the corpse. The ripple spread at lightning-like speed as it covered the entire body.</p>
 <p>“Puff!”</p>
 <p>The soul of Tian Huo zun-zhe and the corpse suddenly collided as the black-red ripple spread. This time around, the collision did not repel the soul. Instead, the soul slowly merged into the body…</p>
 <p>“Is it successfully completed?”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan and the Little Fairy Doctor by the side were unable to control their joy as they asked after seeing Tian Huo zun-zhe’s soul merge with the body.</p>
 <p>“Not yet. Old mister Yao must endure the burning of the Heavenly Flame and gradually obtain control of the body. Only then can he be considered to have truly revived from the flames.” Xiao Yan’s expression was solemn as he shook his head. The subsequent step was the most important one. If Tian Huo zun-zhe was unable to endure the burning of the Heavenly Flame, it was likely that not only would this physical body be wasted but his soul would also suffer a fatal blow.</p>
 <p>“The both of you should head to the entrance of the valley and stand guard there. The Earth Demon Puppet will aid you. Remember, do not allow anyone to enter!” Xiao Yan instructed them in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor and Xin Lan nodded when they heard him. They grabbed the Earth Demon Puppet and slowly stepped back. Finally, they came to a stop at the entrance of the valley.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan turned his gaze away after seeing this. He looked at the corpse with a painful expression, burning within the Heavenly Flame in the air. His fist slowly tightened. “You must endure!”</p>
 <p>The burning of the Heavenly Flame continued for two days. Even though this was the case, the flame burning outside of the corpse did not disappear. However, the pain on the face of the corpse was gradually reduced, perhaps as a result of it having become numb. Moreover, a hidden mighty aura was quietly brewing within the body…</p>
 <p>Another day passed. On this day, the slight sound of rushing wind suddenly appeared a distance from the valley that had been quiet for a long while. A moment later, a white-clothed man carrying a snake-shaped walking stick slowly appeared at a spot around a hundred meters from the entrance of the valley. Many white figures appeared one after another behind him…</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, the poison fog of this Fallen God Valley is really too dense. It even hid the scent of the Monster Core. However… we have finally found them.”</p>
 <p>The old man holding the snake-shaped walking stick looked at the valley. His smile was exceptionally dense.</p>
