 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1122: Betting</u></strong></p>
 <p>A faint, cold laugh sounded within the front yard, causing Cao Dan’s expression to become much darker and more solemn. He turned his head, and his eyes landed on a door leading to the front yard. Two figures slowly appeared at that spot…</p>
 <p>“I was wondering why the Ye clan had suddenly become so firm. It has found quite a number of helpers…” Cao Dan watched Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor as they slowly walked over. The corner of his mouth moved slightly as he spoke with a cold laugh.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at this man in front of him, who appeared quite young. His eyes paused for a moment on the badge on his chest and some surprise flashed across them. This Cao clan was indeed worthy of being an alchemist family. The younger generation that it had groomed was actually this strong.</p>
 <p>It was the first time in all these years that Xiao Yan had seen such a young tier 7 alchemist!</p>
 <p>Of course, Xiao Yan did not feel surprise that the other party was able to gain such an achievement. The continent was very vast and there would definitely be some pill refining geniuses. This, along with the grooming of an alchemist family like the Cao clan from a young age, their achievements would naturally be far from what an ordinary alchemist could compare with.</p>
 <p>“If I remember correctly, you should be called Xiao Yan right? This person is the Woeful Poison Lady who stirred a great commotion within the Pill Region?” Cao Dan’s eyes lingered over Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor before speaking with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stopped beside Tian Huo zun-zhe. He smiled and softly said, “The style of the Cao clan is indeed quite grand…”</p>
 <p>“Mister Xiao Yan, this person is called Cao Dan. He is known as a pill refinement genius that comes once in a hundred years within the Cao clan. Despite his young age, he has already reached the level of a tier 7 alchemist. He is also quite well-known in this Pill Region…” Ye Zhong softly explained who he was to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His eyes landed on Cao Dan and said, “Young master Cao Dan, the matter between the Ye and Cao clan is just a small grudge. Why don’t each of you take a step back?”</p>
 <p>A chill flashed across Cao Dan’s eyes as he looked at Xiao Yan’s smiling face. He faintly said, “Take a step back? How will my Cao clan account to the outside world? Back then, my Cao clan had made a public announcement after the Ye clan came to talk about this marriage. If we fail to marry now, would the Cao clan not lose a great amount of face? Can this still be considered a small grudge?”</p>
 <p>“In that case, young master Cao Dan is insisting on bringing her with you today?” Xiao Yan slowly took a step forward and softly laughed.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan narrowed his eyes in the face of Xiao Yan’s somewhat bullying demeanor. With his pill refining talent, seldom would any member of the younger generation treat him like this during all these years.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan not only did not take a step back as he looked at Xiao Yan in front of him; instead, he took a step forward. The gap between Xiao Yan and him was a short foot. His eyes stared at Xiao Yan as he said, “Xiao Yan, I have heard about you and know that you are able to fight, but you should get things right. My Cao clan is not the Ice River Valley. As long as my Cao clan utters the word, even you would likely feel an extreme headache.”</p>
 <p>“I even dared to kill a member of the ‘Hall of Souls.’ Do you think that your Cao clan is even more difficult to deal with than the Hall of Souls?” Xiao Yan slowly spread his five fingers as he calmly replied.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan’s expression finally changed upon hearing this. With the ability of the Cao clan to summon helpers, it could indeed be comparable to the Ice River Valley. However, by comparing it to the Hall of Souls… their Cao clan would lose that qualification. After all, the Hall of Souls stood shoulder to shoulder with the Pill Tower. Their Cao clan was merely relying on the Pill Tower. How could they be compared to the Hall of Souls?</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, I know that you are bold, but sometimes, you should be a little more rational. These people might not be able to bring Xin Lan away, but the next time we come, I believe that just the two elite Dou Zuns behind you would be of little use. My Cao clan does possess this ability…” With Cao Dan’s pride, it was naturally impossible for him to submit to Xiao Yan. Therefore, he immediately and coldly laughed as he responded in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Offending the Cao clan for the Ye clan is really not worthwhile! If you are willing, my Cao clan will welcome you as a friend!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He said, “Forget it, young master Cao Dan. What you have said does not attract me… please leave today. I will not hand Xin Lan to you.”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan! You better know the situation!”</p>
 <p>Cao Dan furiously cried out. His expression sank after being rejected by Xiao Yan in such a straightforward manner.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled. Both of his hands were crossed in front of him as he studied Cao Dan. He did not show any signs of giving in.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan’s expression became graver after being looked at by Xiao Yan in this manner. The gray-robed, old man’s wrinkle-filled face was scrunched. Immediately, he took a slow step forward!</p>
 <p>“You will remain behind if you take another step forward. Just this one star Dou Zun’s strength of yours does not have the qualification to behave atrociously here!”</p>
 <p>The gray-robed, old man had just stepped forward when the white figure in front of him flashed. A clear, cold voice was transmitted into his ears.</p>
 <p>The gray-clothed, old man’s expression changed slightly upon hearing her words. His eyes stared at the Little Fairy Doctor in front of him and a fearful expression flashed across them. He could sense that the Little Fairy Doctor was also an elite Dou Zun. Moreover, her level was likely even higher than his.</p>
 <p>The words of the Little Fairy Doctor had just sounded when it appeared to have broken the tense swords-drawn atmosphere. All the people from the Cao clan, including the two red-robed, old men suddenly took a few steps forward. Majestic auras rippled over this place like a wave, forming a great pressure!</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe let out a cold snort after seeing the two red-robed, old man step forward. He also took a step forward and appeared on Xiao Yan’s left side. A mighty aura surged out and suppressed the auras of nearly a hundred people on the opposite side!</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, why? Is young master Cao Dan planning to use force. However, just a one star Dou Zun alone does not appear to be able to suffice…” Xiao Yan faintly smiled as he commented.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, you should not be so pleased with yourself. Offending my Cao clan is not something fun. Even if we end up failing this time around, there will definitely be an even stronger lineup coming the next time around. What can you do at that time?” A cold glint flashed across Cao Dan’s eyes when he spoke. He turned his eyes to Ye Zhong’s group as he coldly laughed, “At that time, this group would at the very most just leave. However, the Ye clan will likely become the target for the Cao clan to vent its anger. It is likely that the Ye clan would be removed from the Pill Region in the future…”</p>
 <p>The expressions of Ye Zhong’s group involuntarily changed upon hearing this. However, what other path did the Ye clan have at this moment. If they lost Xiao Yan, the Ye clan would completely decline. Moreover, if they abandoned Xiao Yan and complied with the marriage between the Cao and Ye clan, it was likely that the Ye clan would also be removed very soon. Ye Zhong did not believe that the Cao clan would genuinely help the Ye clan recover its former glory. The reason the Cao clan was acting in this manner was merely to swallow the Ye clan and strengthen the Cao clan…</p>
 <p>“The Ye clan will act on mister Xiao Yan’s orders!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhong’s eyes flickered for a moment before he made up his mind. After which, he cupped his hands respectfully to Xiao Yan’s back and spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan’s expression turned gloomier upon seeing him bow. His voice was dark and cold as he said, “Alright, you, Ye Zhong, are really becoming bolder and bolder!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhong was too lazy to bother with Cao Dan’s cynicism. No matter what the case was, a grudge between the Ye and Cao clan had indeed been formed…</p>
 <p>“Young master Cao Dan, please leave!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan spoke in a calm voice. Ye Zhong’s choice had caused him to be a little surprised. This old fellow had placed all of his chips on Xiao Yan. If anything happened to Xiao Yan midway through, it was likely that the Ye clan would be completely finished.</p>
 <p>Cao Dan’s expression was volatile. He would not simply be chased away empty-handed. However, if he wanted to use force, the other party had two elite Dou Zuns and need not fear his side…</p>
 <p>After musing for a long while, Cao Dan’s eyes suddenly swept over Xiao Yan’s body. He inquired, “It is rumored that you are also an alchemist?”</p>
 <p>“I do know something about pill refining…” Xiao Yan randomly replied. It seemed that this fellow was indeed unwilling to simply give up.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you dare to make a bet with me? If I lose, the Cao clan can choose not to have this marriage. However, if I win, you will not get involved in this matter. What do you say?” A cold smile flashed across Cao Dan’s face as he asked.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrows. He appeared to be a little interested as he inquired with a smile, “May I know how young master Cao Dan is intending to gamble?”</p>
 <p>The cold smile in Cao Dan’s heart swiftly widened after seeing Xiao Yan show some interest. If they were to really fight with Dou Qi, it was likely that he would not be a match for Xiao Yan. However, if it came to competing with pill refinement skill… he would let Xiao Yan know that he was attempting to be impressive in front of a true master, seeking his own humiliation in the process.</p>
 <p>Ridicule flashed across Cao Dan’s heart. However, the smile on his face appeared brilliant as he replied, “Since we are both alchemists, we naturally cannot fight like those chuffs. We should follow the rules of alchemists… let’s challenge each other in terms of playing with fire.”</p>
 <p>A cluster of faint-black flames suddenly rose from Cao Dan’s hand once his words sounded. Immediately, the cluster wiggled in his palm. It transformed into two dark-black, small snakes that continuously slid around his finger, appearing as obedient as spirits…</p>
 <p>“Mister Xiao Yan, do not promise him. Cao Dan possesses an unusually great talent when it came to controlling flames. Even in the Cao clan, one can count the number of people who surpass him with one’s fingers!” Ye Zhong hurriedly piped in upon hearing Cao Dan’s words.</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard this. It was unexpected that Cao Dan possessed such a talent in terms of flame control…</p>
 <p>“What do you say? If you don’t dare accept the challenge, you can just say the word. I am not a person who will make things difficult for others…” Cao Dan stared at Xiao Yan as he coldly smiled.</p>
 <p>“The words ‘make things difficult for others’ really appear a little comical when uttered from your mouth…” Xiao Yan grinned and shook his head, ignoring Cao Dan’s sinking expression.</p>
 <p>“Don’t use your glib tongue. Are you going to compete? If you are not, I might end up returning with nothing. However, the people who will arrive next time will not be so easy to deal with…” Cao Dan coldly said. He felt some fury leaping within his heart when he saw the smile on Xiao Yan’s face.</p>
 <p>“Since you like it… I will accompany you…” Xiao Yan smiled. That smile contained a cunningness no matter how one looked at it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had never competed with others in terms of playing with fire before. However, the only thing he was aware of was that he specialized in this…</p>
