 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1004: Sonic Wave Face Off</u></strong></p>
 <p>After Xiao Yan’s feet stepped onto the rock stairs, the densely packed Gold Swallowing Mice around the rock stairs immediately opened their eyes. The hair on their bodies stood erect as a powerful sonic wave suddenly appeared, causing the energy in this place to swiftly fluctuate.</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran clenched her silver teeth after seeing Xiao Yan enter the rock stairs. She merely lifted her head and followed.</p>
 <p>“Follow me!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze stared intently at the Gold Swallowing Mice around the rock stairs. An instant later, his throat suddenly emitted a low roar. His feet stomped violently on the ground after his roar sounded, and he transformed into a light figure, which shot toward the mountain top in a lightning-like manner. Behind him, Nalan Yanran also stimulated her Dou Qi to its limit and did her best to increase her speed while following close behind Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The people on the platform as well as on the mountain top also swiftly threw their gazes over when they saw Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran begin. Since the beginning, there had not been a precedent of people successfully passing the checkpoint in groups of two or more individuals. Everyone clearly understood that the strength of this so-called mouse tide sound array was determined by the number of people in the group. Now that Xiao Yan was challenging this checkpoint in a group of two, the sonic wave’s strength would naturally be double its ordinary strength. Under such a sonic wave attack, it was likely that even Feng Qing Er and the others would have some difficulty passing through it.</p>
 <p>Hence, many people did not have much confidence that Xiao Yan would be able to charge through the checkpoint this time around. If he was alone, he might still have a chance. However, now that he was bringing along a burden, the result…</p>
 <p>Screech screech screech!</p>
 <p>After Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran had charged forward by nearly a hundred meters over the rock stairs, the ear-piercing sonic wave that was swiftly formed finally descended from the sky in an abrupt manner, appearing much like a storm. It entered through every single opening on Xiao Yan’s and Nalan Yanran’s bodies.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s and Nalan Yanran’s bodies stiffened almost at the same time when the sonic wave arrived. However, Xiao Yan was in a much better state. By relying on the great strength of his Dou Qi, he was able to forcefully endure it. Although his speed had been reduced, he was ultimately able to withstand it. However, Nalan Yanran the pretty face of Nalan Yanran behind him turned slightly pale. Her speed was quickly reduced as the ear-piercing sonic wave caused her soul to feel waves of piercing pain. The Dou Qi within her body also began to become disorderly.</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran tightly clenched her silver teeth. She looked at Xiao Yan’s back not far away from her and forcefully endured the pain from her soul that drilled into her heart. The Dou Qi in her body surged out without holding back, forming numerous defenses around her body as she tried her best to stop these sonic wave attacks.</p>
 <p>Two figures hurriedly flashed up the long rock stairs. The sonic waves from all directions seemed to possess a real form as they permeated every inch of the space around the rock stairs. Each time Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran advanced, they would exhaust a great amount of Dou Qi. Only then were they able to reach their destination.</p>
 <p>When they were observing earlier, it seemed that the entire journey would only take a short couple of minutes. It was unexpected that after personally giving it a try, they finally became aware just how troublesome and dangerous this thing actually was.</p>
 <p>Screech screech screech screech screech!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran finally charged through half of the distance of the rock stairs in front of everyone’s gazes. However, Nalan Yanran’s pretty face was extremely pale at this moment. Were it not for her perseverance, she would likely have found it difficult to endure to such an extent. It was a little too difficult for Nalan Yanran to breakthrough this mouse tide sound array with her current strength.</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran’s vision gradually became blurry. She looked at the figure in front of her, which appeared skinny. However, that figure was unusually stable amid the sonic wave. The corner of her mouth revealed a bitterness. She thought of the distant past when she used a haughty status to forcefully cancel the Xiao clan’s engagement. At that time, she might have been young and spoiled, but she knew in her heart that the reason for her actions were partly related to Xiao Yan’s reputation of being useless.</p>
 <p>At that time, she had been accepted into the Misty Cloud Sect and appeared to have a limitless future in the eyes of many. Xiao Yan, on the other hand, was merely a useless young master from a small clan. The gap between the two was just like that between the Heavens and Earth. Her arrogance back then naturally had difficulty enduring such a gap.</p>
 <p>However, it was also because of this impulse of hers that gave her this limitless regret. All the things she was proud of were completely destroyed as this young man grew one step at a time. Even her greatest support, the Misty Cloud Sect, was eventually forced to take that most miserable step under his cold and indifferent voice.</p>
 <p>Originally, she thought that she and this young man, who could not be removed from her memory, would become people from two separate worlds after she had left the Jia Ma Empire. However, she had not expected that the person who would step forward and rescue her when she met with danger would actually be him…</p>
 <p>In their encounter once again, his strength had truly surpassed her. Until now… her qualification to follow in his footsteps had also gradually disappeared. Nalan Yanran bit her lower lip tightly with the back of her teeth when she thought until this point. A thread of blood seeped out. Originally, the relationship between him and her had the chance to be able to reach the most intimate level. Unfortunately…</p>
 <p>Some regret that remained deep within her heart spread out like a poisonous snake, causing the bitterness in the corner of Nalan Yanran’s mouth to become denser. The dense Dou Qi on the surface of her body also became thinner under the assault of the sonic wave.</p>
 <p>“Grug grug!”</p>
 <p>At a certain instant, the Dou Qi suddenly completely disappeared. Nalan Yanran’s body suddenly stilled. Her pretty face was as white as snow. Immediately, she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Her eyes swiftly turned dark, and her body appeared to have suffered a serious blow as it fell down like a kite with its string cut.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, I have already done my best…”</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran slowly shut her eyes after sensing the exhausted Dou Qi within her body. A soft mutter sounded within her heart as she did so.</p>
 <p>Quite a number of people on the platform involuntarily shook their heads when they saw Nalan Yanran flying back after finally being unable to endure any longer. They involuntarily felt indignation toward Xiao Yan. He had brought such a beauty into the sound array, but was unable to give her any protection. This action was not like a man in the eyes of many people.</p>
 <p>“Acting conceited. Harming others and yourself.”</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er shook her head gently on the mountain top as she spoke with a faint ridiculing voice.</p>
 <p>“This person is quite strong. He has yet to reveal his true ability.” Tang Ying hesitated for a moment before slowly speaking.</p>
 <p>“Humph, you really think too highly of this brat.” Wang Chen curled his mouth and coldly laughed.</p>
 <p>“That might not be true. This person might be young, but even I cannot see through him. Moreover, he is able to escape from the hands of Fei Tian from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion. Although he had the help of external strength, it is likely that no one will believe that he does not have some ability.” Mu Qing Luan by the side covered her mouth and laughed with her lovely voice when she heard this.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A muffled thunder sound suddenly resonated from the rock stairs while the four people were conversing. Immediately, they saw Xiao Yan’s body suddenly crumbled under the sonic waves. The next time he appeared, he was already behind Nalan Yanran. He extended his arm and held her narrow waist.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Three Thousand Lightning Movement. It is really as the rumors say. This person has managed to learn the Wind Lightning Pavilion’s Three Thousand Lightning Movement from some unknown place. Looking at it now, this is indeed true.” Mu Qing Luan immediately spoke with surprise when she saw the disappearing afterimage and the thunderous roar.</p>
 <p>“He is just a little thief.” Feng Qing Er glanced indifferently at Mu Qing Luan. Her voice carried a thread of iciness.</p>
 <p>“A little thief will not be able to escape from the hands of the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion’s chief, Fei Tian.” Mu Qing Luan did not feel the least bit afraid of Feng Qing Er. Instead, she curled her small mouth and laughed softly.</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er’s eyebrows were bunched up together in the face of Mun Qing Luan’s tit for tat. However, due to the other party’s identity, she could only swing her sleeves and turned her cold gaze towards Xiao Yan on the rock stairs. She said, “In that case, I want to see just how he will bring a person and get through this mouse tide sound array!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan hugged Nalan Yanran’s waist in front of everyone’s eyes. His body paused in midair as his gaze focused intently on the densely packed Gold Swallowing Mouse below. A cold glint flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>“You should challenge the formation alone. I am unable to get through this large formation.” Nalan Yanran said. Her pale face revealed a bright redness upon having her soft waist hugged by Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Use your remaining Dou Qi to cover your ears. I said that I will lead you across the formation, and I will do it.” Xiao Yan spoke faintly.</p>
 <p>Nalan Yanran hesitated for a moment when she saw Xiao Yan’s insistence. All she could do was nod her head. After which, she used her remaining Dou Qi to swiftly cover both of her ears.</p>
 <p>Screech screech screech screech!</p>
 <p>The countless number of Gold Swallowing Mice below paused for a moment before suddenly raising their heads. Numerous gazes were locked onto Xiao Yan in the sky. Immediately, their teeth-filled mouths were swiftly opened. A sonic wave, even more frightening that the one earlier, was emitted like a thunderbolt.</p>
 <p>The faces of everyone on the platform changed as they sensed the strength of this sonic wave.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the substance-like sonic wave from the air. His mouth pulsed and his face turned a somewhat flushed red. An instant later, he suddenly opened his mouth!</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>A thunder like lion and tiger roar suddenly appeared in the sky. Enormous sound waves wrapped around the entire Heaven Eye Mountain. The shocking roar even contained a strange dragon roar, causing the soul of anyone who heard it to tremble. Their legs also involuntarily shook.</p>
 <p>“Dragon roar?”</p>
 <p>The passive face Jin Shi displayed changed expressions at this moment while he involuntarily cried out. That kind of sonic wave was not frightening. However, the thing that caused him to be most shocked was that a dragon roar was hidden in the cry. This kind of dragon roar was something that an ordinary Dou Skill could not imitate. Only some unique beast which truly possessed the bloodline of a dragon could emit it. However, Xiao Yan was a human…</p>
 <p>The enormous sonic wave swept around in front of numerous shocked gazes. It violently collided with the sonic wave from the mouse tide. After which, a completely one-sided disappearance occurred. What disappeared was the mouse tide sonic wave!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan relied on his own strength to destroy the sonic wave formed from a countless number of Gold Swallowing Mice head-on in this kind of sonic wave face off!</p>
 <p>This scene caused those people on the platform and the mountain top to instantly become stunned…</p>
 <p>“This… how is this possible?”</p>
