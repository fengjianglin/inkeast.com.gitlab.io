 <p><strong><u>Chapter 747: Helping Hand</u></strong></p>
 <p>A calm voice slowly reverberated over the training ground, causing the sharp cry to solidify at this moment. Everyone looked all around them. Their eyes were filled with many different emotions.</p>
 <p>The expression of the clan head of the He clan changed slightly the moment the voice sounded. The blunt matter of the other party’s words caused him to let out a cold snort. However, his feet did not continue to fall. Instead, he slowly withdrew it and spoke in a deep voice, “May I know which friend is here. This is a matter of my He clan. Please do not meddle in another’s business.”</p>
 <p>The eyes of the clan head of the He clan slowly swept all around when he spoke. However, he was actually unable to find traces of the person who spoke, causing his heart to slightly sink.</p>
 <p>“You are looking for me?” A slight thunderous roar suddenly resounded over the sky just as the eyes of the head of the He clan were looking around. A black figure slowly appeared in the training ground and spoke to the former with a smile.</p>
 <p>The black-robed figure that suddenly appeared caused the eyes on the head of the He clan to shrink slightly. This speed… his eyes slowly shifted upwards. Finally, they paused on that young face. He was immediately startled. The latter’s age had clearly caught him by surprise.</p>
 <p>The eyes of the pale-faced Ka Gang immediately emitted a wild joy upon seeing the black-robed human figure who had appeared. He struggled in an attempt to get up but did not succeed due to his injuries being too severe.</p>
 <p>Ka Gang’s actions immediately stirred up a commotion in the training ground. The many people from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company used happy gazes to look at the black-robed figure. Most of them had heard that the reason for the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company ability to avoid the disaster of being eliminated was because of the help of this mysterious expert.</p>
 <p>“He is that mysterious mister Xiao Yan?” That pale-faced middle-aged man’s gaze swept over that black robed figure as he softly asked Ling Er by the side whose pretty face had emitted joyful surprise.</p>
 <p>“Aye!” Ling Er nodded her head. Her eyes did not blink as they paused on that person’s back. Some life had surfaced in her despaired heart following the appearance of this black figure. For some unknown reason, she possessed an unknown confidence in this young person whom she did not have a deep feeling for.</p>
 <p>“However, he seems to be a little too young?” The middle-aged man’s position could coincidentally see the side of Xiao Yan’s face and he could not help but whisper.</p>
 <p>“He may be young but he is very strong!” Ling Er curled her mouth. She really disagreed with the way the middle-aged man used age to judge the other person’s strength.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged person laughed bitterly when he heard her response. He naturally hoped that this black-robed, young man would be as strong as possible. However, one must be realistic in everything. The clan head of the He clan was able to reach his current strength after having trained for an unknown number of years. From the looks of this black-robed, young man he was likely only around twenty years old even if one were to round up his age. This amount of training time, ugh…</p>
 <p>Even without mentioning the private conversations of the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company, the head of the He clan had paused his dark and solemn gaze on Xiao Yan after he had appeared. Given his strength, he was naturally unable to see the depth of Xiao Yan’s strength. However, the speed that the later just just displayed caused him to be a little afraid. Otherwise, it was likely that he would have instantly attacked and killed Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression was as still as an old well while the heart of the head of the He clan flickered. He pulled Ka Gang up from the ground and frowned a little upon seeing his pale-white face. After which, he stuffed a medicinal pill into the latter’s mouth and coldly laughed within his heart. This person’s attack was indeed heavy…</p>
 <p>Ka Gang’s pale expression became a little flushed red due to his agitation after swallowing the medicinal pill. His hands grabbed Xiao Yan’s sleeve, but he was unable to even speak a complete sentence because of his excitement.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and smiled to Ka Gang. He softly said, “Relax, uncle Ka Gang. Today, the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company will not have a single death.”</p>
 <p>“Hei, what arrogant words! Who exactly are you? Do you really intend to intervene in today’s matter?” The clan head of the He clan by the side immediately coldly laughed when he heard this. Those surrounding guards from the He clan pointed their sharp weapons in their hands toward Xiao Yan after the cold laughter sounded. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>The hearts of those people from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company immediately tightened when they sensed the tense atmosphere suddenly appearing in their surroundings. The pressure that the clan head of the He clan had forced on them was really too strong. Even random anger by the latter could cause them to be alarmed.</p>
 <p>However, with things having developed to this point, they could only pray in their hearts that this mysterious young man truly possessed the strength to contend with the head of the He clan. Otherwise, not only would none of the members of the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company luckily survive but even that young man would also be an innocent that was implicated by them.</p>
 <p>“You are very interested in those ‘Fire Lotus Bottles’ that I have created?” Xiao Yan ignored those dense, cold gazes from around him and glanced at the deep hole not far away before laughing faintly.</p>
 <p>The expression of the head of the He clan changed slightly upon hearing this. He could not help but cry out in surprise, “You created that thing?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>The head of the He clan revealed a greedy smile on his face when he saw this. He pointed at the many Bloody Battle Mercenary Company’s members on the training ground and smiled darkly, “You want to rescue them?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. He once again nodded in front of the earnest focus of the many members from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company.</p>
 <p>“It is possible. You can use the so-called ‘Fire Lotus Bottles’ to exchange for them. One bottle exchanged for one life.” The corner of the mouth of the He clan’s head was lifted into a dark, solemn smile as he slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>“What do you say?” The clan head of the He clan gave a superficial smile when he saw Xiao Yan’s actions.</p>
 <p>“Nothing.” Xiao Yan smiled. The word that he spat out caused the face of the head of the He clan to instantly become dark and cold. Those people from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company also revealed gray faces. The hope in their heart was slowly destroyed.</p>
 <p>“Since that is the case, you should leave. Although the old me knows that you are not an ordinary person, my He clan is also not some nameless group. If you really want to find trouble with my He clan, it is likely that there will not be much benefit to you.” The clan head of the He clan laughed. If he was not partly afraid of the other party’s strength, it was likely that he would have long since forcefully attacked and captured Xiao Yan. After which, he would imprison the latter and force him to refine the powerful ‘Fire Lotus Bottle’ everyday.”</p>
 <p>“Leave Qingshan Town in ten minutes and I can treat it as though nothing has happened.” Xiao Yan ignored the cold laughter of the head of the He clan and slowly spoke at his own pace.</p>
 <p>Not only did the clan head of the He clan coldly laugh when he heard this but those guards of the He clan also laughed out loud. Was this fellow a fool? He actually dared to say such arrogant words in front of a strong Dou Wang.</p>
 <p>“You are the first person who dares to speak to me in this manner in so many years. It is indeed true that the youth should be feared.” The clan head of the He clan slowly withdrew his laughter as he spoke. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed when he saw this. He slowly shook his head. There were so many people in this world who thought that they were great...</p>
 <p>He raised his hand slowly and immediately aimed it that the head of the He clan who had a cold smile on the corner of his mouth. Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and his clothes immediately fluttered in the absence of wind. The surging Dou Qi suddenly erupted out from his body without holding back. At this moment, a tornado seemed to have rose from the training ground. Numerous crack lines with Xiao Yan at the center began to spread out like a spiderweb.</p>
 <p>The current Xiao Yan was already breaking through the peak of the Dou Wang class. The fluctuation of his aura at this moment was the most intense. Hence, when his mood fluctuated, the powerful Dou Qi within his body that was already comparable to an elite Dou Huang broke out of his body!</p>
 <p>The faces of everyone in the entire training ground including the head of the He clan revealed a shock expression the moment the powerful Dou Qi was revealed. This aura… had already far exceeded the Dou Wang class!</p>
 <p>The body belonging to the head of the He clan was shaken by the powerful Dou Qi and forced back for over ten steps before he stabilized his body. At this moment, his face was somewhat pale. The cold smile in his eyes had completely disappeared. He had never imagined that this young man in front of him, who did not look older than twenty years, was actually an expert at the Dou Huang class!</p>
 <p>The throat of the head of the He clan rolled a little as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He quietly let out bitterness within his heart. He did not expect that by simply finding trouble with a small mercenary company, he would actually end up provoking such a terrifying person.</p>
 <p>Ka Gang, Ling Er, and the others were also staring at Xiao Yan, whose clothes was fluttering, in a stunned manner. Despite being some distance apart, the Dou Qi within their bodies had become somewhat dull under that pressure.</p>
 <p>Compared to the shock of the clan head of the He clan, the assault that they had received was undoubtedly a couple of times greater. This was because they clearly understood that this black-robed young man had merely been a Dou Zhe, not even a Dou Shi, just a couple of years ago. However, he had currently… leaped to an extent where he could contend with the top experts within the empire. This kind of training speed… was really inhumane!</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man from the Bloody Battle Mercenary Company also looked at the black-robed man whose robe was fluttering without any wind. A wild joy surged within their hearts a moment later. The Bloody Battle Mercenary Company was saved!</p>
 <p>The Dou Qi within the body of the head of the He clan was flowing wildly and trying its best to resist the pressure that was coming from Xiao Yan. His gaze repeatedly swept over that calm, young face while a storm brewed within his heart. Since when did such a young elite Dou Huang appear within the empire?</p>
 <p>This thought lingered within his heart. At a certain moment, the body of the head of the He clan shook. He suddenly recalled the intense big battle within the empire not long ago that had changed the situation within it. The main character of that big battle was an extremely young, black-robed man…</p>
 <p>The eyes of the head of the He clan shrank when he thought of this. His limbs were icy-cold. Even his tone had turned unusually sharp because of his shock.</p>
 <p>“You are the chief of the Yan Alliance, Xiao Yan?”</p>
 <p>The sharp voice of the head of the He clan undoubtedly appeared like thunder that exploded by the ears of everyone within the training ground, causing their eyes to reveal a dullness...</p>
