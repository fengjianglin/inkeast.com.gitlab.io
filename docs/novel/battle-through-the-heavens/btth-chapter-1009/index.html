 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1009: Hidden Training In the Blood Pool!</u></strong></p>
 <p>The first thing Xiao Yan felt after charging into the Blood Pool was the pure energy with an unbelievable density. Jade-green Dou Qi lingered around his body, completely isolating the blood-colored liquid around him in the process. He did not absorb the energy in this place. Instead, he swam toward the bottom of the Blood Pool after pausing for a moment.</p>
 <p>The red liquid in the Blood Pool was quite viscous. It was just like fresh blood. Visibility had shortened this place. Even when one swam, one would sense quite a strong resistance. Moreover, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to be stunned was that his Spiritual Strength had difficulty penetrating the blood-red liquid. This feeling was just like the strange maze fog that he had met in the forest earlier.</p>
 <p>Although his Spiritual Strength had difficulty penetrating the blood-red-colored liquid, Xiao Yan could still vaguely sense that there was something crazily absorbing the energy within the Blood Pool not far from him. Clearly, that should be Feng Qing Er and the others.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body momentarily stopped. He hesitated for a moment as his gaze looked to the bottom of the Blood Pool. Due to his sight being hindered, all that he could see was a serene dark-red. At a glance, it gave one a feeling that caused one’s pores to stand.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and the dark-golden bone appeared in it. He held it tightly, clenched his teeth, and moved, breaking through the red-colored liquid in the process. After which, he swiftly swam toward the bottom.</p>
 <p>The further Xiao Yan was from the surface of the Blood Pool, the energy that the red-colored liquid contained also became even denser and more pure. However, Xiao Yan clearly understood that this red-colored energy was contaminated with an extremely rich fire poison. This kind of fire poison was not naturally formed with the energy. Instead, it had seeped out of this volcano. This Heaven Mountain Blood Pool should be the middle of the volcano where the fire poison was the most wild and violent.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan had seen something like this fire poison back then in the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower of the Inner Academy. However, these two fire poisons were clearly on two completely different levels. This Heaven Eye Mountain’s volcano had existed for an unknown number of years. The accumulated fire poison was extremely terrifying. Otherwise, it would not be possible for it to injure Jin Shi so much. An elite Dou Zong was not weak.</p>
 <p>A jade-green flame surrounded Xiao Yan’s body. Its frightening temperature caused the blood-red energy around him to completely vaporize. The fire poison that was contained within the red-colored energy was forcefully expelled by the flame, and was unable to even touch Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>After this continuous descent lasted for around ten minutes, the dark-golden skull in Xiao Yan’s hand finally became hot, and a glow seeped out of it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart rejoiced when he saw the reaction of the skull. His swimming speed gradually slowed before his body came to a stop. His gaze was fire hot as he looked below. The space at that spot vaguely contained a distorted feeling. The large amount of red-colored liquid present seemed as though it had met with an invisible barrier, forcing it to separate.</p>
 <p>“Is this the spatial barrier…” A solemness flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he looked at the distorted space. He could vaguely sense the great strength of this thing. If he were to rely on his own strength, it would have been difficult for him to enter it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slowly raised the dark-golden-colored skull in his hand. After which, he gently placed it on the invisible spatial barrier. Immediately, the skull emitted an intense light as circular ripples rose from the spatial barrier. Immediately, a tunnel that could only accommodate a single person appeared in front of Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The solemness on Xiao Yan’s face became more intense upon seeing this tunnel. He returned the skull to his Storage Ring and inhaled a deep breath. The Glazed Lotus Heart Flame surged out and completely wrapped around his body. Only after applying these precautions did Xiao Yan quietly relax. His body moved and he cautiously swam into the tunnel.</p>
 <p>.......</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body had just passed through the tunnel when he suddenly sensed a powerful pressure surging over. His body immediately sank over a dozen meters before stabilizing.</p>
 <p>After stabilizing his body, Xiao Yan began to raise his eyes and look all around him. This area that was sealed by the spatial barrier was not very large. It was definitely less than a hundred feet in size. The viscosity of the blood-red energy in this place had reached a frightening level. Even when he moved his arm, he would sense a resistance that was over ten times stronger than what it was above.</p>
 <p>A kind of dark-grayish glow was mixed with this viscous blood-colored liquid. The glow emitted a faint fishy stench. Each time these grayish-colored glow landed on the jade-green flame around Xiao Yan’s body, they would immediately burst apart. At the same time, the flame would tremble.</p>
 <p>“Is this the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison? Its corrosive strength is actually this frightening. No wonder even an expert like Jin Shi did not dare to remain for long in this place.” Xiao Yan muttered to himself within his heart. His expression was solemn as he looked over the dense, gray-colored light spots.</p>
 <p>Below Xiao Yan was an uneven surface that was filled with potholes. These various-sized potholes repeatedly emitted a grayish smoke. The interior of the smoke was filled with the gray-colored fire poison. Obviously, the bottom of this Blood Pool was a seething volcano.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze carried some surprise as it swept across this area, that had been sealed by a spatial barrier. After which, he sat within the blood-red liquid. The Glazed Lotus Heart Flame surged out of his body in an unceasing manner, isolating him from the corrosive fire poison.</p>
 <p>“If I didn’t possess the ‘Heavenly Flame,’ it is likely that I would not dare to come here even if I knew that this was a precious area.” Xiao Yan sighed while rejoicing. His hands swiftly formed a seal and both his eyes were gradually shut.</p>
 <p>Within a couple of minutes, Xiao Yan had successfully entered his training condition. Immediately, a fierce suction force slowly surged out of his body.</p>
 <p>Following the surging of his suction force, the quiet blood-red-colored liquid was disturbed. Powerful, viscous, red-colored energy unceasingly entered Xiao Yan’s body like a pillar.</p>
 <p>When the blood-red-colored liquid made contact with the surface of Xiao Yan’s jade-green flame, it immediately emitted waves of ‘chi chi’ sounds. The gray-colored light spots within the liquid energy immediately collapsed. The fire poison had difficulty entering Xiao Yan’s body because of the presence of this Glazed Lotus Heart Flame.</p>
 <p>This blood-colored liquid was considered a great tonic only after the removal of the fire poison. However, due to the accumulation over time, these two things seemed to have completely adhered together. If Xiao Yan did not own the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, it would have been impossible for him to separate them in such an easy fashion.</p>
 <p>When the first wave of majestic blood-red liquid entered Xiao Yan’s body, it caused his entire body to tremble. Such a large amount of energy was comparable to three to five days of effort given a normal day. Now, however, it was completely absorbed within an extremely short period of time. No wonder the Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe had spent such a great amount of effort to hide this place. If one could completely expel the fire poison from this place, the strength of the Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe would definitely soar because of it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s mind controlled the majestic energy that poured into his body and navigated it along the Flame Mantra Qi Method route. During the circulation, Xiao Yan could vaguely sense his veins, bones, muscles, and even cells wildly swallowing the enormous amount of energy, that had invaded his body. While they swallowed, they were also swiftly strengthening themselves…</p>
 <p>The viscous blood energy seemed to possess a kind of miraculous effect. The amount of it that could be absorbed was extremely high. Perhaps it was due to the accumulation over the years, but it also possessed a faint lifeforce. During the absorption, Xiao Yan could feel that his body was in an energetic state. This was a very unique feeling.</p>
 <p>If someone else had been here now, the person would have discovered that Xiao Yan’s entire body seemed to have turned a blood-red color. The majestic, viscous energy had already occupied every single inch of his body. Even his skin had turned extremely flexible while soaking in the blood-colored energy.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart felt a great joy because the blood energy possessed such a miraculous effect. If Xiao Yan had some earlier doubts about this place being able to aid him in breaking through the Dou Huang class, he had forgotten them all. According to this speed, he had the confidence that the bottomless pit of energy needed to breakthrough the Dou Huang class would be filled by this place!</p>
 <p>The bottom of the Blood Pool had given Xiao Yan a great amount of energy that would transform him! In this place, he could fearlessly absorb the energy around without worrying about facing a situation where the energy would be exhausted.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Mountain Fire Poison in this place, that other people were most afraid of, did not pose the slightest threat to Xiao Yan… Hence, this treasure ground could be called a tailor made perfect for Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s suction speed might be frightening, but he also knew that even though this was the case, a long amount of time would still be needed if he wished to breakthrough the Dou Huang class. The energy needed to breakthrough the peak of the Dou Huang class was really too vast.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body sat cross-legged at the bottom of the Blood Pool like a corpse. The jade-green flame around his body appeared as though it could never be extinguished as it firmly protected Xiao Yan. The waves of thick blood-red energy around the flame were penetrating through it, without stopping, before they poured into Xiao Yan’s body.</p>
 <p>The quiet bottom of the Blood Pool did not possess any concept of time. Xiao Yan sat there like an old monk. The aura that was spreading from his body was gradually climbing at a slow pace. Although this pace seemed slow, it was crossing the great canyon between the Dou Huang and the Dou Zong class. Xiao Yan’s strength climbed at a snail’s pace. According to this speed, it was only a matter of time before he broke through…</p>
