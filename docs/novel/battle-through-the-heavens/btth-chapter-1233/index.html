 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1233: Ancient Remains</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Ancient remains?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was initially startled when he heard this. Immediately, his eyes turned abruptly towards the Elder who had spoken and hurriedly said, “Is there news of the Soul Baby Fruit?”</p>
 <p>“Where did you obtain this news from?” Feng zun-zhe was also a little stunned as he looked at that Elder. From the looks of this manner of his, it seemed that he was unaware of this matter.</p>
 <p>That Elder smiled and explained, “Pavilion chief Feng, I have been responsible for the matter regarding the ancient remains recently. Base on the information that had been sent back, there are some Magical Beast tribes that had attempted to barge into the ancient remains but end up miserably pulling back. However, from what those who had fled said, that remains possess a kind of mysterious thing that is extremely similar to the appearance of the Soul Baby Fruit. I guess that thing should likely be the Soul Baby Fruit.”</p>
 <p>“The Soul Baby Fruit is indeed something from the ancient times. It is not too surprising for it to appear in the ancient remains…” Feng zun-zhe was a little excited. He rubbed his hands together and said, “Xiao Yan, you are really a lucky star. We have no result despite searching for a year. Yet, such a good news has been delivered to us the moment you have come out…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be happy too early.”</p>
 <p>Yao Lao was not as optimistic as Feng zun-zhe. He voiced his thoughts, “Currently, this ancient remains has attracted quite a number of experts and factions from the continent. Moreover, that place is within the beast region. It is not an easy matter to take out such a treasure from within it. Back then, the last ancient remains had ended up being flooded with blood. No one knew just how many Dou Zongs or Dou Zuns experts had died there…”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe’s expression became a little solemn when he heard this. He had experienced the ancient remains battle back then and naturally knew just how intense and cruel that kind of battle was.</p>
 <p>“Just what is the matter regarding this ancient remains?” Xiao Yan saw the two people frowning in deep thought and could not resist asking.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get down before we talk about it. Quite a number of things had occurred in the Central Plains during this one year that you were unconscious…” Feng zun-zhe’s eyes looked around him. After which, he exchanged glances with Yao Lao. He beckoned his hands towards Xiao Yan and the group rushed down from the tall sky in front of the countless number of eyes before entering the large hall of the Falling Star Pavilion.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>The group separated and took their seats after having entered the large hall. Xiao Yan smiled towards Little Fairy Doctor, who had closely followed behind him. After which, his eyes turned towards Feng zun-zhe. The latter also smiled upon seeing this. After sipping some fragrant tea, he arranged his thoughts before slowly speaking, “The ancient remains, as the name suggest, is naturally the things that had been passed down from the ancient times. Those that could still leave some remains after so many years meant that the owner of the remains was not an ordinary person. From how the remains that had appeared in the beast region looks complete, its owner might be a Dou Sheng class peak expert…”</p>
 <p>A seriousness flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes when he heard this. Dou Sheng, this was basically an existence that was near the peak of this world. Now that they had broken through to the Dou Zun, he could increasingly sense how terrifying this level was. The things left behind by an expert Dou Sheng undoubtedly possessed an allure that could not be resisted.</p>
 <p>“The ancient times is a completely different era from now. There would naturally be many remains left behind during the countless number of years. Some remains might have been buried or disappeared in time. However, there would also be some which would suddenly be revealed like the ancient remains that is discovered this time around…”</p>
 <p>“Each time the ancient remains appears, it would bring about a bloody storm. You should be aware of just how attractive the things that are left behind by an elite Dou Sheng are. It is sufficient to cause one to become crazy over it…” Feng zun-zhe smiled and said, “The Flame Mantra that you practice is something that Yao Chen and I had underwent a bloody battle back then in order to successfully bring out from the remains that had appeared back then…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. He had heard Yao Lao mentioned that the process of obtaining the Flame Mantra was quite difficult.</p>
 <p>“The ancient remains this time around is likely even more troublesome that the last one that we had participated in. This is because it had appeared within the Beast Region. That is the territory of the Magical Beast tribes…”</p>
 <p>“Beast region…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows slightly. He had heard a little of this area. That place was completely the territories of the Magical Beasts tribes. Although there were also humans roaming around there, those Magical Beasts that had formed a tribe usually possessed extremely xenophobic thoughts. This time around, the ancient remains had appeared on their territory. Given their characters, they would definitely be unhappy for the human experts to come and take a share.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed quite troublesome…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently nodded. Those Magical Beast tribes were extremely troublesome to deal with. It was to the point of causing many experts to feel a headache.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, we have dispatched the experts from the Falling Star Pavilion to pay more attention the moment the ancient remains appear. Originally, we did not intend to get involve in this messy business. For us, who had experienced the competition from the last remains, we clearly understand just how cruel it will be. If the Falling Star Pavilion ends up getting involve in it, it will definitely bring about quite a great trouble…” Feng zun-zhe sighed and said. “The current Falling Star Pavilion has basically already been included in the Hall of Soul’s blacklist. We must always be cautious of time. If we end up suffering a serious blow now, they will definitely beat us when we are down and eliminate us in passing.”</p>
 <p>“Now, Yao Chen has yet to recover his strength. Therefore, he is unable to leave. Without the help of this kind of expert, we will be unable to get entangled with the Hall of Soul…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. The Falling Star Pavilion might be one of the four great pavilions in name but there was still too much of a gap between it and the Hall of Soul, an old faction that had existed for an extremely long time.</p>
 <p>“However, they had found the Soul Baby Fruit within that ancient remains… in this way, they had no choice but to get involve in this messy business…”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe changed his tone and spoke in a deep voice. The Soul Baby Fruit was exceptionally important. It was related to whether Yao Chen would be able to regain his peak strength. If they were really able to obtain it, the strength of the Falling Star Pavilion will undoubtedly soar immediately. At that time, with someone like Yao Chen present, even the Hall of Soul will not dare to easily do any random action.</p>
 <p>Therefore, regardless of how great of a risk it was, they must do their best to help Yao Chen recover to his peak!</p>
 <p>“Currently, the Falling Star Pavilion is enemies with the Hall of Soul. This place is the headquarters of the Falling Star Pavilion and it must have experts present. Therefore old Feng is unable to make this trip to the ancient remains…” Xiao Yan’s finger gently knocked onto the surface of the table and said, “As for teacher, this place possess the Great Falling Star Formation. It will be very safe for you to remain here. Hence, as a precaution, you can only remain here.”</p>
 <p>“After counting in this manner, this ancient remains can only be left to me. I will try must best to bring the Soul Baby Fruit back. Moreover, I am also quite interested in this ancient remains.” Xiao Yan laughed softly.</p>
 <p>“It’s too dangerous… you do not understand just how cruel the fight within this kind of ancient remains is. You still need to rescue your father. Nothing must go wrong with you…” Yao Lao shook his head slowly and said.</p>
 <p>“Teacher… even if the current me ends up meeting an expert of the strength of old ghost Zhai Xing, I will also be able to withdraw safely. Relax, I am aware of my limits…” Xiao Yan smiled. He did not wait for Yao Lao to continue speaking before turning his eyes towards Feng zun-zhe and said, “Old Feng, please help me prepare a detailed map of the beast region. Leave the matter of the Soul Baby Fruit to me.”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe glanced at Yao Lao, who was frowning tightly by the side. He immediately nodded gently and said, “Although I am also very worried, you are indeed currently the best person for this. In order to allow Yao Chen to swiftly recover his peak strength, we can only trouble you this time around. I will settle the map for you as soon as possible. Additionally, bring Qing Luan with you when you leave. Her clan is also within the Beast Region. They might be able to provide a little help when the time comes.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smilingly nodded. He did not reject this good intention of Feng zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao widened his mouth when he saw these two people swiftly making a decision. Immediately, he could only sigh helplessly. He looked at Xiao Yan and softly said, “Since you insist, teacher shall also not try to advise you against it. You should be careful along the way. If you end up meeting with any dangerous situation, you should withdraw immediately. Remember, in my heart, recovering my strength is not as important as you. It is not easy to find a disciple like you…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan rubbed his head and laughingly nodded.</p>
 <p>After subsequently confirming their route, Xiao Yan did not hurriedly set off. This matter was related to whether Yao Lao could completely recover his strength. Hence, nothing must go wrong with it. Therefore, the various intelligence must be complete. As the saying went, if one sharpen one’s axe, one would need less effort which chopping wood. If the information was complete, everything would be done extremely smoothly.</p>
 <p>During these few days, Xiao Yan was also given a Falling Star Pavilion Elder title. Currently, Yao Lao was the pavilion chief of the Falling Star Pavilion. Being his disciple, Xiao Yan could naturally also be considered a member of the Falling Star Pavilion.</p>
 <p>Some commotion was also stirred in the Falling Star Pavilion in the face of such a young Elder. However, no one voiced any objections. The earthshaking atmosphere that Xiao Yan had emitted when he broke out from the tower had already allowed everyone to understand that his strength, it was more than sufficient for him to sit on this Elder’s spot.</p>
 <p>After this rest continued for three days or so, the information related to the ancient remains had also been fully gathered by Xiao Yan. He was aware that it was time to begin travelling to the Beast Region…</p>
 <p>When the sun surfaced in the sky on the morning of the third day, the disciples from the Falling Star Pavilion undergoing morning training turned their eyes towards the sky. There were a couple of figures standing in the air there. A breeze blew over the place and the clothes of these people fluttered, causing them to appear to possess an extraordinary demeanor.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, you should remember to be more careful on this trip. Quickly withdraw if you meet with any trouble!”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe looked at the group that was ready to leave and spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His eyes turned towards Yao Chen beside Feng zun-zhe and inhaled a deep breath. After which, he cupped his hands towards Yao Chen and said, “Teacher, take care. This disciple will definitely bring back the Soul Baby Fruit for your elderly self.”</p>
 <p>After uttering these words, Xiao Yan ceased hesitating any longer. He waved his hand and suddenly turned around. After which, his body moved and swiftly rushed towards the exit. In the blink of an eye, the entire group had disappeared from everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Old fellow… you have found quite a good disciple.”</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe slowly commented as he looked in the direction that Xiao Yan had disappeared towards.</p>
 <p>Yao Lao nodded gently before laughing out loud.</p>
 <p>“There is no regret in my life by being able to obtain this disciple. My choice back then was ultimately a correct gamble…”</p>
