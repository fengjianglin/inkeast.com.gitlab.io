 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1297: Intense Fight</u></strong></p>
 <p>Dense bone chilling killing desire spread across the entire place. It was as though the air had solidified at this moment. The originally deathly quiet air above the forest had become just like winter, emitting an icy coldness that chilled one’s heart.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood on the large body of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python. He looked at Yaohua Liangjun four men group in the distance. After which, he glanced at Hua Jin below, who was looking at him with ill intent. Four six star Dou Zuns. The ferocious reputation of the Profound Sky Sect was really not earned in vain.</p>
 <p>“Young master Xiao Yan, what should we do?” Qing Lin frowned slightly and asked because of this sudden situation.</p>
 <p>“What else can we do? The Profound Sky Sect has actually dispatched such a great force. I think that they are intending on capturing me…” Xiao Yan smiled faintly. A bone chilling coldness surged within his dark black eyes as he softly said, “However, with just the four of you, you have really underestimate me quite greatly…”</p>
 <p>“Your tone is indeed quite arrogant. The strength of that fire lotus of yours might be great but if the four of us join hands, we will be able to forcefully resist it. Without that kind of fire lotus attack, what can you be in the eyes of the four of us?” Yaohua Liangjun laughed coldly.</p>
 <p>An arc was slowly lifted on Xiao Yan’s face when he heard this. His hand seal changed before they suddenly stilled. Vast and mighty aura suddenly surged out from within Xiao Yan’s body in all directions like a volcano.</p>
 <p>“What you describe is the case one month ago…”</p>
 <p>Majestic aura spread across the sky. Waves after waves of heat was quietly formed, causing the air of this place to swiftly become dry.</p>
 <p>“Four star Dou Zun?”</p>
 <p>Yaohua Liangjun’s expression changed slightly when he sensed this aura of Xiao Yan. Although he had already obtained word of this from Hua Jin, the shock in his heart was still quite great now that he had seen it with his own eyes. Within a short one month, Xiao Yan’s strength had rose by two stars. This training speed could be described by the word ‘frightening’. It should be known that if an ordinary Dou Zun was to train normally, it was likely that he would need to cultivate a decade or longer in order to obtain such an increase in his strength. Yet, this amount of time had been forcefully shrunk by many times in Xiao Yan’s hands…</p>
 <p>“The Qi Method that this brat practices is a little strange. If we capture him this time around, we can force him to tell me about the Qi Method. If I can obtain such a Qi Method, my achievements in the future will definitely be quite great. Even within the Profound Sky Sect, there will be hardly anyone who can contend against me…” Yaohua Liangjun’s eyes flickered slightly. A greed flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>“A mere four star Dou Zun. You still do not possess the qualification to do as you please in the hands of the four of us.” That gray robed elder, who was leading the group, glanced at Xiao Yan with an indifferent gaze. He appeared a little impatient when he spoke until this point. He waved his sleeve and said, “This is the final time. Are you going to leave with us or shall we beat you half to death and bring you with us?”</p>
 <p>“This skin of mine is a little thick. I shall choose the latter.” Xiao Yan smilingly said.</p>
 <p>“You may.”</p>
 <p>The expression of the gray clothed elder was dark and dense. He nodded slowly before he suddenly stepped forward and spoke in a deep voice, “This brat is extremely cunning. Attack together and capture him first!”</p>
 <p>“Aye!”</p>
 <p>Yaohua Liangjun and the two others nodded when they heard this. The former still had a deep memory of that fire lotus attack of Xiao Yan even until now. If he was alone, he would really not have the guts to attack. With the destructive force of that fire lotus, it was likely that he would lose his life immediately should he be careless.</p>
 <p>“Young master Xiao Yan, I will block one of them. That slut below shall be dealt with by the the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python.” A solemness surfaced on Qing Lin’s face when she saw the other party beginning to act. This time around, the other party had come prepared. Four six star elite Dou Zuns. This kind of lineup was really quite strong. They were few in numbers. Should they be careless, it was likely that they would really end up dying in the most unexpected place today.</p>
 <p>After her voice sounded, a green light flashed within her jade green eyes. Over a dozen figures surfaced in the sky in an orderly manner. Immediately, they rushed towards Hua Jin under Qing Lin’s orders.</p>
 <p>This large group of human figures that had suddenly appeared and rushed over also gave Hua Jin a shock. However, after sensing that the strongest of this group was merely a two star Dou Zun, she finally sighed in relief. She spoke in disdain, “You actually dare to take out some lowly creatures to embarrass yourself?”</p>
 <p>Qing Lin could not be bothered with Hua Jin’s words. After having released all the experts that were sealed in her eyes, her face also became grave. Both of her hands formed numerous seals in a lightning like fashion. Following the change in her seals, a fierce aura from the ancient times also slowly surged out from within her body.</p>
 <p>Upon sensing the ferocious aura that spread from within Qing Lin’s body, Xiao Yan understood that she had already begun to use the spiritual strength of the Ancient Heaven Serpent. Immediately, he waved his hand. Eleven puppets appeared in a flash. Within the blink of an eye, it had formed a formation. Energy was transferred and it swiftly caused the dark gold colour on the Sky Demon Puppet to become increasingly deep.</p>
 <p>With Xiao Yan’s current strength, he should be able to fight against two six star Dou Zun after using the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. Qing Lin was currently only able to restrain one person. However, the other party still possessed three six star Dou Zun. Hence, he could only summon the Sky Demon Puppet and temporarily fight. Although the Sky Demon Puppet could barely be able to fight with a six star Dou Zun with its strength, it should still be able to delay time.</p>
 <p>During the time that Xiao Yan summoned the Sky Demon Puppet, the ferocious aura of Qing Lin by the side also became increasingly rich. Fortunately, both of her eyes still retained their clarity. Clearly, with her current strength, she was already able to begin controlling the Ancient Heaven Serpent’s soul.</p>
 <p>“Young master Xiao Yan, I will attack first!”</p>
 <p>Qing Lin’s body rushed out in a lightning like fashion after her soft cry sounded. That ferociousness that permeated the sky also caused Yaohua Liangjun’s four men group to have a change in expression.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that this little girl is also troublesome to deal with… fourth brother, I’ll leave it to you.” That leading gray robed elder glanced at Qing Lin, who was rushing over, with some surprise before he frowned and said.</p>
 <p>“Aye, no problem.”</p>
 <p>A somewhat skinny old man nodded with a shady face. Immediately, his body moved and he appeared in front of Qing Lin. He did not say anything else as his dark and cold Dou Qi surged out from his palm. After which, it ruthlessly slammed towards Qing Lin.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Qing Lin let out a cold snort when she saw this skinny old man attacking. She did not give in. Green light lingered within her jade green eyes as she directly moved forward to meet him.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, I really want to see whether you can escape from the palm of my Profound Sky Sect today! Remember the name of this elderly self, Shenlou Guizun!”</p>
 <p>The eyes of the gray robed old man were dense and cold. He lead Yaohua Liangjun and the other expert from the Profound Sky Sect and formed a ring shape, surrounding Xiao Yan in the process.</p>
 <p>“Attack!”</p>
 <p>The moment Xiao Yan was surrounded, that so called Shenluo Guizun’s eyes revealed a ferocious expression. A cold cry sounded. Three vast and mighty Dou Qi surged out immediately. The three figures rushed over towards Xiao Yan with lightning like speed. That ferocious attack directly caused the entire space to solidify.</p>
 <p>“Go.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s back shook. That green-red bone wings were extended from it. His body swiftly pulled back. With a flick of his finger, that Sky Demon Puppet transformed into a golden light that blocked one of the expert from the Profound Sky Sect.</p>
 <p>“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. First Change! Second Change! Third Change!”</p>
 <p>The seals formed by Xiao Yan’s hands changed as his body pulled back explosively. The Dou Qi over his body continued to soar in that instant. Within a short moment, it had broken the four star level. A moment later, the strength of his aura was no longer inferior to that of Yaohua Liangjun.</p>
 <p>“The Skyfire Three Mysterious Change of the Burning Flame Valley…”</p>
 <p>Shenluo Guizun frowned when he saw Xiao Yan’s aura soaring. He immediately laughed coldly, “Do not hold back. The Skyfire Three Mysterious Change has a time limit. When the time’s up, he will be unable to escape today!”</p>
 <p>“Understood.”</p>
 <p>Yaohua Liangjun’s expression was dense and cold as he nodded. The foldable fan in his hand emitted a faint unusual glow. His hand was raised before the fan fell. That foldable fan appeared to become extremely sharp blades that tore through the space and cut towards Xiao Yan’s throat.</p>
 <p>Faced with Yaohua Liangjun swift and ferocious attack, Xiao Yan merely tilted his head a little and narrowly dodged that sharp foldable fan. His right hand was clenched into a fist before ruthlessly smashing furiously onto Yaohua Liangjun’s head.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Yaohua Liangjun naturally did not dare to underestimate Xiao Yan’s current strength. After having used the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, Xiao Yan’s strength was not any inferior to him. Adding the might of the Heavenly Flame, there was even a sign of it having surpassed him in a head on battle.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A cautious thought flashed across Yaohua Liangjun’s heart. He flipped his wrist and the foldable fan in his hand was completely opened with a ripping sound. After which, it blocked in front of him and forcefully received this punch by Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The punch landed on the foldable fan. That purple-brown flame that contained a dense whiteness suddenly surged out from Xiao Yan’s palm. After which, it lingered over the foldable fan in a ferocious manner and swiftly spread over Yaohua Liangjun’s body.</p>
 <p>The flame spread and the sleeve of Yaohua Liangjun turned into ashes in an instant. However, his reaction was also quite quick. When the flame spread over, his vast and mighty Dou Qi erupted from within his body and surged explosively towards the flame with the intention of extinguishing all of them.</p>
 <p>However, a strange scene appeared when the Dou Qi touched the flame. One could see that those Dou Qi that came into contact with the flame would turn into substance like ice crystals in an instant. Hence, within a short moment, Yaohua Liangjun’s arm was covered by a thick layer of ice crystal in front of his shocked eyes…</p>
 <p>“What a strange Heavenly Flame!”</p>
 <p>This unexpected change caused Yaohua Liangjun’s expression to change drastically. His body pulled back hurriedly. Compared to a month ago, the Heavenly Flame of Xiao Yan seemed to have become even more powerful and mysterious.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was just about to give chase after having forced back Yaohua Liangjun with one attack when an elderly figure flashed and appeared in front of him. His shady face contained traces of dense coldness. A dark black large hand directly penetrated through the space like a ghost claw, carrying a kind of dangerous feeling as it grabbed towards Xiao Yan’s head with lightning like speed.</p>
 <p>“Try and receive a Nine Hell Hand from this old me!”</p>
