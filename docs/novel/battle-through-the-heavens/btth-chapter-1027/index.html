 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1027: Wind Killing Finger</u></strong></p>
 <p>Following the green-silver change in Feng Qing Er’s eyes, a deep-green Dou Qi storm instantly erupted with her at the center. A vague-silver lightning flashed within the storm while the loud rumbling sound cause one’s heart to tremble.</p>
 <p>The enormous Dou Qi storm was nearly a hundred feet large. Everyone in the stadium was completely stunned when they saw the energy pressure that spread from it. Such a spectacular scene was created by Feng Qing Er by completely relying on the Dou Qi within her body. The Dou Qi within her body was really vast and majestic.</p>
 <p>A wild, violent suction force was emitted from the Dou Qi storm, and the tough sliver wood stadium seemed to have experienced an earthquake under the tearing force of the wild storm. Arm thick cracks were spreading. The entire arena had begun to tremble at this moment.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body seemed to adhere to the arena. His body remained completely still regardless of how the storm sucked. His gaze was firmly locked onto the storm. He could vaguely see a blurry figure within the storm.</p>
 <p>“Wind Lightning Dou Qi…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes involuntarily narrowed as he studied the flickering lightning glow and the dense wind affinity Dou Qi. This Feng Qing Er’s training talent was indeed somewhat frightening to be able to perfectly merge these two completely different Dou Qis.</p>
 <p>The agility of wind and the violent force of lightning. These two different affinities were perfectly merged and the strength that erupted from them was naturally far from what ordinary Dou Qi could compare with. No wonder this Feng Qing Er possessed the special ability to challenge across classes. This was similar to Xiao Yan’s Dou Qi which was mixed with the existence of a ‘Heavenly Flame,’ allowing the Dou Qi’s strength to be incredible. This was also the trump card of Xiao Yan when he fought with opponents whose strength exceeded him.</p>
 <p>The current ‘Flame Mantra’ was Di class low level. However, by relying on the mysteriousness of the Flame Mantra, it was comparable to a Di class middle level Qi Method. In terms of Qi Methods, Xiao Yan did not gain advantage over Feng Qing Er. After all, with the support of the Wind Lightning Pavilion and her outstanding talent, the Qi Method she practiced would likely be a very high level, and was likely to be much better than that of an ordinary Dou Zong.</p>
 <p>In terms of Dou Techniques, both parties possessed their own ultimate moves. If they did not face each other head-on, it was likely difficult to determine the final victor.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan was weighing both parties strengths in his heart, a colorful cloth suddenly shot out like an arrow from the enormous rotating storm. A bright lightning glow adhered to it as it penetrated the storm. It rocketed through the sky as it viciously shot toward Xiao Yan’s location.</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth, that carried a lightning glow, was traveling at an extremely frightening speed. Within a flash, it had appeared in front of Xiao Yan!</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand seal changed because of this colorful cloth that contained a powerful lightning glow. The space in front of him suddenly became distorted!</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth violently smashed through the distorted space. However, it deviated from its original position, and coincidentally flew past Xiao Yan’s shoulder, narrowly missing it. The lightning glow on it had caused the hair on Xiao Yan’s arm to stand on end when the cloth passed by.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>A cold snort was emitted from the storm when the colorful cloth was easily dodged by Xiao Yan. The cloth shook and swiftly turned around like a colorful snake that possessed some intelligence. After which, it shot toward Xiao Yan’s back.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s toes moved after sensing the rushing wind behind him. His body appeared a couple of dozen meters away.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth shook once again and rushed out. It shot after Xiao Yan like maggots in one’s bones!</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth might seem just like an ordinary cloth, but it emitted a vague chill when it cut through the air. It did not appear like a mere cloth. Instead, it was more like an unusual metal. Adding the powerful Dou Qi that it brought with it, the cloth could easily cut through a rock. An ordinary expert Dou Huang would likely end up seeing blood if they made contact with it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s body had just stabilized when a rushing wind was transmitted over again. He frowned as a jade-green flame swiftly surfaced on his arm. Immediately, he reached his hand behind him and violently grabbed.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand accurately grabbed the colorful cloth that shot over. The powerful strength that was contained in it caused Xiao Yan’s body to tremble. However, with the flame surrounding his hand, the powerful Dou Qi was swiftly grilled by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame into nothingness.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan coldly laughed when he grabbed the colorful cloth. The powerful force that it contained caused Xiao Yan’s body to tremble. However, with the flame surrounding it, that powerful Dou Qi was swiftly grilled into nothingness by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame.</p>
 <p>A cold laugh was emitted by Xiao Yan as he grabbed the colorful cloth. Dou Qi surged from his body. He held the colorful cloth and violently pulled!</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The cloth was pulled until it was completely straight, even a vague metallic sound appeared from it. The other side of the cloth, which disappeared into the storm shook with a great force. Even the enormous Dou Qi storm seemed to have shifted some distance because of this.</p>
 <p>The cloth was completely straight as it emitted a crunching sound under the two frightening forces. The veins on Xiao Yan’s hands moved as he continuously maneuvered his Dou Qi. On the other hand, the Dou Qi storm began to rotate even swifter. The pulling force that was emitted from with became even more intense.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>Although the colorful cloth was not an ordinary item, it was unable to endure being pulled in two directions by two elite Dou Zongs. Hence, it did not take long before numerous tiny cracks appeared in the middle of the cloth. After which, a clear sound rang out as the cloth tore apart. Xiao Yan and Feng Qing Er took quite a number of steps back before they finally stabilized their bodies.</p>
 <p>“Colorful Phoenix Domination!”</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth had just been torn apart when a clear cry suddenly sounded. Immediately, one could hear a repeated ‘swoosh swoosh’ sound as numerous colorful clothes continuously shot out of the storm. After which, they swept toward Xiao Yan from all directions.</p>
 <p>A solemness flashed across his eyes as he watched the colorful scene that covered the sky. The heavy ruler in his hand swiftly drew numerous orbits as ruler figures swiftly appeared.</p>
 <p>“Six-Joint Body Flowing Ruler!”</p>
 <p>Clang clang clang clang clang clang!</p>
 <p>The colorful cloths poured down like rain from all directions, immediately striking the ruler shadows, which were over ten feet wide. A clear sound continuously resonated around the stadium.</p>
 <p>The colorful cloth contained an extremely great strength. Although they would be blocked by the dense ruler shadow’s defenses each time, its strength still formed numerous cracks on the silver wood ground Xiao Yan was standing on. Both of Xiao Yan’s feet were repeatedly shaken until they sank into the silver wood.</p>
 <p>Creak creak!</p>
 <p>A countless number of people were stunned as they watched the beautiful scene in the arena. The colorful clothes poured down from the sky like rain, immediately landing on the circular ruler’s shadow defense. They brought about waves of clear sounds as they destroyed the silver wood arena until it became more and more miserable…</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>Another colorful cloth violently smashed into the ruler shadow’s defenses. The enormous strength in it caused the circular ruler shadow’s defenses along with Xiao Yan to be smashed heavily into the ground. Looking from the outside, one could only see a ten-foot-wide pit.</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was forced into the ground, Feng Qing Er did not stop attacking. She clearly understood that despite the earlier attack appearing like a violent storm, it did not cause Xiao Yan much harm. The continuous ruler shadow’s defenses destroyed over half of the cloths’ strength.</p>
 <p>“Screech!”</p>
 <p>A vast, mighty Dou Qi fluctuation was emitted from the rotating storm. Immediately, the countless number of colorful cloths, that permeated the sky, suddenly entangled together. Within an instant, it formed a hundred-foot-large colorful phoenix in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The colorful phoenix was completely created from cloth. However, the enormous Dou Qi storm suddenly crumbled the moment it was formed. The storm transformed into a ten-foot-large Dou Qi pillar that shot into the body of the enormous, colorful phoenix.</p>
 <p>“Wind Lightning Sacrifice!”</p>
 <p>The disintegration of the Dou Qi storm revealed Feng Qing Er’s within it. Her finger pointed at the colorful phoenix in the distance, and a drop of fresh blood flew from the finger. Finally, it landed on the body of the colorful phoenix.</p>
 <p>A life force formed in the colorful phoenix as the drop of fresh blood landed on its body, much to the disbelief of others. The majestic aura that was contained within it also became more wild and violent.</p>
 <p>“Wind Killing Finger!”</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er’s body was suspended in the sky. Her colorful dress fluttered, causing her to appear as noble and haughty as a female deity. Her finger was pointed at the ten-foot-wide pit below as she let out a cold cry!</p>
 <p>The colorful phoenix immediately emitted a loud, clear screech when its cry sounded. A majestic, frightening, green-silver light pillar formed in the mouth of the colorful phoenix. It swiftly shrank an instant later, transforming into a light that was only the size of a palm as it shot out with a ‘swoosh’ sound.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, one finger shall take your life!”</p>
 <p>Feng Qing Er’s bone chilling voice resounded over the sky while the ray of light shot out, causing the expressions of some people to change.</p>
 <p>“Wind Killing Finger, one of the deadliest Dou Techniques within the Wind Lightning Pavilion…”</p>
 <p>The sound of air being inhaled repeatedly materialized across the stadium when Feng Qing Er’s voice appeared. Clearly, everyone was familiar with this beautiful finger.</p>
 <p>Feng zun-zhe, who had already returned to his seat some time ago, narrowed both of his eyes at this moment. His body leaned forward. A deep-green rotating wind was lingering over his finger like a spirit. However, a lightning vaguely flickered over the hand of Lei zun-zhe by the side when Feng zun-zhe’s Dou Qi fluctuated. Clearly, if Feng zun-zhe were to attack at this moment, it was likely that he would stop him immediately…</p>
 <p>The speed of the light was extremely frightening. It seemed to have penetrated through space. In a flash, it had appeared in the air above the pit in front of a countless number of gazes. The next instant, the endless shadow defense collapsed!</p>
 <p>Numerous regretful sighs immediately sounded from around the arena when they saw the ruler’s shadow defense collapse.</p>
 <p>However, their sighs had just sounded when a exquisite jade-green fire lotus quietly surfaced from the ruler shadow. Its petals parted, causing it to appear exceptionally beautiful…</p>
