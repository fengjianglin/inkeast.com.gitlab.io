 <p><strong><u>Chapter 927: Refining the Fierce Spirit</u></strong></p>
 <p>When Xiao Yan woke from his unconscious state, his eyes landed on a pair of lovely grayish purple-coloured eyes. He only sighed in relief when he saw the clearness within them. He pulled his body up. He suddenly discovered that he had unknowingly laid down on the Little Fairy Doctor’s bed and was able to sniff the special fragrance unique to a young female. Xiao Yan mind descended into his body and swept through it, only to discover that the poison gas had already completely vanished.</p>
 <p>“I already helped you remove the poison vapor. There is no need for you to worry.” The Little Fairy Doctor beside the bed used her hands to support her head as she watched him without moving. She involuntarily broke into a smile and spoke when she saw what Xiao Yan was doing, causing him to feel as though everything in front of him had brightened.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. His gaze swept over the Little Fairy Doctor’s body as he said in surprise, “Your strength…” From his senses, the aura of the Little Fairy Doctor in front of him seemed to be much denser than before.</p>
 <p>“The eruption of the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ released a lot of poison gas. Such poison gas might be harmful to all of you, but it is the greatest tonic to me. After absorbing all of it, my strength has also advanced a little.” The Little Fairy Doctor softly explained.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only came to a sudden understanding after hearing her explanation. He immediately smacked his mouth and exclaimed, “It is indeed worthy of being the ‘Woeful Poison Body.’ Such a method to raise one’s strength is really something I have never heard of.”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor warmly smiled. Her pretty eyes watched Xiao Yan, and her face immediately turned red again. Her originally snow-white skin appeared exceptionally white against the pink background. It was just like the white-snow in the north. Her mercury-like watery eyes seemed to hid some other emotion. She lowered her head and softly said, “It’s all thanks to you this time around. If you had not been here, I’m afraid that I would have walked my last step.”</p>
 <p>“Why are you saying all this? If I wasn’t here, you would not have undone the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ seal so many times, and the eruption would not have been brought forward.” Xiao Yan shook his head as he rolled down from the bed. He clapped his hand, observed the Little Fairy Doctor with his eyes, and said, “The seal should have already been completed right?”</p>
 <p>A bright-redness involuntarily surfaced on the Little Fairy Doctor’s face upon the mention of the seal. She gently inclined her somewhat skinny snow-white chin and said, “Yeah, I can sense that the ‘Woeful Poison Body’ has already been suppressed. According to the strength of the seal, it should not be a problem maintaining it for two to three years.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded and smiled as he said, “That’s good. Two to three years is sufficient for us to find the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor nodded.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Let’s leave this place first. I think that First Elder and the others should be anxious from waiting…” Xiao Yan waved his hand and walked to the door. The Little Fairy Doctor obediently followed from behind.</p>
 <p>Su Qian was pacing back and forth uneasily outside of the room. It had already been half a day since Xiao Yan had entered, but there was still not even the slightest activity. Due to him being afraid of the poison gas inside, he did not dare to randomly barge in.</p>
 <p>However, the tightly shut door was slowly opened just when Su Qian’s face was filled with anxiety. A creaking sound caused his gaze to shoot over at the first moment. Only when he saw a black-robed, young man walking out of the room did he sigh in relief and appear as though he had been relieved of a great burden.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Su Qian swiftly stepped forward. He sighed in relief when he saw that the two individuals were fine. However, his voice was somewhat worried as he asked.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He raised his head and looked at the drifting grayish gas within the light curtain. The poison gas in this place might not be as dense as the fog within the house, but it would likely cause quite a great harm to the students if it was allowed to spread.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor by the side seemed to be aware of Xiao Yan’s thoughts. Her hand was extended gently before it beckoned. A hurricane appeared within the light curtain from nowhere, sucking all the poison gas together before it transformed into a dense vapor pillar that was absorbed into the Little Fairy Doctor’s body.</p>
 <p>Su Qian involuntarily clicked his tongue in surprise as he watched the Little Fairy Doctor subdue this poison vapor by merely raising her hand. His gaze swept over her and an astonishment flashed through his eyes. He involuntarily cried out, “You have advanced?”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor nodded slightly as she watched Su Qian’s astonished manner. She knew the reason for him to lose himself. After all, each star of advancement for an elite Dou Zong would mean a great increase in one’s strength. An ordinary Dou Zong might have difficulty raising their strength by even a star even after a couple of years or even a full decade.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, I am indeed old. This world still belongs to the young…” Su Qian sighed and shook his head. His tone was filled with envy.</p>
 <p>“First Elder, please distribute this medicinal powder to those students who accidentally inhaled the poison gas. They should be fine after resting for a couple of days.” The Little Fairy Doctor took out a jade bottle from her Storage Ring and handed it to Su Qian while speaking somewhat apologetically.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, it’s alright. Just treat it as giving those little brats a little lesson. Otherwise, they would just rush forward if they see anything they are curious about in the future.” Su Qian received the jade bottle and laughed heartily.</p>
 <p>“First Elder, since everything is fine, why don’t you remove the energy barrier first.” Xiao Yan raised his head, looked at the energy barrier above, and smiled as he gave a suggestion.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I think that your second brother should be extremely anxious from waiting outside.” Su Qian smiled. He waved his sleeves and an invisible ripple was emitted. Immediately, the energy light barrier that covered the courtyard shook slightly and gradually scattered.</p>
 <p>The energy light barrier had just scattered when a couple of human figures hurriedly barged in. They only sighed in relief upon seeing that Xiao Yan and the other two were standing unharmed in the courtyard.</p>
 <p>The people who had barged in were naturally Xiao Li, Zi Yan, and the others. The one who caused Xiao Yan to be a little surprised was a blue-clothed lady, Xin Lan from ‘Pan’s Gate.’</p>
 <p>Xin Lan’s hand patted her voluminous chest upon seeing Xiao Yan. She said, “Big brother Xiao Yan, you are the helper that I have gained after much difficulty. Nothing must happen to you…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. He chatted with Xiao Li initially before turning his gaze to Xin Lan. He said, “Relax, I will naturally not go back on my promise to you. That’s right, when are you going to begin the journey to the Central Plains?”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan mused for a moment and said, “Two months from now; I am currently refining a kind of medicinal pill which requires a little time.”</p>
 <p>“Two months huh…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan fondled his chin. Tian Huo zun-zhe still needed to refine the fierce spirit. Moreover, he had planned to try to refine the so-called ‘Sky Demon Puppet’ before he left. Of course, the most important thing was that he had to refine the ‘Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill’ that he had promised Medusa before he left. After all, no one knew just how long he would need after he left. If there was really a situation on Medusa’s side… it was likely that she would not be able to wait for such a long time.</p>
 <p>Moreover, given her character, the failure of Xiao Yan to keep his promise and hand over the medicinal pill might likely result in her furiously hating him for the rest of her life. Therefore, he definitely could not delay this matter. Although it was somewhat difficult for Xiao Yan to refine a tier 7 medicinal pill with his current ability, he had to at least give it a try regardless of what happened. Looking at things this way, it seemed that two months was going to be really short.</p>
 <p>“We won’t be late for the ‘Pill Gathering’ of the Pill Tower, will we?” Xiao Yan sighed softly in his heart before he appeared to have suddenly recalled something and quickly inquired. This was also something that he attached great importance to. Nothing must go wrong.</p>
 <p>“Relax, there is still over two years time until this season’s ‘Pill Gathering.’ You will have sufficient preparation time when you arrive at the Central Plains.” Xin Lan smiled as she replied.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief in his heart when he heard that there was that much time remaining. He did not wish to rush to the Central Plains at great speed just to participate in the large scale ‘Pill Gathering’ where all sorts of people gathered without familiarizing himself with the area. Colliding around blindly would not benefit him.</p>
 <p>“Since you are fine, I will rest assured. I still need to return to blend some medicinal ingredients. You are also a busy person. Let’s meet two months later…” Xin Lan did not stay any longer after seeing that Xiao Yan was fine. She gave him a saucy smile before turning around to leave the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan exhaled gently as he watched Xin Lan’s disappearing back. It seemed that he needed to make full use of these two months…</p>
 <p>On the second day after Xiao Yan had settled the Little Fairy Doctor’s matter, he once again entered the magma world under the ‘Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.’ He needed to help Tian Huo zun-zhe refine the fierce spirit, and he was going to attempt to refine a ‘Sky Demon Puppet.’</p>
 <p>Despite a period of time having passed, the magma world was still dead quiet. It was difficult to imagine that this quiet world hid a strange race as well as a secret that could stir the entire Dou Qi continent…</p>
 <p>When Xiao Yan had once again appeared in the cave he had created, Tian Huo zun-zhe also leaped out. At this moment, his figure was quite blurry. Despite having been woken from his slumber with the ‘Soul Cultivating Saliva’ that Xiao Yan had used, his spiritual condition was far inferior when compared to the past.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, given my current condition, it will be difficult for me to completely suppress the fierce spirit. Hence, you will also need to lend me a hand.” When Tian Huo zun-zhe appeared, he spoke with a solemn expression.</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, please rest assured that Xiao Yan will do all he can.” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together as he replied in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe nodded. He slowly said, “Additionally, please lend me the ‘Fallen Heart Flame!’ I need to borrow its strength in order to refine the fierce spirit!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not hesitate upon hearing this. He beckoned with his hand and a cluster of invisible flame appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Xiao Yan had taken out the Fallen Heart Flame without any hesitation, Tian Huo zun-zhe deeply studied him. He smiled as he said, “Little fellow, you really suit the old me’s tastes. The old me will remember all of the favors that you have given.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled, but did not refute his words. After having been in contact for a period of time, he also knew that Tian Huo zun-zhe seemed to value things like favors very greatly.</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, please begin!”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe nodded heavily. His face was filled with a solemn expression. He extended his hand and beckoned with it. After which, the Fallen Heart Flame slowly floated in front of him. He flicked his finger and the white-colored ring on Xiao Yan’s finger abruptly trembled. Immediately an unusually violent and fierce aura erupted from it!</p>
