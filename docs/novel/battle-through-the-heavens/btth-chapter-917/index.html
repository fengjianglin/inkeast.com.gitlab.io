 <p><strong><u>Chapter 917: Kill</u></strong></p>
 <p>The glaring light suddenly disappeared. Protector Xuan’s frightened and furious roar sounded at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, return the fierce spirit to this protector! Otherwise, I will definitely let you die an extremely miserable!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan completely ignored Protector Xuan’s furious roar. The fierce spirit had been connected to Protector Xuan’s spirit. Now that the fierce spirit had been captured, he would suffer an intense backlash. With his Spiritual Strength suffering a great blow, his strength would definitely decline. The current him already posed no problem and was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xiao Yan’s eyes were surprised as he stared at the white-colored ring on his hand. He could faintly see a bright-redness on the ring’s surface. However, Xiao Yan was unable to probe the ring to see the situation within it probably because of the ring itself or Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan, the fierce spirit has temporarily been sealed by me. However, the Spiritual Strength that I have stored is basically completely exhausted. The exhaustion this time around is too great and I will soon descend into a slumber. You must definitely remember to help me repair and moisten my spirit within ten days. Otherwise, my spirit will likely be completely scattered… at that time, the fierce spirit I have sealed will likely appear once again.” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s voice suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan’s heart while Xiao Yan was feeling surprise. This time around, his voice contained a kind of weakness that was difficult to hide. Despite subduing the fierce spirit, the exhaustion he felt was immense.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He hurriedly asked in his heart, “Within ten days? Old mister Yao, this is not a joke. Some of the medicinal ingredients required to repair a spirit are extremely difficult to find. Where would I go and find them within ten days?”</p>
 <p>“I am not asking you to completely heal my spirit within ten days. It is fine as long as you are able to get something to nourish my spirit and wake me up from my slumber.” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s voice immediately sounded in reply. Moreover, it was even more anxious. It seemed that he had little remaining time left.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief when he heard these words. It was not difficult to randomly get something to nourish one’s spirit. He should be able to do that within ten days…</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, please rest assured that the little me will definitely summon you from your slumber within ten days.” Xiao Yan spoke in a solemn voice. Although he could not trust Tian Huo zun-zhe completely like he trusted Yao Lao, Tian Huo zun-zhe’s presence would really benefit Xiao Yan. Regardless of whether it was in terms of experience or training, these extremely old demons would be able to provide him with a lot of help.</p>
 <p>“He he, the old me can rest assured with these words of yours. I’ll leave it to you. This matter is extremely important…” Tian Huo zun-zhe relaxed only after hearing Xiao Yan’s reply. He and Xiao Yan might have only been acquainted for a short period of time, but his old, sharp eyes were able to tell a little about Xiao Yan’s character. It was due to this that he dared to hand this life of his to Xiao Yan at such a time. Although this was partly due to the situation forcing his hand, it also required him to trust Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>The words of Tian Huo zun-zhe became weaker. When the final word landed, his voice had completely scattered. Xiao Yan could vaguely sense the spirit within the white-colored ring become dim…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan tightened his fist and gently exhaled a breath of air. He withdrew his hand that contained the ring into his sleeves before slowly lifting his head to study the crazy-looking Protector Xuan with a cold smile. This intervention by Tian Huo zun-zhe had basically given the latter a fatal blow. Not only was the fierce spirit captured, but Protector Xuan’s spirit was also severely damaged. Even if he could leave this place alive this time around, his future strength would likely drop to the Dou Huang class… this was a feeling even worse than death for Protector Xuan.</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan’s illusionary black figure stood somewhat unsteadily in the sky. His eyes were viciously glaring at Xiao Yan. Coarse breaths were repeatedly emitted from his mouth. A painful feeling occasionally appeared on his face. The waves of piercing pain that had been transmitted from his spirit caused him, someone who had suffered serious losses, to possess a nearly crazy impulse.</p>
 <p>“Return the fierce spirit to me. I can use my spirit to swear that I will leave immediately. If you are willing, I can even help you kill Han Feng” Protector Xuan’s hand covered his forehead and softly roared.</p>
 <p>Han Feng’s expression a short distance away also turned cold when he heard Protector Xuan’s words. A killing intent flashed across his eyes. It was unexpected that this Protector Xuan would actually be this unreliable.</p>
 <p>“Protector Xuan, it is useless saying all this now. With Xiao Yan’s character, he will definitely not return the fierce spirit to you. Hence, you might still stand a chance if you really risk your life and go all out against him.” Han Feng glanced at Xiao Yan before speaking in a cold voice.</p>
 <p>“Shut up!”</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan’s eyes turned cold as he furiously yelled at Han Feng. From the way he saw it, had Han Feng not used so many reasons to attract him here, he would not have come to the ‘Black-Corner Region’ and got involved in this mess. In the end, he gained nothing, and had gotten into a mess. Moreover, whether or not he had the life to leave was altogether another manner. The anger in his heart was somewhat pushed onto Han Feng.</p>
 <p>Han Feng also let out a cold smile after being reprimanded by Protector Xuan. He did not continue to argue with him. All that had occurred was a killing intent in his heart. It was likely that he would quietly murder Protector Xuan even if he did not die in this place today...</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan’s mouth was panting as his blood-red eyes turned toward Xiao Yan with a ‘shua’ sound. A wildness had gradually surged into his eyes because of the intense pain that was transmitted from his spirit. His tone was dense as he asked, “Are you going to return it or not?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan kept his indifferent manner in the face of Protector Xuan’s crazy eyes. He glanced at Han Feng and half-smiled as he said, “If you really kill Han Feng, I might give it some thought…”</p>
 <p>“I will act immediately if you return the fierce spirit to me!” Protector Xuan could not be bothered with other things. He hurriedly made another demand when he heard the suspiciousness from Xiao Yan’s tone being reduced. However, he did not sense the a gaze on his back full of killing intent.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes smiled as they looked at Protector Xuan. The ridicule in his eyes was becoming denser.</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan finally understood that he had been tricked after having sensed the mocking gaze of Xiao Yan… the panting from his mouth grew more intense. The viciousness in his eyes also became denser. A moment later, a wild roar was finally emitted from his mouth, “Ten Spirit Envoys, kill him!”</p>
 <p>The ten black figures on the mountain wall did not hesitate. They suddenly rushed forth after hearing Protector Xuan’s roar. Immediately, ten enormous dark-black chains tore through the air like poison snakes. They shot toward Xiao Yan while emitting a clanging sound.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan widened his mouth as he looked at the chains being shot over indifferently. He widened his mouth and a cluster of jade-green flames was spat out. His hand moved and formed a seal. The flame wiggled and turned into ten large flame hands. They were violently clenched as they grabbed the chains. After which, a thread of hot jade-green fire followed the chains and rushed toward the ten black figures.</p>
 <p>“Chi chi!”</p>
 <p>The flame climbed the chains and immediately emitted waves of ‘chi chi’ sounds. The black fog around the ten black figures also became much fainter. A pair of somewhat shocked and furious eyes was revealed within each black fog.</p>
 <p>Waves of cold black fog repeatedly surged out of the bodies of these black figures. After which, they tried their best to prevent the spreading of the fire. However, these Spirit Envoys’ strengths were clearly far inferior to Protector Xuan’s. Hence, they did not manage to extinguish even a little of the strange fire after struggling for quite awhile. Having no other choice, they could only hurriedly abandon the chains.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan let out a cold laugh the moment the chains left their hands. He clenched his fist and the ten flame hands immediately transformed into raging flames that completely wrapped around the chains. In an instant, the dark-black chain had transformed into flame chains.</p>
 <p>Under Xiao Yan’s control, the flame chains appeared like ten long rods. They transformed into a fire glow that suddenly shot back along their original path with the flick of a finger.</p>
 <p>Chi! Chi! Chi!</p>
 <p>The speed of the flame chains was extremely quick. Within the blink of an eye, it launched past the distant air and appeared in front of the ten Spirit Envoys. In their shock, the ten black figures hurriedly retreated. However, their speed was on a completely different level when compared to the flame chains. Hence, the figures had just moved when the flame chains arrived. After which… they were like sharp swords as they violently penetrated their chests!</p>
 <p>The ten figures immediately stiffened following the penetration of the fire chains. The chains also slowly became softer. Finally, they abruptly fell from the sky. The jade-green flame on them swiftly left and returned to Xiao Yan’s body in front of everyone’s eyes…</p>
 <p>Within a short couple of exchanges, the ten Spirit Envoys, whose strength were at the Dou Wang class, were killed by Xiao Yan’s hands. This scene caused quite a number of people present to quietly swallow a mouthful of saliva. A combination of ten expert Dou Wangs would be able to fight a little even if they were facing an expert Dou Huang. It was unexpected that they were so worthless in Xiao Yan’s hands.</p>
 <p>The glow in Xiao Yan’s eyes gradually soared after killing the ten Spirit Envoys. The bone wings on his back were flapped and a wind-lightning sound appeared. His body then appeared in front of Protector Xuan in a ghost-like manner.</p>
 <p>“Since you have come, there is no longer a need for you to leave. The people from the ‘Hall of Souls’... all deserve to die!”</p>
 <p>A savage arc was lifted on Xiao Yan’s face as his palm abruptly struck out, and a jade-green flame spat out like a volcano!</p>
 <p>This swift attack by Xiao Yan also caused Protector Xuan’s expression to change drastically. His body swiftly withdrew, but with his seriously wounded condition, his strength was already far inferior to what it was before. Hence, a thread of flame caught up to him even though he had dodged quickly. The hot temperature caused him to emit a miserable screech.</p>
 <p>The black fog around Protector Xuan’s body was swiftly reduced while the flame burned. The flame had dispersed by the time Protector Xuan had withdrawn by a hundred meters. He was incomparably miserable at this moment…</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan was panting as he stopped his body. The eyes he shot at Xiao Yan could no longer be described as vicious. Just when he was about to turn into a violent range, a human figure suddenly appeared beside him. His gaze swept across it and he immediately cried out furiously, “Han Feng, join hands with me and kill this little…”</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>Protector Xuan’s words had yet to reach the end when he suddenly stiffened. He slowly lowered his head with much difficulty only to see a hand that was wrapped in Dou Qi penetrating his chest…</p>
 <p>“The current you is merely trash even if you managed to survive. Coincidentally, those Spirit Envoys had all been killed off by Xiao Yan. No one will report to the ‘Hall of Souls.’ Hence, you should give your soul to me. I will help you take revenge…</p>
 <p>Han Feng slowly withdrew his hand. He looked at the swiftly disappearing life force within Protector Xuan’s eyes. A cruel smile was lifted on his face as he muttered to himself.</p>
