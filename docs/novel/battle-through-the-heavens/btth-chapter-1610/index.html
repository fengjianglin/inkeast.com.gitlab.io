 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1610: Withdraw</u></strong></p>
 <p>Warm sunlight came pouring down from the sky like a waterfall. Under the warm sunlight, the deathly aura that permeated the place had also quickly disappeared…</p>
 <p>Lei Ying and the rest finally sighed in relief after the surrounding deathly aura had completely vanished. They lifted their eyes and looked around. Currently, they were still in the Burial Mountain Range. However, no life had remained in the current mountain range. Clearly, all life had been eroded by the deathly aura from earlier.</p>
 <p>A black mass of experts from the Hun clan stood in the sky a short distance from the alliance. Their eyes revealed a ferocious glow as they stared at the alliance army. However, the expressions of some of the upper echelons amongst them were quite ugly. Clearly, they did not expect that this so called ultimate killing formation was actually unable to cause much harm to the alliance army.</p>
 <p>“What happened? Why has the Death World been destroyed with such ease?” The expression of the Nihility Devouring Flame quickly became gloomy. He looked at Hun Yuantian’s group and demanded furiously.</p>
 <p>Hun Yuantian’s group could only smile bitterly in the face of the anger of the Nihility Devouring Flame. The grayish dark faced elder hesitated for a moment before replying honestly, “Hun Yuantian’s Deathly Silence Gate had been snatched by Xiao Yan. Currently, the formation isn’t complete. Moreover, that Xiao Yan had used the strength of the Deathly Silence Gate to protect the alliance army. The alliance army subsequently combined their attacks and forcefully break the area guarded by Hun Yuantian…”</p>
 <p>“Bastard. Such an important thing has actually been stolen? What is the point of keeping you around!” A fierce glint immediately flashed across the Nihility Devouring Flame’s eyes when he heard this. His eyes were dense as he stared at Hun Yuantian. After which, he slammed his hand violently and the space crumbled. A black flame palm landed on Hun Yuantian’s body with lightning like speed, causing the already injured Hun Yuantian to have a weary aura. He clenched his teeth and could only quietly accept the attack. The position of the Nihility Devouring Flame in the Hun clan was basically comparable to Hun Tiandi. Without his existence, it would have been impossible for the Hun clan to last until now.</p>
 <p>“Nihility sir, it is pointless to be angry now. The alliance army has not suffered much of a loss. On the other hand, we have exhausted the life force within our bodies. It is impossible for us to use the formation again.” The grayish dark faced elder could only sigh after seeing this scene. Finally, he opened his mouth and pursued. Although Hun Yuantian had committed an extremely foolish mistake, he was also a veteran of the Hun clan. Killing him at this moment would be a big loss to the Hun clan.</p>
 <p>The Nihility Devouring Flame had a dark and gloomy expression. He glanced at the alliance army in the distance. Although the alliance had suffered some losses in the Death World, it was clearly not extremely serious. Their fighting strength was still extremely strong.</p>
 <p>“Let’s withdraw for today. Nihility, do it…”</p>
 <p>An icy cold voice suddenly resounded beside the ears of the experts from the Hun clan while the latter were quiet. Their bodies ended up shuddering. This voice belonged to Hun Tiandi.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>The Nihility Devouring Flame snorted coldly upon hearing this. He once again glared ruthlessly at the pale looking Hun Yuantian. However, he did not disobey Hun Tiandi’s orders. He inhaled a deep breath of air and his body suddenly began to swell wildly. A torrent of black flames surged out from within his body in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it had already swept throughout the entire world. The lush green forest of the Burial Mountain Range below had been turned into ashes in an instant. Even the mountain rocks were turned into dust.</p>
 <p>The caution of the alliance army surged after seeing this action of the Nihility Devouring Flame. Xiao Yan’s expression was grave as he rose into the air. Little Yi appeared ferocious as it stood on his shoulder. The Pink Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame spread over the sky and turned into a huge fire curtain, which surrounded the alliance army. With Xiao Yan’s current Spiritual Strength, he was able to easily unleashed the strength of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to its fullest extent.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>The Nihility Devouring Flame’s icy cold eyes looked at Xiao Yan. A low beast like roar was emitted from his throat. Immediately, his body, which had swelled to a thousand feet suddenly exploded.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The sudden explosion caused the entire place to shake violently. Black flames covered the sky. The black flame seemed to have began to gather at an extremely frightening speed at the spot where the Nihility Devouring Flame had exploded. Within a short moment, a swiftly rotating black flame hole had appeared in the sky at that spot.</p>
 <p>The many experts from the Hun clan seemed to have received an order when they saw the black hole being formed. All of them rushed forward without a word being spoken. After which, they shot into the black hole.</p>
 <p>“They are about to flee!”</p>
 <p>The expressions of Lei Ying and the others changed upon seeing this scene. Many experts quickly rose into the air. Powerful Dou Qi shot out one after another without a need for any orders. Finally, they smashed towards the black hole from all directions.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Faced with the sudden fierce attack from the many experts of the alliance army, a cold snort was suddenly emitted from the Nihility Devouring Flame within the black hole. Immediately, black flame erupted like a volcano, surging out and colliding directly with the many attacks. After which, a devouring power erupted and wildly swallowed the many attacks.</p>
 <p>“Trying to leave? It won’t be so easy!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan clearly found his target. He laughed coldly as the seals formed by his hands changed. A ten thousand feet body slowly appeared. The Yellow Spring Divine Anger that was unleashed by his Di State soul had a strength that was even more terrifying that his Extermination Fire Lotus. This was an extremely pressurising attack against those experts, whose Spiritual Strength was inferior to him. The damage of one’s soul was not something that one could recover from simply resting.</p>
 <p>“Mou!”</p>
 <p>The moment the figure appeared, an earthshaking spiritual attack shot out at a shocking speed. Even the devouring power of the black flames had been forcefully shattered under this spiritual assault. The spiritual attack ruthlessly smashed onto the black hole. Immediately, the bodies of at least a hundred experts from the Hun clan exploded and turned into a bloody fog, which scattered within the black hole.</p>
 <p>The black hole also began to shake violently in the face of this head on spiritual attack. There was a deep moan being vaguely emitted. Clearly, the Nihility Devouring Flame was unable to endure such an attack.</p>
 <p>“Attack together!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan cried in a deep voice. He frowned after seeing that the Yellow Spring Divine Anger was unable to destroy the black hole despite having some effect on it.</p>
 <p>With Gu Yuan being held back, the entire alliance army did not object to some of Xiao Yan’s orders. Even Lei Ying and the others had quietly nodded after sensing just how frightening Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Strength was. Looking from just the point of fighting strength, Xiao Yan was already comparable with them.</p>
 <p>Hence, a large group of experts quickly rose into the sky after hearing Xiao Yan’s cry. Various different Dou Skills were used at this moment. After which, the entire place shook under the vast and mighty attack. The densely packed attacks caused even someone with the strength of the Nihility Devouring Flame to feel his skin turning numb...</p>
 <p>Buzz buzz!</p>
 <p>Some hurried buzzing sound was emitted from within the black hole in the face of such a terrifying lineup. Soon after, one could see an endless number of black light erupting from it. Finally, a black ray of light that covered the sky collided violently with the attack of the alliance army. Immediately, an indescribable frightening energy spread wildly across the sky. The entire mountain range was cut into two by the waves. A hundred thousand feet large deep gully stretched from the mountain range into the horizon.</p>
 <p>“Hold them back! We must not allow them to leave with the ancient jade!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lifted his head. His eyes shot towards the brilliant fireworks in the sky as he cried out loud.</p>
 <p>“Nine Lightning Calamity Palm!”</p>
 <p>“Burning Flame Blazing Sky!”</p>
 <p>“YellowSpring Divine Anger!”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>The entire alliance army’s truly strong individuals had unleashed their strongest attacks at this moment. Immediately, the appearance of the sky was altered. Those observers in the distance felt their hearts trembled from fear. Some of the weaker individuals directly fell onto the ground. This was the first time that they had witnessed an attack of such strength…</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Faced with such a terrifying attack, an irritated curse was also emitted from the Nihility Devouring Flame within the black hole. He was unable to withstand such a strike…</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The frightening attack had arrived almost instantly. However, the attacks were about to strike onto the black hole when a tall figure suddenly appeared in a flash. His expression was dark and solemn while his hands suddenly tore at the space in front of him. A hundred thousand feet large spatial crack erupted and swallowed all the powerful attacks from Xiao Yan’s group…</p>
 <p>“Hun Tiandi!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression sunk after he saw the figure which had intervened.</p>
 <p>The space beside Xiao Yan fluctuated after Hun Tiandi appeared. Gu Yuan surfaced from it. At this moment, the latter’s long hair was in a mess. An aura, which caused even Xiao Yan to be terrified, quietly spread, causing the surrounding space to continue breaking and mending…</p>
 <p>“What a great Xiao Yan!”</p>
 <p>Hun Tiandi originally calm face was covered with a dark and cold murderous intent at this moment. He naturally understood that Xiao Yan’s act of stealing the Deathly Silence Gate had completely spoilt the Hun clan’s plans of severely damaging the alliance army in this place…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were also dark and solemn as he stared at Hun Tiandi. He did not hide the murderous desire in his eyes. He also wanted to kill Hun Tiandi.</p>
 <p>“Gu Yuan, consider yourselves lucky this time around. However, I have already gathered all the ancient jades. Once I advance to the Dou Di class, your three clans and the Sky Mansion Alliance will be completely eliminated from the Dou Qi continent!”</p>
 <p>Hun Tiandi looked at Xiao Yan before his eyes turned towards Gu Yuan. A dense cold smile was slowly lifted on his face. His body was slowly pulled back. Finally, he stepped into the black hole. The black hole shook and swiftly vanished. After which, the black flame that covered the place quickly paled...</p>
 <p>“Gu Yuan, just you wait. The next time we meet, all of you will tremble and bow under my feet. Ha ha!”</p>
 <p>The black hole disappeared. However, Hun Tiandi’s dark and cold laughter continued to reverberate across the sky for a long time…</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the spot where the black hole had disappeared. His expression was cold as he involuntarily clenched his hands tightly. It was unexpected that the combined effort of the three clans and the Sky Mansion Alliance was unable to hold the Hun clan back. The latter was really too strong...</p>
