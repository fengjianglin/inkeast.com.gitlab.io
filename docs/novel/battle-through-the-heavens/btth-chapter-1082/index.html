 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1082: Successful Obtainment</u></strong></p>
 <p>The instant the head of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast burst apart, the fat and skinny experts, who were fighting with the Little Fairy Doctor, also sensed something. They turned their heads and looked at the enormous cold corpse, which was lying on the ground in the distance. Their expressions suddenly and drastically changed.</p>
 <p>The eyes of the two looked at the corpse of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. Disbelief filled their eyes. Being the beast’s subordinates, they were clearly aware of its strength. Even though there were a countless number of vicious poison beings within this Fallen God Stream, the strength of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was ranked among the top. In the past, there were some human experts who had come to provoke it, but their fates were to become part of the yellow soil in this region. The fierce reputation of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was something that no one dared offend during these years…</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the scene that had appeared today had caused the fierce reputation of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast to completely disappear…</p>
 <p>The skinny, yellow-clothed man stared at the corpse of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast with flickering eyes. After which, he looked at Xiao Yan’s group again. His throat quievered. Other than Xiao Yan, the remaining two people gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. This kind of feeling was something that he had sensed on the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast in the past. Clearly, these two were existences that were on the same level as the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p>
 <p>“I wonder how leader offended such an expert. They actually came hunting for him…” The yellow-clothed man’s eyes flickered as this thought swiftly lingered in his heart.</p>
 <p>“You dared our kill leader? The Scorpion Dragon Tribe will definitely not let you off!” The fat expert, who looked like a small mountain, was dull for a moment before he finally recovered. He furiously roared, “Gan Hou, attack, take revenge for the leader!”</p>
 <p>The flicker in the eyes of the yellow-clothed man became more intense. He immediately clenched his teeth and said in a deep voice, “I will not accompany you if you wish to seek death!”</p>
 <p>His toes pressed on the ground after those words sounded, and he withdrew in a lightning-like manner. Within a couple of breaths, he had transformed into a blurry figure that disappeared into the distance.</p>
 <p>The fat man was stunned when he saw the yellow-clothed man fleeing at the last moment. His face immediately flushed red as he furiously cursed, “You cowardly fellow!”</p>
 <p>“Are you going to leave by yourself or should I attack?” The Little Fairy Doctor slowly walked over while he was cursing. Her pretty eyes stared at the fat man as she asked him a question with a smile.</p>
 <p>That fat man’s face quivered when he saw the Little Fairy Doctor slowly walking over. After the fight earlier, he was aware that this lady, who seemed to be smaller than his arm, possessed an unusually frightening strength. Even when he had joined hands with Gan Hou, they were barely able to hold her back. Now that Gan Hou had fled, how could he alone be a match for the Little Fairy Doctor?</p>
 <p>“The Scorpion Dragon Tribe will not let you off!”</p>
 <p>The expression of the fat man changed before he finally let out a furious cry. After which, he turned around and his small, mountain-like body rumbled as it transformed into a ray of light that fled into the distance. Although his body was large, he was not a fool. If he remained behind in such a situation, it was likely that he would not be able to escape death. This group of people could even kill the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, much less him.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor watched as the fat man fled into the distance. She let out a slight smile. Her body moved and appeared beside Xiao Yan. She lowered her head to look at the enormous body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast on the ground, “Settled?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan grinned and nodded. He immediately sighed in relief. This Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was indeed extremely difficult to deal with. If he did not have the Earth Demon Puppet and Tian Huo zun-zhe, it would have been very difficult to kill this big fellow with his strength unless he used the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame.</p>
 <p>“Let’s swiftly take the items we need. The commotion this battle created is too large. It is unavoidable for it to attract the attention of the other fierce Magical Beasts in the Fallen God Stream. If we are careless, we might end up with another fierce battle,” The Little Fairy Doctor whispered. The poison beings in this Fallen God Stream were extremely ferocious. Any that possessed some strength were definitely extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded in agreement. His hand grabbed toward the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. A suction force surged out and slowly lifted it until it was suspended in the air.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at the large corpse in front of him. His face appeared a little solemn. The seal formed by his hands changed and the enormous jade-green fire wolf burst apart, transforming into a fierce flame that swept over the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. Its frighteningly high temperature spread, and a distortion appeared in the surrounding space.</p>
 <p>Amid the burning of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the enormous corpse of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast swiftly shrank. Its skin, shell, and flesh slowly turned white under the high temperature. Finally, they transformed into ashes and scattered down.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s expression did not change as watched the corpse that was swiftly shrinking while ashes scattered. Instead, he increased the temperature. What he needed was the Essence Blood of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. This kind of Essence Blood would only appear after undergoing refinement and lots of burning…</p>
 <p>Under this high temperature, the fresh blood on the surface of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was swiftly vaporized. The blood vessels at those injuries also turned pale-white…</p>
 <p>The body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast diminished as the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame’s temperature continued to rise. In the end, it was only five feet in size. At this moment, the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast had turned into a blood-colored ball of meat, rotating within the jade-green flame.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan controlled the flame’s temperature. A moment later, he flicked his finger and the blood-colored ball of meat immediately cracked, forming a fissures in its body. Half-a-fist-large blood-colored crystal rushed out and headed toward Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>With a grabbing motion, Xiao Yan caught this fresh-blood-like crystal in his hand. He sensed the vast and mighty energy within it and a pleased expression involuntarily flashed across his eyes. He had finally obtained the Monster Core of this rank 7 Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s hand slowly rubbed the crystal core in a gentle manner before he carefully stored it in his Storage Ring. He raised his eyes, and they paused on the blood-colored flesh in the flame. There was still the powerful Essence Blood of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast within…</p>
 <p>After gently clenching his hand, the jade-green flame that lingered outside of the blood-colored ball of meat began to rapidly spin. A terrifying tearing force, ungoverned by any rules, swiftly formed within it. After which, it ruthlessly squeezed the ball of blood-colored meat.</p>
 <p>The blood-colored ball of meat trembled intensely as the flame wildly spun. It repeatedly rotated left and right. In the face of such a rotation, droplets of somewhat purplish-colored blood were slowly revealed from within the meat…</p>
 <p>A pleased look appeared on the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth when he saw this scene. He maintained this kind of tearing force and gradually squeezed out the pure Essence Blood within that cluster of meat…</p>
 <p>With an increasing amount of Essence Blood dripping down, the blood-red ball of meat gradually turned a pale-white color…</p>
 <p>This kind of pale whiteness was a kind of lifeless color. The Essence Blood was the source of a Magical Beast’s life. Once the Essence Blood was drained, it indicated that its life had also vanished!</p>
 <p>The pale-white color gradually spread from the high speed rotation of the flame. Around ten minutes later, the last trace of blood-coloring finally faded quietly from the ball of meat…</p>
 <p>The moment the last thread of blood color gradually disappeared, the ball of meat violently trembled and collapsed, transforming into pale-white ashes that scattered down.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief as he watched the ball of meat collapse and burst apart. His gaze landed on the flame. There was a cluster of purple-red liquid blood the size of a fist there. Despite being a great distance away, Xiao Yan was able to sense the powerful energy that was spreading from this liquid blood.</p>
 <p>“Store it quickly. This kind of Essence Blood possesses a potent allure to other Magical Beasts…”</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor hurriedly reminded while sighing in relief after seeing the Essence Blood successfully refined by Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He beckoned with his finger and the purple-red liquid blood flew out. After which, he took out a jade bottle and carefully stored the blood into it.</p>
 <p>“Old mister Yao, this is the Essence Blood required to help refine your body. You will once again be able to use a physical body soon.” Xiao Yan waved the jade bottle in his hand toward Tian Huo zun-zhe by the side as he spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>A hearty smile involuntarily surfaced on Tian Huo zun-zhe’s face when he heard this. He nodded in relief. It had been so many years. He was finally going to possess a body again. At the same time, he would once again sense the comfort of having Dou Qi flow within his body.</p>
 <p>“Little fellow, the old me is really right about you… this favor, the old me will not forget it for the rest of my life.”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe’s illusionary hand patted Xiao Yan’s shoulders. Even with his calmness, he still felt somewhat excited in his heart. Back then, he had placed his hopes in Xiao Yan in his desperate state because he had no other choice. However, he was quite pleased with the final result.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan slightly smiled as he sincerely said, “Old mister Yao has been a great help to me. If I do not put in all my effort, would I not be considered an inhumane and unjust person?”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe fondled his beard and let out a heartfelt sigh, “I really envy your teacher for having such an outstanding disciple…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan softly laughed, but did not add anything to this topic. His eyes swept around him. Due to the death of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, this region had become dead quiet. There was not the least bit of unusual sound.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. We should leave this place first. The commotion we caused was too great. It is likely that someone will come and investigate. It is best that we leave first.” The Little Fairy Doctor softly suggested.</p>
 <p>“Alright…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He rubbed his Storage Ring and laughed, “Since we have obtained everything, we will proceed to the most important step next!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his hand after speaking. He took the lead and turned around. After which, he hurriedly rushed to the north. The Little Fairy Doctor brought Xin Lan along and followed close behind him.</p>
 <p>This region once again fell silent after Xiao Yan’s group left. Only the enormous pit in the ground represented the soul-stirring fight that had erupted at this spot earlier…</p>
