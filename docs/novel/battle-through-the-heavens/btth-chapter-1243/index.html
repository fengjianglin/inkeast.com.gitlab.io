 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1243: The Fire Path With Another Secret</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Sizzle!”</p>
 <p>The purple-brown flame was wrapped around Little Fairy Doctor’s group. It was just like a fire dragon that arrogantly rushed out from amongst the countless number of people. It brought about some chaos as he directly rushed into the unusually hot fire path.</p>
 <p>After charging into the fire path, the surrounding temperature had clearly been raised by dozens of times. The surrounding hard bright red stones were burned until they were completely red. The hot lava below continued to splutter out like a spring. Those hot rock fragments contained in the lava also possessed quite a great lethal force. If he was careless, it might penetrate through the Dou Qi and cause one’s to end up being completely pierced.</p>
 <p>However, this fire path, which might be quite troublesome to the others, did not possess the slightest difficulty to Xiao Yan. With the Three Thousand Lotus Heart Flame protecting the body, regardless of whether it was the lava or the surrounding demonic blue fire pillars that were shot out, they were unable to cause any harm towards Xiao Yan. The use of the Heavenly Flame was completely revealed at this moment.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there were quite a number of experts charging forward with all their strength. Majestic Dou Qi covered their bodies until there was not the slightest gap formed. Although they were able to endure it and charge in, they were clearly not as relaxed as Xiao Yan’s group. These blue flame possessed a mysterious effect of melting Dou Qi. When the two were engaged in a stalemate, the rate at which one exhaust Dou Qi would far exceed the expectations of many. Base on this rate of consumption, even an elite Dou Zong would not be able to endure for long.</p>
 <p>While these people endured the flame and lava as they fiercely charging forward, they also saw Xiao Yan’s group, which appeared to be progressing in a relaxed manner. All of their eyes were a little stunned.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored these gazes. A thought passed through his heart and the purple-brown flame withered. It left everyone behind as it swiftly rushed into the deep parts of the fire path.</p>
 <p>With the help of the Heavenly Flame, Xiao Yan’s group advancement rate was quite rapid. Within a short few minutes, they had directly passed some of the experts, who had entered earlier than them. Even though this was the case, they were still unable to see the end of the fire path.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed worthy of being the remains left behind by an elite Dou Sheng. This fire path is actually so long. It looks like some people are going to be unlucky…” Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily laughed softly when she saw this scene.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also smiled and nodded. The surrounding blue flame was extremely mysterious. They were able to melt Dou Qi. Those who wish to rely on the strength of one’s Dou Qi to forcefully barge in would indeed be unlucky. Unless it was some extremely powerful experts, otherwise, those who could rely on Dou Qi to pass through such a long fire path would be an extreme minority.</p>
 <p>Based on Xiao Yan’s expectations, it was likely that just this entry fire path would have eliminated many people.</p>
 <p>“Hey, isn’t that the Ice River Valley’s group in front?” Tian Huo zun-zhe swept his eyes over the front of the tunnel and suddenly said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan raised his brows and took a glance upon hearing this. Indeed, he saw a large cluster of white coloured fog permeating the area a short distance in front. One could vaguely see some human figures within the fog. Xiao Yan was extremely familiar with those cold air. It was the unique icy cold Dou Qi of the Ice River Valley.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>While Xiao Yan’s group eyes were being shot over, Bing He zun-zhe, who was within the icy cold fog, also appeared to have sensed Xiao Yan’s group behind. Immediately, he let out a cold snort. He waved his large sleeve and the cold air that wrapped around the experts from the Ice River Valley transformed into a cold glow. Its speed swiftly increased and disappeared from the sight of Xiao Yan’s group.</p>
 <p>“These terrible characters, are they running so quickly because they are afraid that we will attack them?” Xiong Zhan parted his mouth and spoke with disdain when he saw this.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. With their current lineup, there would not be afraid of an Ice River Valley. If they were to really fight, it was likely that the one who needed to be worried was Bing He zun-zhe.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, I have a feeling that something is not quite right with this fire path. Let’s leave first before talking…” Xiao Yan’s eyes swept over the surrounding blue flame. His brows involuntarily frowned slightly. Although this flame was not a Heavenly Flame, it was also extremely strange. Ordinary Dou Qi would appear like a catalyst in front of this kind of flame. Not only would it be unable to extinguish the flame but would end up causing the flame to become increasingly fierce.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeves after uttering those words. Their speed rose suddenly as they transformed into a fire glow that shot explosively towards the end of the fire path.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group charge wildly for some distance while riding the fire glow. Along the way, they were able to meet some people, who had terrible expressions, alone. The thing that surprised them was that the people from the Ice River Valley had actually completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>“The situation is not quite right. It is impossible for the speed of those people from the Ice River Valley to exceed ours…” Little Fairy Doctor’s brows were knitted tightly before she finally uttered in a deep voice a moment later.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan reduced his speed a little. His eyes flickered slightly. After which, he raised his head and looked into the deep parts of the fire path. That place was still completely bright red in colour. There was not the slightest trace of its end.</p>
 <p>“This fire path is really too damn long. Is the end really in front of us?” Xiong Zhan also cursed somewhat impatiently.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was suddenly startled when he heard these words. He immediately lowered his body. Those eyes of his flickered, appearing as though he had understood something. He spoke in a deep voice, “This fire path is a trap. The path in front of us is not the true route into the remains. If we continue to travel through the fire path, the Dou Qi within our bodies will be exhausted sooner or later.”</p>
 <p>“If this fire path is not the true entrance, where is the true entrance then?” Little Fairy Doctor raised her eyebrows. Her eyes also looked towards the bright red walls beside her when she spoke. Those walls were built from an extremely hard bright red magma rock. Even Xiao Yan’s group was unable to identify just what this kind of rock was. However, it was definitely not an ordinary thing if it could be selected by an elite Dou Sheng to built this remains. It was obvious that one should not attempt to break it with brute force.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan revealed an expression of deep thought. His eyes suddenly shifted downwards a moment later. Finally, he paused it on the bright red viscous magma below and slowly said, “The reason why the members of the Ice River Valley had disappeared is likely because Bing He zun-zhe had discovered the true entrance. However, the left right and top of this tunnel are rock walls…”</p>
 <p>“You mean… the path is not in front but below?” Little Fairy Doctor asked in surprised.</p>
 <p>“The owner of this remains is indeed cunning. Which ordinary person would leap into the lava for no reason…” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s face was similarly a stunned one.</p>
 <p>“Hee, no wonder the members of the Ice River Valley was in a hurry to shake us off. They are actually unwilling for us to find the true entrance.” Xiao Yan laughed. He gave a reminder to everyone before waving his sleeve. Purple-brown flame wrapped around everyone. With a ‘splash’ sound, they directly entered the hot bright red lava.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group swiftly sunk after entering the lava. Although the lava was hot, it pose no obstruction to everyone, who had the protection of a Heavenly Flame. Hence, after this sinking continued for around a minute, everyone could hear a slight muffled sound. The area under their feet became empty and they fell for a certain distance. Finally, their feet once again stood on the icy cold ground.</p>
 <p>Everyone hurriedly raised their heads to take a look after their feet landed. A shocked expression immediately covered their faces. The Bright red lava appeared like numerous huge pythons above their heads. They adopted a ring shape as they hung above in a distorted manner. One could vaguely see some human figures occasionally rushing past the fire path. Clearly, this lava was the fire path that Xiao Yan’s group had travelled through earlier. If one was to really follow such a long fire path, there was no telling just how long it would take to travel to the end.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, it is indeed deserving of being an ancient remains. To think that it has actually fooled everyone. If these people reached the end of the fire path after much difficulty only to discover a rock wall at the end, would they end up being so furious that they would die on the spot?” Xiao Yan looked at the bending fire path and involuntarily spoke in a somewhat gloating manner.</p>
 <p>Little Fairy Doctor’s group also involuntarily laughed upon hearing this.</p>
 <p>“It seems that those who has entered in the past has never found the true entrance. However, perhaps it is because of the seal but these traps were also not completely activated. Therefore, it had allowed some lucky fellows to enter…” Little Fairy Doctor reasoned.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. His eyes swept around. The current location of theirs was an extremely spacious large stone path. The path extended for a great distance. It was possible to vaguely see a square there. There seemed to be some human figures on the square.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. This place should likely be able to truly enter the remains. However, our target is the Soul Baby Fruit. We will let them go and snatch for the Tian class Dou Skill first. We will discuss about everything else once we have obtained the Soul Baby Fruit.” Xiao Yan mused for a moment before speaking in a solemn manner.</p>
 <p>Everyone nodded upon hearing this.</p>
 <p>“Once we enter the hall, the matter of finding the Soul Baby Fruit will be left to Zi Yan. Zi Yan, you have a special perception when it comes to finding this kind of natural treasure. It will be much faster for you to search for it rather than all of us randomly doing so.” Xiao Yan looked towards Zi Yan and instructed.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, this is a small matter. Leave it to me.” Zi Yan nodded. She was extremely happy to take the initiative when it came to searching for natural treasures.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he saw this. His toes pressed on the ground and his body transformed into a blurry figure that rushed towards the square in the distance. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest swiftly followed from behind.</p>
 <p>The path was not considered long. With the speed of Xiao Yan’s group, they had appeared on the square after a couple of minutes. At the same time, they discovered that there were already quite a number of people who had arrived on the square beforehand. Most of these people were those who were the fastest to charge in. Amongst them include the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, Ice River Valley etc.</p>
 <p>The sudden appearance of Xiao Yan’s group also attracted the attention of everyone on the square. Bing He zun-zhe frowned slightly. Clearly, he did not expect that Xiao Yan’s group would discover the mystery of the fire path so quickly.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored these gazes. His eyes paused at the edge of the square when he stepped into the place. There was an extremely heavy stone door at that spot. Ten straight spear like bodies stood at that spot without any movement. The skin of these bodies were bright silver in colour. Their eyes were hollow and they were expressionless. It was as though they were some old corpse.</p>
 <p>“Earth Demon Puppet?”</p>
 <p>The corner of Xiao Yan’s eyes twitched involuntarily when he saw the existence of these corpse like being. His heart was extremely shocked as he muttered.</p>
