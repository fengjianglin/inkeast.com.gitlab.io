 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1353: Opening the Crystal Wall</u></strong></p>
 <p>The smile on Xiao Yan’s face was slowly withdrawn after storing the many energy cores into his Storage Ring. His eyes were grave as he looked at the crystal wall in front of him. At this moment, one could see some wiggling insect figures embedded in the crystal wall. Wave after wave of liquid energy continued to seep out of the wall. After which, it solidified and adhered to the crystal wall…</p>
 <p>“You two, I shall leave the sides to the both of you…” Xiao Yan turned his head and spoke to Huo Zhi and Yao Xing Ji.</p>
 <p>Huo Zhi nodded when she heard his words. On the other hand, Yao Xing Ji merely glanced at Xiao Yan. Although he did not say anything, it was obvious that he was a little displeased in his heart that Xiao Yan was issuing orders.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>Yao Xing Ji withdrew his eyes. He moved his hands and a cluster of pale-black flames surfaced above his palm. A strange wind sound vaguely whistled when the flame materialized. One would feel an unusual irritation when this wind sound was transmitted into one’s ears. It was as though this kind of unusual sound could stir one’s emotions.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>All the eyes present slide over when they saw the pale-black Heavenly Flame in Yao Xing Ji’s hands. Their eyes were a little surprised. Something like a Heavenly Flame was far too rare. Even though they were members of the ancient clans, they could not simply see them just because they wanted to.</p>
 <p>“Nine Serene Wind Flame, ranked tenth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking…” The corner of Yao Xing Ji’s mouth was involuntarily lifted when he saw everyone’s surprised eyes. He smiled faintly and introduced the flame.</p>
 <p>“Nine Serene Wind Flame…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes also paused on this black flame. Being an alchemist, he had naturally heard of this thing. All Heavenly Flames formed in an extremely bizarre. An example was the Three Thousand Burning Flame, which was formed within the empty realm. This Nine Serene Wind Flame, on the other hand, was born from an endlessly deep abyss. Dark wind never ceased blowing all year round in that place. Even an ordinary elite Dou Zun would not dare to venture into it. This so-called Nine Serene Wind Flame was formed with the intense wind.</p>
 <p>One would not only require luck to obtain this Nine Serene Wind Flame. There was still a need to possess an extremely powerful strength. Based on Xiao Yan’s guess, the price that the Yao clan had to pay to obtain this Heavenly Flame was not small.</p>
 <p>“Puff!”</p>
 <p>A slight noise suddenly appeared when everyone’s eyes had gathered on the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji’s hand. A deep-red color slowly glowed within the crystal tunnel. Many eyes looked in the direction of the light, only to see a cluster of deep-red bewitching flames slowly rising on a hand. The flame had formed numerous red lotus shapes.</p>
 <p>Following the appearance of this deep-red flame, the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji’s hand became a little dimmer. Even the whistling wind had been greatly diminished. Yao Xing Ji’s face involuntarily twitched when he saw his own Heavenly Flame acting like this. Although he felt a little displeased, he could do nothing about it. The Red Lotus Ye Flame was ranked two places higher than his Nine Serene Wind Flame. There was naturally a gap between the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk, I think that this should be the Yan clan’s Red Lotus Ye Flame, right?” Gu Qing Yang looked at the Heavenly Flame in Huo Zhi’s hand. He could not help but smile and ask a clarifying question.</p>
 <p>“Aye.” Huo Ya tilted her head, but her pretty eyes shifted to Xiao Yan. Her eyes contained a strange feeling.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled when he saw Huo Zhi’s provoking eyes. This lady usually kept very quiet. However, it was unexpected that she would appear this wild when it came to something related to the Heavenly Flames.</p>
 <p>After exhaling gently, Xiao Yan gently clenched his hand. Threads of different colored flames seeped from his finger. They gathered together and turned into a cluster of purple-brown flames with a strand of a dense whiteness in it. The flame churned and numerous dragon fire seedlings continued to rise from within the flame. There was a vague dragon roar being emitted!</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>The red lotuses above the Red Lotus Ye Flame on Huo Zhi’s hand began to fluctuate when the Heavenly Flame in Xiao Yan’s hand appeared. It felt as though it had become illusory. On the other side, the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji’s hand, which had already become somewhat dim after being suppressed by the Red Lotus Ye Flame, had become even dimmer. Even the whistling wind being emitted from it had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>“Although your Heavenly Flame’s ranking is not ranked among the top, your Heavenly Flame is comparable to that of the top six Heavenly Flames after your merger… however, you are likely the first since ancient times to perform the crazy act of merging Heavenly Flames…” Huo Ya’s pretty eyes revealed a fluctuation within them. A low and enchanting voice was emitted from under her veil.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was noncommittal toward these words. Merging Heavenly Flames might appear crazy, but it was not impossible. These words spoken as if he was the first to merge Heavenly Flames were likely untrue. At the very least, the owner who created the mysterious Qi Method called the Flame Mantra had merged Heavenly Flames…</p>
 <p>“Alright, we are pressed for time. Let’s act now…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan did not have time to discuss the matter of merging Heavenly Flames with Huo Zhi. After seeing that the other two had summoned their Heavenly Flames, Xiao Yan took a couple of steps forward and stopped in front of the crystal wall. He spoke in a deep voice, “Everyone should follow close. Do not get left behind!”</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Flame in Xiao Yan’s hand suddenly soared when his voice appeared. It began to fiercely burn as a deafening dragon roared. A purple-brown dragon rushed out of the flame. It ruthlessly collided with the thick crystal wall. Sharp dragon claws danced as the crystal wall burst apart, forming a large hole.</p>
 <p>“Follow me!”</p>
 <p>The tail of the fire dragon was connected to Xiao Yan’s hand. He sternly cried out and violently stomped his foot on the ground. His body swiftly charged forward. Gu Qing Yang and the rest followed close behind him!</p>
 <p>“What great flame control ability…”</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed across Huo Zhi’s pretty eyes when she saw Xiao Yan transform the flame into a fire dragon which began to open the crystal walls. She swiftly followed, and the deep-red flame in her hand swept out at the same time and covered the crystal wall to the left. Its frighteningly high temperature quickly slowed the speed of the closing crystal wall.</p>
 <p>Yao Xing Ji on the other side had also begun to work. Although he was a little displeased that Xiao Yan was in command, the most important thing now was his life. He could be at odds with everyone, but he could not be at odds with his own life. Hence, he had also put in all his effort when he acted.</p>
 <p>The fire dragon whistled and rushed forward within the crystal wall. The frightening temperature had completely incinerated the Ancient Devouring Insects hidden in the wall from some distance away. Despite this being the case, the Ancient Devouring Insects continued to surge over like moths attracted to a flame. The enormous energy that seeped out also pose quite a great obstruction to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang bang!”</p>
 <p>Explosions continued to be heard within the crystal wall. The advancement speed of Xiao Yan’s group had become much faster.</p>
 <p>“This kind of exhaustion is really too frightening…”</p>
 <p>While his body was swiftly advancing, Xiao Yan also sensed the Dou Qi within his body seeping out like floodwater. His eyes had become much more solemn as he clenched his hand. A bag appeared in it. However. he did not take anything out. Instead, he grabbed the brag, circulated his Qi Method and swiftly absorbed the energy within the energy cores. After which, he poured it into the body of the fire dragon in front, which was doing its best to open the crystal wall.</p>
 <p>“How much further is it?” The expressions of Gu Qing Yang and the rest behind had become grave when they saw Xiao Yan devouring energy cores like a whale devouring plankton. The crystal wall was extremely hard, and the Ancient Devouring Insects were blocking him. Even though Xiao Yan possessed a Heavenly Flame, it was still not as easy as he had imagined.</p>
 <p>“It will take another half an hour or so before we will break through the light curtain.” That silver-robed man mused.</p>
 <p>Gu Qing Yang slightly noddes. All he could do was hope that Xiao Yan could endure…</p>
 <p>Ferocious explosions occurred along the way. The rumbling sound did not cease, and the atmosphere of the tunnel was quite tense. Their hearts would involuntarily pound each time they saw Xiao Yan absorb the energy cores one bag at a time. This kind of exhaustion was really too frightening.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The fire dragon whistled and heavily collided with the crystal wall. Crystals shot in all directions as Xiao Yan’s feet slowed. He spoke in a deep voice, “There is no more energy cores…”</p>
 <p>The faces of quite a number of people twitched when they heard his words. Gu Qing Yang mused for a moment and swiftly took out a bright energy core. He handed it to Xiao Yan, “This is a nine star energy core. I only have one…”</p>
 <p>“It’s not enough!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan received it without any hesitation, but he still shook his head. Ten percent of the Dou Qi within his body was exhausted every meter they advanced. A nine star energy core might be powerful, but it was still not enough to support them through the light curtain.</p>
 <p>“I also have one here…” Huo Xuan hesitated for a moment before taking out another nine star energy core.</p>
 <p>“Give me another three of them!” Xiao Yan exhaled and called on everyone.</p>
 <p>Everyone became quiet when they heard his words. After all, a nine star energy core was a precious thing.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, if we end up dying here, possessing many energy cores will be pointless.” That man from the Lei clan sighed. He flicked his finger and an energy core shot into Xiao Yan’s hand.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I will trouble brother Xiao Yan…” The two large men from the Shi clan faced each other before swiftly handing an energy core to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes involuntarily landed upon the Hun Ya duo at the back after the Shi clan handed over their energy core. Hun Ya’s eyelids twitched when he saw their gazes. At this moment, he also understood that his words were useless. All he could do was clench his teeth, take out an energy core, and toss it to Xiao Yan. In order to obtain this nine star energy core, Hun Li and him had put in a lot of effort for a prolonged period of time. It was unexpected that they would now have to hand it to a person that they did not see eye-to-eye with.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan held the five nine star energy cores in his hand and slowly sighed. A punch was thrown out. The fire glow on the fire dragon in front of him suddenly soared. It transformed into a fire figure that instantly penetrated through layer after layer of wall like a thunderbolt. Xiao Yan’s group swiftly followed it from behind.</p>
 <p>This kind of all out forward charge continued for nearly half an hour. The fire glow in the fire dragon finally began to gradually dim.</p>
 <p>“We are about to exit…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gave a low cry as he observed the dimming fire dragon. He lifted his head and looked at the emerald-like crystal wall in front of him. Densely packed Ancient Devouring Insects had covered their trail. Only by charging forward would they be able to truly enter the third level of the Heavenly Tomb.</p>
 <p>“Huh? This is?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes drifted just as the fire dragon was about to violently collide with the emerald wall. They focused on something in the middle of that crystal wall. There was a fist-sized creature emitting a pale-red light at that spot. Looking from a distance, it appeared just like an insect cocoon!</p>
