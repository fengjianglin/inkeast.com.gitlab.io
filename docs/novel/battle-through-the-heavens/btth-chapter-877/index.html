 <p><strong><u>Chapter 877: Nine Dragon Lightning Flame</u></strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Yan looked at the lady who did not dare to move even a little after having her neck grabbed by him and was startled. This was because this lady was the ‘Pan’s Gate’s’ alchemist whom he had met earlier, Xin Lan.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Xin Lan did not dare to make any unusual movements due to her neck being gripped by Xiao Yan. This was especially the case when she had sensed the genuine killing intent that filled his eyes. Her pretty face was mixed with a thread of moving paleness while her eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>“Why is it you?” Xiao Yan frowned slightly after identifying the lady. He questioned in a deep voice, “You were eavesdropping on us?”</p>
 <p>“It is actually you, little girl? What farce is this! This place is an important one in the Inner Academy, how can you just randomly budge in?” Su Qian by the side reprimanded. His expression sank slightly after the shock from earlier dissipated.</p>
 <p>Xin Lan gently bit her lips in the face of Su Qian’s reprimand. She said, “Grandpa Su, Xin Lan has only barged in unintentionally.”</p>
 <p>“Is First Elder acquainted with her?” Xiao Yan was involuntarily stunned when he heard the way Su Qian addressed Xin Lan. His gaze turned to Su Qian as he posed the question.</p>
 <p>“Yes, uh, this girl is the granddaughter of an old friend of mine. She was sent over to this place last year, and he asked me to take care and groom her.” Su Qian smiled bitterly and nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan only came to a sudden understanding when he heard this. He immediately released his hand, which had still been tightly wrapped around Xin Lan’s neck, and said in a faint voice, “Since you were able to eavesdrop for such a long time right in front of First Elder Su Qian’s and my eyes, you should have likely consumed some medicinal pill that can hide your aura. You don’t appear to have unintentionally intruded. Instead, you appear to have come prepared?”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan’s face involuntarily reddened slightly under the focus of Xiao Yan’s dark-black eyes. She immediately clenched her silver teeth and said. “I did indeed come and eavesdrop on purpose. Why are you so fierce? Moreover, I can tell you that if you plan to put your attention on the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame, you would only end up offending a powerful faction for no reason.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Xiao Yan was startled as he asked in a deep voice. He had obtained a little information regarding the ‘Heavenly Flame’ after much difficulty. How could he easily give it up?</p>
 <p>“Earlier, I said that the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame has been passed on within the Burning Flame Valley for hundreds of years. The past experts over the generations have left behind a blood spiritual imprint within its essence that is difficult to remove. Unless you practice the key Qi Method of the Burning Flame Valley, ‘Green Profound Serene Flame Skill,’ you will definitely not be able to truly own it even if you managed to obtain the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.” Xin Lan held her snow-white long neck and let out successive coughs before explaining with a cold smile.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart immediately sank when he heard this. He frowned and asked, “First Elder, is what she said true?”</p>
 <p>Su Qian’s face was filled with uncertainty in the face of Xiao Yan’s words. Immediately, he could only smile bitterly and shake his head. He said, “I am not aware of this. However, if Xin Lan says that it is like this, then it should be true. Ugh, no wonder the Burning Flame Valley is able to preserve the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame. Their preparation method is so secretive. The old me has really underestimated them.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart completely sank when he heard Su Qian speak. Was this clue that he had obtained with much difficulty completely useless?</p>
 <p>“Xin Lan comes from the Central Plains of the Dou Qi continent. The Burning Flame Valley is located in that area. Therefore, she has some understanding of them. Moreover, given her character, she should likely not be lying on purpose.” Su Qian helped by revealing Xin Lan’s background, like he was afraid that Xiao Yan would not believe what she said.</p>
 <p>“Central Plains?” The foreign name caused Xiao Yan to be somewhat lost.</p>
 <p>“The Central Plains is the name that is used to call the middle region of the Dou Qi continent. That region is extremely enormous with a countless number of intricate and complicated factions as well as strange ethnic groups one would have difficulty seeing. Therefore, it can be said that this is the central area of the Dou Qi continent. That place is the most exciting one in the Dou Qi continent… the peak experts of the continent mostly come from that area.” Su Qian smiled and explained after seeming to understand Xiao Yan’s lost look. “Moreover, there, you might be able to obtain some information related to the background of your little female friend.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart, which had just sank, once again leaped suddenly upon hearing Su Qian’s words. He let out a gentle breath as the displeased and joyful yet exquisite face of a young lady slowly surfaced in his mind. The warm smile that she wore on her face was just like the spring breeze that slowly caused Xiao Yan to calm down.</p>
 <p>After calming down, Xiao Yan engaged in deep thoughts for a moment before he abruptly turned to Xin Lan by his side. His eyes narrowed as he slowly said, “You should have something to say, right?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart carried some doubt toward Xin Lan since she had eavesdropped on the conversation between him and First Elder Su Qian without any reason. The former’s character did not seem to be brainless. She should be aware that eavesdropping was a taboo. If she had not been spurred on by some reason, she definitely would not have done something like this.</p>
 <p>Xin Lan’s expression was somewhat naturally turned red since she was being stared at by Xiao Yan. She was quiet for a moment before she clenched her silver teeth and said, “Do you really wish to find some clues about a ‘Heavenly Flame?’”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>“You can forget about the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame. The Burning Flame Valley has passed it down for centuries. They already possess a nearly perfect preservation method for it. Even if you are able to obtain it, you would not be able to use it…” Xin Lan hesitated for a moment after seeing Xiao Yan nod his head heavily before she slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Do you have a method to resolve it?”</p>
 <p>“No…” Xin Lan shook her head as she looked at Xiao Yan’s suddenly bright eyes. When she saw the latter frown, she could only curl her mouth and say, “I do not have a method to allow you to resolve the issue, but I do know of a clue about another ‘Heavenly Flame,’ ranked even higher than the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame! Moreover, as long as you have the ability, your chances of obtaining it will not be less than snatching the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, who had just sat on his chair, suddenly straightened his body upon hearing this. His eyes were heated as he looked at Xin Lan. An excitement that was difficult to hide was present within his voice, “Another ‘Heavenly Flame?’”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan was also shocked when she saw Xiao Yan’s excitement. She took a small step back before nodding slightly.</p>
 <p>“Tell me. Regardless of what you want, I will give it to you as long as I have the ability to do it!” Xiao Yan stepped forward and spoke in a heated voice.</p>
 <p>“It is not impossible for me to tell you. However, you must first tell me if you are currently a tier 6 alchemist?” A nervousness surfaced within Xin Lan’s eyes as she opened her mouth to ask. Only after seeing Xiao Yan nod his head did an unusual glint appear in her eyes. The back of her teeth bit her lower lip and her delicate hand tensed and relaxed for awhile. Only then did she inhale a deep breath and say, “I will tell you the clue about the ‘Heavenly Flame’ if you promise to help me with one thing!”</p>
 <p>“Speak!” Xiao Yan did not hesitate as he replied in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Help my clan return to its Elder’s Seat in the Pill Tower once again!” Xin Lan’s delicate hand suddenly tightened. A clear yet anxious voice suddenly sounded in the hall.</p>
 <p>“Pill Tower?” Xiao Yan was slightly startled when he heard this name which was not considered too foreign. His brows immediately knit together. This special faction that was formed by alchemists possessed an extremely high position within the Dou Qi continent. Although he was not clear about the ranking within it, he could vaguely guess that the requirements to enter an Elder’s Seat were extremely harsh. Hence, a momentary hesitation also surfaced within Xiao Yan’s heart in front of this foreign great being.</p>
 <p>“Xin Lan, don’t fool around. It is easier said than done in order to allow your clan to return to the Pill Tower once again. With Xiao Yan’s current tier 6 alchemist strength, it would be impossible for him to help your clan enter the Elder’s Seat once again. It is not as though you are not aware that the requirement there is extremely harsh. Unless one reaches the level of a tier 7 alchemist, the chances of success are extremely low!” The expression of Su Qian by the side changed slightly upon hearing her request. He then replied to her in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“I know that the current him might still not be able to do it. However, his talent is definitely extremely great in order to reach the level of a tier 6 alchemist at such an age. Moreover, this talent is also rarely seen even in the Pill Tower. If he is willing to go all out and help, my clan would not be completely without any chance.” Xin Lan was unmoved by Su Qian’s cry. She still stubbornly looked at Xiao Yan and said, “If you are willing to help me, I shall give you a clue about the ‘Heavenly Flame!’”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gradually sank into a silence in the face of Xin Lan’s nervous yet heated eyes. He had also adopted a certain respectful attitude toward that so-called Pill Tower. The abilities of this special faction were the most powerful he had seen with the exception of the ‘Hall of Souls.’ This kind of high end place would definitely possess an extremely intense competition. Although Xiao Yan had quite the confidence in his medicinal refining talent, that Pill Tower was a frightening place which gathered all the top alchemists in the Dou Qi continent. It was likely that the difficulty of making one’s way in there was not any less than heading to the ‘Hall of Soul’ and coming back alive.</p>
 <p>The heat in Xin Lan’s eyes was also slowly extinguished as though a cold water was poured over them when she saw Xiao Yan remain silent. She mocked herself. When she was about to turn around and leave, when Xiao Yan, who was silent for a moment longer, finally inhaled a deep breath of air and slowly said, “I am unaware of how difficult it is to help your clan regain the Elder’s Seat in the Pill Tower. Moreover, I also cannot guarantee that my help would allow you to achieve your aim. However, I can guarantee you that as long as you provide me with a useful clue about a ‘Heavenly Flame,’ I will do my best to go all out to help you! What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Xin Lan’s lovely body trembled when she heard Xiao Yan’s words. An excited mist surged in the former’s clear eyes. Regardless of whether this effort of hers bore fruit, she had at the very least brought a thread of hope in the face of her clan being extinguished. She hurriedly nodded her head.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly. He forcefully suppressed the anxiety and excitement in his heart as he slowly said, “Since that is the case… it should be your turn to inform me about the clue regarding a ‘Heavenly Flame’ that you know. I will judge whether this clue is worth such a reward.”</p>
