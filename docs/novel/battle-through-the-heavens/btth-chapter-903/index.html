 <p><strong><u>Chapter 903: Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique</u></strong></p>
 <p>The white-haired old man who called himself Yao Tian Huo smiled slightly when he saw Xiao Yan’s change in expression. He immediately waved his hand and indifferently said, “There is no need to be afraid. That was when I was still alive. The current me is merely a little spirit. Given your strength, it is enough to kill me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly sighed in relief without noticing it upon hearing this. He was quite cautious of this elite Dou Zun with a mysterious origin, especially if he was the previous owner of the Fallen Heart Flame.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe played with the Fallen Heart Flame in his hand. A moment later, he sighed and recalled his memories. He flicked his finger and the Fallen Heart Flame transformed into a fire snake that shot to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan carefully received the Fallen Heart Flame, but did not immediately absorb it into his body. He allowed it to linger on his hand. Only after he failed to discover anything wrong with it did he carefully absorb it into his body. When he regained the Fallen Heart Flame, the caution within Xiao Yan finally paled a little. He immediately smiled and courteously said, “This little fellow is reckless. I was not aware that old sir is present in this place. Please bear with me if I have offended you.”</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe waved his hand and glanced at Xiao Yan. He immediately pointed at the baby invisible flame and asked faintly, “Are you also interested in this Fallen Heart Flame?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart became cold upon hearing Tian Huo zun-zhe question. He immediately laughed dryly and said, “That is something that belonged to old sir when you were alive. The little me has luckily inherited a kind of Fallen Heart Flame. I am already satisfied..”</p>
 <p>“Little fellow, don’t use such tactics in front of me. When I was bluffing people on the Dou Qi continent, your grandfather might not even have been born.” Tian Huo zun-zhe smiled as he chastised.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt a little embarrassed when he heard this. This old fellow had already long seen through his thoughts.</p>
 <p>Tian Huo zun-zhe’s gaze was somewhat nostalgic as he looked at the Fallen Heart Flame. He slowly said, “The first Fallen Heart Flame I discovered when I came to search this place back then. I spent a couple of years before luckily subduing it. It is the flame within your body right now…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan lifted his ears when he suddenly heard Tian Huo zun-zhe speaking about the past. He also paid quite a lot of attention to the matter of the Fallen Heart Flame.</p>
 <p>“Back then, I relied on the little skill that I had, and was able to roam anywhere in the world. Hence, I did not leave after subduing the Fallen Heart Flame. Instead, I curiously investigated this deep magma world…” Tian Huo zun-zhe long drawn out breath contained a sigh, feeling somewhat regretful because of his recklessness back then.</p>
 <p>“After entering deep into the magma world, I had discovered a ‘Heavenly Flame’ seed within it. This discovery caused me to rejoice quite greatly. Hence, I greedily wanted to also subdue the Fallen Heart Flame ‘Heavenly Flame’ seed. In the end, the two flames mixed within my body. Not only were they unable to merge perfectly, but instead ostracized each other like enemies. The battle of the ‘Heavenly Flames’ caused my body to be seriously injured. At this moment, I was suddenly attacked…” Tian Huo zun-zhe sighed.</p>
 <p>“Those fire lizard people?” A thought passed through Xiao Yan’s heart as he probingly inquired.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you have also made contact with them…” Tian Huo zun-zhe was also somewhat surprised when he heard Xiao Yan’s words.</p>
 <p>“They were the ones who had surrounded and attacked me earlier. I only barged in after having no other choice.” Xiao Yan rubbed his head and dryly laughed.</p>
 <p>“Those fire lizard people seem to be the aboriginals living in this place. There are many of them. Moreover, there was no lack of ultimate experts who could contend against a Dou Zun. That time, I met a Dou Zun class lizard race expert. If I had been in my peak condition, I would have not been afraid of it. Unfortunately, the fighting of the two ‘Heavenly Flames’ had already caused my body to be seriously injured. You can also guess the ending after that. I suffered a fatal injury after that big battle. However, it was fortunate that these lizard race experts did not know about spatial strength. Hence, they had difficulty finding the place where I am hidden.” Tian Huo zun-zhe’s eyes had a somewhat astonishing appearance. It seemed that the big battle back then had been ingrained deep in his memory.</p>
 <p>“Although I had successfully hid my body, I had also suffered a serious injury. My body gradually crumble not long later. With my last breath, I released the mature Fallen Heart Flame I had subdued. My soul was attached to the Heavenly Flame seed, intending to use it to survive. However, after so many years, my soul was unable to endure. If no other people entered this place within two years, my soul might have completely vanished.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart moved slightly upon hearing this. From these words, this Tian Huo zun-zhe in front of him could not be said to be completely dead. Once one’s strength reaches the level of a Dou Zun, one still had the opportunity to revive unless even one’s spirit was scattered. One example was Yao Lao. As long as a body that could accommodate his soul was refined, he would be able to revive once again and return to his peak. However, Yao Lao’s soul was perfectly preserved. The soul of this Tian Huo zun-zhe in front of him, however, was quite thin. It was really difficult to say if he could recover…</p>
 <p>“After so many years, it is unexpected that the ‘Heavenly Flame’ seed back then had gradually evolved into a Heart Flame form. However, it is still at its infant stage.” Tian Huo zun-zhe beckoned with his hand and the infant Fallen Heart Flame was held within it. He smiled as he glanced at Xiao Yan. He faintly asked, “Do you wish to obtain it?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded his head honestly this time around. He immediately respectfully said, “Old mister, tell this little fellow of your conditions if you are willing to give this infant Fallen Heart Flame. As long as this little fellow is able to do it, I will not decline.”</p>
 <p>Although the other party had said that his current condition was one that Xiao Yan could easily kill, he didn’t fully trust these words. After all, no matter how one put it, the other party was a genuine Dou Zun. Xiao Yan would not believe that he did not have some hidden tactics. Hence, it was better if Xiao Yan acted more courteous before he became confident.</p>
 <p>The expression of Tian Huo zun-zhe did not change after hearing Xiao Yan’s words. He mused for a moment before slowly speaking, “It is not impossible for you to have it. However, you must help the old me. Of course, you can rest assured that I will give you a sufficient reward.”</p>
 <p>“Old mister, please speak.” Xiao Yan’s heart moved as he spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I can see that the fire strength within your body is extremely strong. Moreover, the flame contained an extremely faint wooden aura. I think that you should be an alchemist, right? Moreover, it is likely that your alchemist tier is quite high in order to subdue the Fallen Heart Flame, no?” Tian Huo zun-zhe smiled as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“He is indeed worthy of being an elite Dou Zun. All that he has left is a wisp of soul, but his eyesight is still so sharp.” Xiao Yan quietly praised while he nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>“Since you are an alchemist, you should also know how to repair one’s injured spirit, no?” Tian Huo zun-zhe softly laughed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed while he muttered an ‘as expected’ quietly within his heart. These Dou Zun class old demons were some monsters that were difficult to kill. As long as a little of their soul remained, they were able to be this tenacious. This thought flashed across Xiao Yan’s heart but his face descended into deep thought. Helping a Dou Zun class expert repair his soul was not an easy matter. Moreover, he had just met Tian Huo zun-zhe, and was completely unaware of the other party’s character. If he were to randomly help and allow the latter to recover, the other party might instead come and snatch the ‘Heavenly Flame’ in his body. What would he do then?</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, little fellow, you can rest assured that as long as you are able to repair the soul of the old me, the old me swear that I will not harm you in the future.” Tian Huo zun-zhe involuntarily smiled when he saw Xiao Yan deep in thought. He slowly spoke before beckoning with his hand. A snow-white storage ring from the skeleton beside him flew up and fell into his hand. With a flick of his finger, a pale-white-colored scroll appeared in front of him. Flying beasts, that were emitting flame from their bodies, were drawn on it.</p>
 <p>“This is the Dou Technique that the old me was famous for back then, the ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique.’ Ha ha, it is not quite right to describe it as a Dou Technique. It should be described as a flame controlling method.” Tian Huo zun-zhe tossed the scroll to Xiao Yan and said. “As long as you help the old me, this thing will be yours. If you doubt the sincerity of the old me, you can take the scroll first. It is not too late for you to help me repair my soul after you discover that there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan carefully received the scroll. He hesitated for a moment before cautiously pulling it open slowly.</p>
 <p>“Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique, aflame control skill. This technique is divided into five categories based on the shape of the beast: Wolf, Leopard, Lion, Tiger, Snake. Each kind of beast has its own fire spirit. Upon complete mastery of this fire technique, the five beasts can gather and form a Five Ring Flame Expelling Flame Formation. It has the enormous strength to boil the sea and burn the sky.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze swept over this somewhat simple introduction slowly. His gaze immediately paused on the last row of small words.</p>
 <p>“If four of the five beasts are agglomerated from a ‘Heavenly Flame,’ the strength of this technique is comparable to a Tian class Dou Technique!”</p>
 <p>“Tian class Dou Technique?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes stared firmly at these four words. He inhaled a cold breath of air within his heart. He had never even heard the slightest information about a Tian class Dou Technique during these many years. The highest class Dou Technique that he had come into contact with was likely the ‘God Seal Skill’ that Xun Er had given him. Even though that was the case, one must reach complete mastery in order to step into the Tian class Dou Technique entrance. Could this so-called ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique’ also possess this kind of frightening strength?</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gradually recovered his calm after his mind was shaken for awhile. He curled his lips slightly. A flame controlling technique. He had indeed not practiced one before. Normally, his control of the ‘Heavenly Flame’ to attack was quite simple. This ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique’ was indeed suitable for him. Would the part where four of the five beast being agglomerated from ‘Heavenly Flame’ mean that one required four kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames?’</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly when he thought until this moment. Currently, the interior of his body only had three kinds. He did not know just when it would be before he could reach that stage…</p>
 <p>However, even if this point was eliminated, this so-called ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique’ was really attractive to Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gently tapped the scroll on his hand. He was silent for quite awhile. Tian Huo zun-zhe did not press him. All the latter did was calmly watch Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>The silent atmosphere continued for a couple of minutes before Xiao Yan’s let out a long breath. His bright eyes glanced to Tian Huo zun-zhe as he slowly said.</p>
 <p>“I can help old mister repair his soul. However, I hope that old mister is agreeable to add another condition.”</p>
