 <p><strong><u>Chapter 1246: Soul Baby Demon Tree</u></strong></p>
 <p>The vast forest had an unusual fragrance lingering over it. A faint fog covered the forest and there would occasionally be some small beast rushing out from the grass. The peaceful atmosphere caused it to appear like paradise.</p>
 <p>“This ancient forest had already formed its own world after countless number of years of evolution. It also possess quite a number of powerful Magical Beasts. Everyone should be careful.”</p>
 <p>A couple of figures rushed over the midair before landing on a large tree. Xiao Yan’s eyes swept around him before softly issuing the reminder. He could sense that there were quite a number of powerful auras in this forest. They were clearly the Magical Beasts of this place.</p>
 <p>“Yes, quite a number of Magical Beasts here are creatures belonging to the ancient times. Their fighting strength are quite strong. It would be a little troublesome if one get entangled with them.” Tian Huo zun-zhe nodded and spoke in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“Tch. What did it matter if they are ancient creatures. Relax, everything will be fine if you follow me.” Zi Yan curled her small mouth. Her eyes swept around her before her toes pressed onto a tree branch. Her delicate small body rushed out and headed into the deep parts of the forest.</p>
 <p>“Let’s follow this girl. It will be safer following her in this place.” Xiao Yan smiled towards everyone before taking the lead to follow Zi Yan.</p>
 <p>This ancient forest was quite big. Even with the speed of Xiao Yan’s group, they were still unable to see the edge of the forest despite having shuttled for over ten minutes. From this, one could tell just how vast the remains left behind by this Dou Sheng from the ancient times was.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group had felt quite a lot of powerful auras along the way. There were even a couple of times when there were some large sized ferocious looking Magical Beast passing in front of them. However, perhaps it was because Zi Yan was an Ancient Void Dragon. That vaguely present dragon might caused these Magical Beast to avoid stepping forward and disturb their group. This had caused Xiao Yan’s group to travel smoothly.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>A couple of human figures rushed passed the forest before Xiao Yan paused his footsteps. He turned his head towards the north and frowned tightly.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Little Fairy Doctor hurriedly asked upon seeing this.</p>
 <p>“Other people have entered. Moreover, there’s quite a large number of them.” Xiao Yan said.</p>
 <p>“Looks like they have also discovered the stone door.” Little Fairy Doctor knitted her eyebrows and said.</p>
 <p>“No, they are from another direction. It looks like there are more entrances into this ancient forest than just the one we took.” Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He immediately continued, “Looks like we need to be faster.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve sensed it!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s words had just sounded when a joy suddenly surged on the little face of Zi Yan at the front.</p>
 <p>“Soul Baby Fruit?” Xiao Yan’s heart tightened as he hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, that’s no mistake. I am more familiar than you when it comes to the scent of these kind of natural treasure.” Zi Yan nodded. She did not hesitate as she pressed her toes on a tree branch and swiftly charge out. Xiao Yan’s group hurriedly followed behind her.</p>
 <p>Swoosh swoosh!</p>
 <p>The sound of rushing wind continued to appear deep within the forest. Due to them being afraid of being followed, Xiao Yan’s group had increased their speed greatly. Their group moved behind Zi Yan. Only after ten minutes did Zi Yan in front finally gently landed her body in front of a large tree. Her eyes were staring intently at the front.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan also swiftly landed. His eyes followed Zi Yan’s gaze and swept over the place. After which, it stilled. A wild joy that was difficult to hide appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>The thing that appeared in front of Xiao Yan’s group was a hundred feet large lake. The lake water within was unusually clear. However, one could not see the bottom at a glance. The middle of the lake was a small floating plot of land. It was just like a small island at the middle of a lake. On that island was an extremely strange small tree.</p>
 <p>The small tree was grayish silver in colour. Its tree branches were entwined like vines. These tree branches would form a strange arc wherever it was extended. If looked at it while standing from afar, one would discover that the shape of these plants were very much like a pregnant woman with a bulging womb. There was a golden light overflowing from the interior of the belly that was formed by the many branches.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed the Soul Baby Demon Tree…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he saw this strange shaped plant and spoke in a rejoiced manner.</p>
 <p>“What are you waiting for now that you have found it. Go and get it!” Xiong Zhan parted his mouth and laughed.</p>
 <p>“Wait, any natural spiritual objects will have some guardian Magical Beast. This Soul Baby Fruit is a unique treasure that refines a soul. It possess a great effect towards some Magical Beasts too. How is it possible for it not to have a guardian beast.” Zi Yan, however shook her head. After which, her eyes paused on the lake. Her small fist was clenched and she threw a punch. A frightening wind violently slammed onto the surface of the lack and creating an enormous hole.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>This punch had just been thrown when the calm lake surface suddenly formed a monstrous wave. Immediately, Xiao Yan’s group discovered that there was an enormous shadow swiftly surfacing from within the lake. Finally, a splash sounded and it broke out of the water. Its enormous eyes contained a fierce glint as it swept all over the place.</p>
 <p>“It is actually the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon. It has already become extinct in the outside world…” Zi Yan was involuntarily surprised when she saw the enormous Magical Beast that broke out of the water.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group also looked at this enormous being that had broke out from the water. This thing possessed a body of a snake. Its long body was covered with green scales. That body of it was extremely long, so much so that Xiao Yan’s group could only see the portion above the surface of the water. There was also a dark black long horn on its head. The long horn had some mysterious symbols and there was a blue coloured light vaguely flickering over it.</p>
 <p>Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon. This kind of Magical Beast from the ancient times was something that Xiao Yan had read about from some ancient text. During the ancient times, the fighting strength of such a Magical Beast was quite famous. It was rumoured that the body of the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon had some dragon tribe bloodline flowing within it. If it could wash and refine it as well as experience many lightning tribulations, it might perhaps be able to evolve into a true Ancient Void Dragon existence.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that we are still able to see the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon here…” Xiao Yan sighed. After which, he looked at Zi Yan. The latter nodded and said, “Leave it to me.”</p>
 <p>The strength of this Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon was around that of the peak of rank 7. However, by relying on its bloodline and physical body, it could even fight against an elite Dou Zun. Although Xiao Yan’s group could finish it off, it was naturally the best if they need not fight. Should this fellow’s beast instincts be unleashed during the battle and end up destroying the Soul Baby Fruit, they would really end up in a situation where there was nowhere for them to go crying to.</p>
 <p>Zi Yan leaped down from the tree branch and gently landed on the lake. Purple light spread out from her body and transformed into a ten feet large purple light dragon. This purple dragon roared towards the sky when it appeared.</p>
 <p>Although the purple dragon was small in size it was a genuine Ancient Void Dragon. That was the pinnacle existence within the Magical Beast world. Additionally, the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon possessed a similar bloodline to it. That kind of dragon might was obviously exceptionally intense.</p>
 <p>Under the low roar by the purple dragon, the fierceness in the eyes of the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon was also gradually withdrawn. Its enormous body slowly shrunk back into the water. That enormous head moved towards Zi Yan in an extremely gentle pet like manner.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group sighed in relief when they saw this. Zi Yan patted the head of the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon before pointing towards the Soul Baby Tree at the middle of the lake.</p>
 <p>That Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon was startled for a moment after seeing the direction that Zi Yan pointed towards. Its eyes had a human like unwillingness appearing in it. It had protected the Soul Baby Fruit for so many years. Naturally, it was unwilling to just give it to others. However, the bloodline pressure that was emitted from Zi Yan’s body caused it to be unable to resist. In an instant, it could only end up being dispirited and appeared quite pitiful.</p>
 <p>“Can we give it some compensation? It is really very pitiful.” Zi Yan’s heart softened upon seeing this manner of the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon. She turned her head and asked Xiao Yan.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure rushed down and landed beside Zi Yan. He cupped his hands towards the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon and said, “I am really sorry. Originally, I do not wish to snatch something that you like but the Soul Baby Fruit is really too important to us. This kind of unique treasure might be of great use to one’s soul but the main aspect that a Magical Beast train is the physical body. The effect of having a strong soul is not very great. I have two types of medicinal pills that possessed some refining effect towards a Magical Beast physical body. It should possess quite a great effect towards you. Additionally, your body contains the ancient dragon bloodline. There is quite a great difficult transforming into a human form. There is also a matured Body Transformation Grass…”</p>
 <p>The eyes of the Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon immediately brightened when it heard the words ‘Body Transformation Grass’. Only then did it suddenly nod its large head.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan quietly sighed in relief within his heart upon seeing this. He hurriedly took out the medicinal pills and a jade box. The Heaven Reaching Semi-Dragon sucked with its large mouth and swallowed all of them into its stomach. It was finally satisfied with this compensation. It moved its enormous body and entered the deep parts of the lake while bringing about some ripples.</p>
 <p>After gently dispatching with this large fellow, Xiao Yan waved his hand towards Zi Yan by the side. His body subsequently moved and he appeared on the island at the middle of the lake.</p>
 <p>Only when he stood beside the Soul Baby Demon Tree did Xiao Yan realise that two fist size golden fruits were hung within the pregnant woman’s belly like tree branches. The fruits appeared just like a vivid human like baby. A vaguely present fragrance spread from it, causing the soul between Xiao Yan’s brows to involuntarily tremble a little.</p>
 <p>“Quickly take the thing away. The sound of Magical Beast roar within this forest is becoming dense. It seems that quite a number of people had barge in.” Little Fairy Doctor’s group also hurried to the island in the middle and urged.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan nodded. He cut a thick Soul Baby Demon Tree branch before swiftly making a somewhat crude wooden box. This Soul Baby Fruit was extremely mysterious. It cannot be kept using any other materials. Otherwise, it would gradually vaporize. The only thing that could contain it was the tree branch of the demon tree.</p>
 <p>Upon the successful creation of a wooden box, Xiao Yan carefully cut through the many branches. After which, he cut off the two tree branches that held the Soul Baby Fruit and carefully placed them into the wooden box. He flipped his hand and kept it into his Storage Ring.</p>
 <p>“We have finally obtained the Soul Baby Fruit…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s heart appeared as though it had been relieved of a heavy stone the moment he kept the Soul Baby Fruit into his Storage Ring. He had finally completed his mission. Yao Lao would definitely be able to recover his peak strength this time around!</p>
 <p>“Let’s go…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan was planning to leave quickly after having kept the Soul Baby Fruit when he discovered that Zi Yan beside him was staring at an even deeper part of the forest in a startled manner. He became stunned as he asked, “What is it?”</p>
 <p>“There… something is summoning me.”</p>
 <p>Zi Yan’s eyes also became a little loss and blurry at this moment. That kind of feeling seemed to have originated from her bloodline.</p>
