 <p><strong><u>Chapter 871: Eliminating The Hidden Danger</u></strong></p>
 <p>The old figure stiffened for an instant before swiftly recovering. Without turning around, he continued toward the dark forest.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The old figure had just entered the gloomy forest when a sharp, cold glint suddenly flashed and appeared. It carried a dense wind that caused one’s hairs to stand as it trickily and viciously shot toward his throat.</p>
 <p>The sudden attack caught the old human figure somewhat off guard. However, it was fortunate that the figures strength was not weak. Immediately, a low cry was emitted from his mouth and the space in front of him suddenly became distorted. The cold glint’s path was altered because of the distorted air, causing it to fly past his shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?” The old human figure cried out furiously after dodging the attack. He waved his shriveled hand before suddenly clenching it. Immediately a couple of partially visible energy arcs violently grabbed at a certain spot in the dark forest.</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>Five sharp winds shot out of the old human figure’s hand-claw. They blasted apart a couple of enormous trees that were as thick as one’s thigh, causing sawdust to scatter in all directions.</p>
 <p>The old human figure’s face changed after his attack failed to hit his target. He was just about to withdraw when a white-colored figure suddenly flashed and appeared in a lightning-like manner. A gray fog that carried a slight stench came pouncing over.</p>
 <p>The old human figure had sensed something before the fog came into contact with his body. Having vast experience, he could tell at a glance that this mist contained a lethal poison. He immediately waved his sleeves. A wild, violent wind erupted from them and blew away the fog. Borrowing this obstruction, his toes pressed on the empty air and his body suddenly rose to the sky. A ‘chi’ sound was finally emitted as he broke through the dense tree branches.</p>
 <p>After having broken out of the forest, the old figure was just about to flee when his body suddenly stiffened. He raised his head. His face immediately turned ugly as he glared at the white-haired old man suspended in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Su Qian!”</p>
 <p>The old human figure turned his head slightly as a cold voice was emitted with his teeth, revealing a familiar face. This figure was surprisingly Old Ying Shan, the person who had taken the initiative to give up on the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva before.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, mister Ying Shan’s tactics are quite good. You were actually able to hide your Spiritual Strength in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Even I could barely sense it…” A soft laugh sounded from behind Old Ying Shan. The latter turned his head only to see Xiao Yan flapping his jade-green fire wings above the sea of trees.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that you actually discovered it… where is the last person? Call them out too!” Old Ying Shan coldly cried out. His expression was somewhat dark and solemn as he suddenly looked at the sea of trees under him.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The dense tree branches suddenly shook after Old Ying Shan’s voice sounded. Immediately, a graceful white-colored figure flashed out. Finally, a white dress drifted and appeared in the sky. A somewhat swift figure coincidentally sealed off Old Ying Shan’s retreat path.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, old demon, you are really cunning. If Xiao Yan were not an alchemist nor possessed a Spiritual Strength that exceeded that of an ordinary person, it is likely that he would not have sensed your spirit hiding in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.” Su Qian smiled and laughed as he observed Old Ying.</p>
 <p>“Since you had already discovered me, why did you not act earlier?” Old Ying Shan coldly laughed. When he had hidden his spirit in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, he had planned to wait for Xiao Yan and Han Feng to engage in battle. He was willing to wait for them to end up seriously injured before suddenly stealing the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva without anyone realizing. However, the final result was not as perfect as he had imagined. Xiao Yan used a lightning-like tactic to kill the three Elders from the Demon Flame Valley. Finally, he displayed the ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame,’ causing Han Feng and Mo Tian Xing to quietly fear him. The two could only withdraw. Thus, the Little Fairy Doctor and Su Qian had managed to maintain their fighting strength. Given Old Ying Shan’s strength, he might be unafraid of a one-on-one fight with either one of them, but he would certainly be defeated if he fought the two of them alone.</p>
 <p>“There were far too many people giving chase during these last two days, and I did not have the time to bother with you. Moreover, it must be said that this tactic of yours of hiding your spirit is indeed extremely unique. I could sense it, but I could not find it. After all, there are a countless number of greedy people giving chase from behind, making it impossible for me to take out the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to carefully observe it. Once we reach Jia Nan Academy and I had sufficient time to study the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, the imprint would definitely be dragged out. Therefore…”</p>
 <p>“So the reason you purposefully left by yourself was to get the old me to reveal myself!” Old Ying Shan’s face twitched. He did not expect to to fall for Xiao Yan’s scheme. The flawless plan he had come up with to hide himself had actually been discovered by Xiao Yan long ago.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. His gaze swept over Old Ying Shan’s illusionary body and laughed in a faint manner, “Mister Ying Shan, please hand the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva back to me. I can let bygones be bygones. Although you are currently only a spiritual body, if this spirit is beaten and scattered by us, it is likely that your original body will suffer quite the damage. Moreover… by relying on my senses, I might even be able to find the position of your actual body.</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan’s face slightly changed as he laughed in a faint manner, “Brat, do you really treat the old me as having been frightened while growing up? If you really wish to force me, the old me will destroy this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva right now. I will see what you can do at that time.”</p>
 <p>“This spiritual avatar skill old Mister Ying is using seems to be one that requires your actual body to remain a short distance away, no? This means that your actual body should not be far from us. If I did not sense wrongly…” Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly opened them and his finger pointed to a shadowy forest in the northern direction. He coldly laughed, “Your actual body should be in that direction, right?”</p>
 <p>Even with Old Ying Shan’s schemingness, his expression involuntarily changed when he saw where Xiao Yan had pointed. The Qi Method he practiced was extremely unique. If his spiritual avatar were to be struck and scattered, he would end up in a weakened state, and would only be able to recover after training for a period of time. However, if his actual body was found, the situation could become a fatal one.</p>
 <p>Hence, Old Ying Shan placed his actual body in an extremely hidden and safe place each time he used his Qi Method. However, that position was currently being pointed out by Xiao Yan. In other words, if the latter was allowed to search carefully, he might be able to find the exact position of Old Ying Shan’s actual body. At that time…</p>
 <p>The coldness on Xiao Yan’s face faded slightly when he saw Old Ying Shan’s changing expression under the moonlight. He softly said, “Old Mister Ying, I am respecting you as a senior of the ‘Black-Corner Region.’ That is why I did not have anyone attack you. As long as you return the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, I, Xiao Yan, guarantee that you will leave without suffering the slightest loss.”</p>
 <p>Faced with Xiao Yan’s alternating tactics of persuasion, Old Ying Shan’s changing expression had become a little better. A moment later, it gradually stabilized and he inhaled a deep breath of air. His gaze slowly swept to Su Qian and Little Fairy Doctor who were looking at him with ill intent. The sharp aura that was spreading from their bodies caused Old Ying Shan to bitterly laugh. Forget about him currently being a spiritual avatar. Even at his peak condition, it would be difficult for him to successfully flee from the hands of these two people.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed the case of the new wave replacing the old. Looks like this ‘Black-Corner Region’ is the world of the young. Forget it, consider yourself victorious. This Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva…” Old Ying Shan shook his head and sighed. He lifted the jade box in his hand slightly, and hesitated for a moment. He then clenched his teeth and tossed it over, “I’ll give it to you.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly as he looked at the jade box being thrown over. However, he did not use his hand to grab it. Instead, he flicked his finger and a hidden force surged out to receive the jade box. After which, the force controlled the box, carefully keeping it suspended in front of him.</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan’s brows were slightly knit without anyone noticing when he observed Xiao Yan’s extremely cautious manner. He immediately let out a cold cry, “Hmph, even if you obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, it is likely that you will have difficulty getting information about the Bodhisattva Heart behind it.”</p>
 <p>“My aim is not that distant and unreachable Bodhisattva Heart. Instead, it is this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.” Xiao Yan smiled slightly as he replied in a soft, gentle voice.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor’s cold but pretty face revealed a startled look when she heard Xiao Yan’s words. A touched expression flashed through her transparent eyes. She naturally knew just how much effort Xiao Yan had put in to help her control the ‘Woeful Poison Body.’ He was even willing to become enemies with these old fellows who possessed frightening strength…</p>
 <p>Although her heart was touched, the Little Fairy Doctor would naturally not reveal too much given her character. However, a gentle ripple had been created in her old-well-like heart. This caused her cold, sealed-off heart to quietly melt.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, your words sound nice. It is unexpected that the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva would end up in your hands with so many people coming to snatch it… goodbye.” Old Ying Shan curled his mouth and ceased saying any nonsense. His body shook and gradually turned illusionary. A moment later, he had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>The speed at which Old Ying Shan disappeared was extremely fast. Within a split second, his spiritual body had escaped the range of Xiao Yan’s senses, and disappeared within the endless darkness.</p>
 <p>The Little Fairy Doctor and Su Qian sighed in relief after they saw Old Ying Shan hand over the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. Their bodies moved and they appeared beside Xiao Yan. They looked at the jade box floating near him and involuntarily laughed, “We have finally gotten this old fellow to give up.”</p>
 <p>A strange smile surfaced on the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth when he heard this. He shook his head slightly and softly asked, “How could it be so easy? This old fox…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger after his words sounded. The invisible Fallen Heart Flame rose from his finger and swallowed the jade box within it.</p>
 <p>The jade box immediately turned into powder under the high temperature of the Fallen Heart Flame, revealing a life-like Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva which was slowly wiggling. Xiao Yan’s gaze drifted over and a cold smile surfaced on his face. He controlled a thread of the Fallen Heart Flame and slowly wrapped it around the latter.</p>
 <p>Following the wrapping of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, a certain portion of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva shook and threads of white smoke rose from it. A slight ‘chi chi’ sound seemed to emit a faint miserable cry…</p>
 <p>“Chi chi!”</p>
 <p>Old Ying Shan, whose spiritual body had just returned to his physical body—hidden in a cave on a cliff a thousand meters away from Xiao Yan’s group, suddenly changed his expression as Xiao Yan controlled his flame. A mouthful of fresh blood was suddenly spat from his mouth. Immediately, Old Ying Shan raised his head, and viciously glared in the direction of Xiao Yan’s group. He screamed, “Very good, what a cautious brat. The old me shall remember you!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan smiled. He placed the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva in a newly obtained jade box while he was above the sea of trees. He lazily stretched his waist and softly said, “We have finally eliminated this trouble. Now, we can calmly return to the Jia Nan Academy…”</p>
