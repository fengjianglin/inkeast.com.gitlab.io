 <p><strong><u>Chapter 955: Acquaintance</u></strong></p>
 <p>Han Lin was stunned when he saw these two pale-faced old man lying on the ground without showing any signs of being dead or alive. Shock flashed across his face when he recognized the two of them. He involuntarily cried out, “Hong Lie? Hong Mu? Why would they end up in your hands?”</p>
 <p>“They have come to stop us and capture me.” Han Xue indifferently replied.</p>
 <p>“This… this is done by him?” Han Lin’s face quivered a little as he looked at Xiao Yan with disbelief and asked in an extremely doubtful voice. Being a member of the Han clan, he was naturally extremely familiar with Hong Lie and Hong Mu. Hence, he also knew that these two fellows were genuine expert Dou Huangs. With their combined strength, these two could fight against a six star Dou Huang. Did these two people really end up defeated by the hands of this young man who appeared even younger than him?</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you think that there is someone else in our group who can do this?” Han Xue seemed to dislike Han Lin a little. Hence, her tone was not the least bit courteous.</p>
 <p>After being choked by Han Xue’s words, Han Lin’s expression alternated between green and white for a moment before forcefully suppressing the jealousy in his heart. If the elders in the clan knew that he treated an Honorary Guest of the clan in such a manner, he would definitely be punished.</p>
 <p>“Ke ke, I was reckless earlier…” Han Lin smiled somewhat unnaturally toward Xiao Yan. After which, he swiftly turned his gaze to Han Xue and said, “Xue mei, let’s go. We should return to the clan first. The clan head and the others are extremely worried.”</p>
 <p>Han Xue nodded slightly. She instructed some people to throw the unconscious Hong Mu and Hong Lie back into the carriage. After which, she swiftly turned her head to Xiao Yan and softly said, “Mister Xiao Yan, let’s go. Let me introduce the clan members to you.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly when he heard this. He really did not wish to get too involved with the matters within the Han clan. However, when he saw the pleading look in Han Xue’s eyes, he could only sigh, wave his hand, and say, “Lead the way.”</p>
 <p>A warm smile once again appeared on Han Xue’s face when she saw Xiao Yan nod his head. Her coldness seemed to have completely disappeared in front of him. This caused Han Lin by the side to burn with a furious flame within his heart. He had never seen his usually cold and indifferent cousin sister treating a man in this manner after so many years. Moreover, the thing that caused him to be cautious was that the age of this man seemed to be similar to hers.</p>
 <p>However, he did not dare to express these emotions on his face after being made aware of Xiao Yan’s strength. Hence, he could only put on a forceful smile, turn around, and led the way in front with a stomach full of fury.</p>
 <p>The Han clan did indeed possess quite a great strength and reputation within Tian Bei City. This could be seen from how they were omitted from being checked when they entered the city.</p>
 <p>The convoy slowly entered the city. A lively and noisy sound pounced onto them, causing Xiao Yan, who had stayed in the desert for quite a number of days, to find it difficult to adjust to within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>The size of Tian Bei City was not smaller than any of the cities that Xiao Yan had seen in the past. Perhaps it was because of the good planning, but the entire city had a kind of majestic atmosphere. The spacious streets had an unceasing flow of people, revealing the large number of people in the city.</p>
 <p>The Han clan was situated on the southern part of Tian Bei City. Opposite it was the Hong clan, which occupied the northern part. These two clan were like the two overlords of this city, both parties had evenly divided the city into two distinct portions…</p>
 <p>Of course, the city also possessed some other small factions. However, they were somewhat insignificant compared to the Han and Hong clan. They could only survive within the cracks. They seemed to float around while looking up at the two large beings in the city.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s group passed through the many roads and streets in the city for nearly half an hour before they slowly came to a stop in front of a courtyard that occupied an extremely vast parcel of land.</p>
 <p>When the convoy reached the entrance of the courtyard, they coincidentally saw quite a number of carriages stopping at this place. These carriages had a similar red-colored badge. Han Xue’s and Han Lin’s expression changed slightly upon seeing this scene. The latter’s expression was gloomy as he said, “People from the Hong clan? They actually dare to come to our Han clan and behave atrociously?”</p>
 <p>“Enter!”</p>
 <p>Han Xue’s pretty face had also recovered its iciness. She instructed Han Chong’s group to unload the goods on the convoy before leaping down from her horse. She then quickly walked into the manor. Behind her, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before following.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan followed Han Xue into the manor. Along the way, she met some female servants and became aware of what had happened after some inquiry. It seemed that not long after Han Lin left, the Hong clan had led some people to barge into the Han clan. Currently, both parties were entangled with each other in the Meeting Room.</p>
 <p>Han Xue increased the speed of her footsteps when she became aware of the location. She led Xiao Yan and Han Lin through various small paths before an extremely majestic-looking hall appeared in front of Xiao Yan’s eyes. Despite being quite far away, Xiao Yan was able to vaguely see the many figures that had gathered within the Meeting Room.</p>
 <p>Han Xue gently waved her hand as they approached. She led Xiao Yan to a corner where they were coincidentally able to see the interior of the Meeting Room. Her pretty eyes were focused intently on the interior of the hall.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze also followed hers and looked over. It swept once around the hall before suddenly pausing on a silver-colored bright figure. His face immediately became stunned.</p>
 <p>“Han Yue? Why would she be her? She’s a member of the Han clan? No wonder I thought Han Xue was a little familiar when I saw her. They are actually sisters…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan gained a deep impression of this senior within the Inner Academy back then. At that time, he had quietly snatched away the Core Quenching Body Milk, which she had tried to obtain with much difficulty. He had been feeling somewhat apologetic over it. However, by the time he had come out of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower two years later, Han Yue had already graduated and left. Thus, this had become regret in his heart. Unexpectedly, the first faction that he had come into contact with upon arriving in the Central Plains would be her clan. The word ‘affinity’ was really something difficult to fathom.</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>The atmosphere within the Meeting Room was quite tense. Many experts from the Hong clan had crossed their hands in front of their chests as they looked at the members of the Han clan with a cold smile. Seated at their leader’s spot was a green-clothed man. The man was around twenty-six to twenty-seven. His face could not be considered handsome, but it also possessed an allure. Between his brows was a boastful aura that was difficult to hide. However, he did possess the capital to act in this domineering manner.</p>
 <p>“Hong Chen, aren’t you going a little overboard by bringing people to barge into my Han clan today? Don’t think that you can act fearlessly just because you are a disciple of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. The reason our Han clan has stood in this Tian Bei City for so many years is not because we are trampled on by others!” A middle-aged man in brilliant clothes slowly said in the large hall. His voice was not very loud, but it possessed authority even without anger.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Han need not threaten this nephew. The reason I am here today is to ask if there is a reply to the condition that my Hong clan had mentioned a couple of days ago?” That green-clothed man, who was called Hong Chen, smiled in an unbothered manner. His gaze immediately turned to the silver-haired lady by the side whose face did not show the slightest ripple before parting his mouth and laughing.</p>
 <p>TL: the nephew is not blood related in this case. It is just a term to refer to someone of the younger generation in acquainted family.</p>
 <p>“Our Han clan does not have the custom of having two daughters waiting on one husband. Moreover, I will also not allow such a thing to happen. My Han clan will definitely not agree to the request of your Hong clan!” The middle-aged man spoke decisively.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, in that case, you should not blame our Hong clan for not taking into account our relationship!” Hearing this, Hong Chen’s face also appeared gloomy as he replied with a cold smile.</p>
 <p>“Even if my Han clan cannot be compared with your Hong clan, I dare to say that if your Hong clan wishes to swallow my Han clan, you will definitely suffer a serious loss!” The middle-aged man stared at Hong Chen in a dense manner as he slowly spoke.</p>
 <p>Hong Chen once again coldly laughed. He stood up and randomly said, “Perhaps uncle Han is unaware that this nephew has recently formally become the Inner Hall disciple of the Wind Lightning Pavilion.”</p>
 <p>Hong Chen’s words appeared like a heavy bomb, which had been thrown into the hall. Not only did everyone expressions greatly change, but even the usually expressionless Han Yue also twitched her long eyelashes.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man’s eyes became gloomier. Under this gloominess was also a bitterness. He did not expect that this Hong Chen would actually be able to become an Inner Hall disciple of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Therefore, the authority he had to speak within the Wind Lightning Pavilion would be increased quite significantly, and the influence of the Hong clan would greatly expand…</p>
 <p>“On account of the Han clan once having some relationship with the Hong clan, I can give your Han clan a path. As long as your Han clan can find someone in the same generation, regardless of whether the person is from the Han clan, to defeat me on the Sky Stone Stage in the city three days from now, my Hong clan will not find trouble with your Han clan for ten years. Of course, if you lose, Han Xue and Han Yue will be mine! What do you say?” Hong Chen laughed out loud and immediately spoke when he saw the faces of the members of the Han clan drastically change.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man and some elders of the Han clan involuntarily changed their expressions when they heard this. Although the words of this Hong Chen were arrogant, his training talent was indeed exceptional. Otherwise, he would not have been picked by the Wind Lightning Pavilion. His current strength was likely around that of a seven or eight star Dou Huang. Among the same generation, who was a match for him? This competition was basically one used to bully others… however, if they did not accept the match, it was likely that the Hong clan would use the physical force method. If the Wind Lightning Pavilion were to intervene at that time, the Han clan… would really have difficulty escaping this calamity…</p>
 <p>Silence continued for a long time within the hall. Finally, it was broken by a chilly voice.</p>
 <p>“Alright, my Han clan will accept the challenge. However, if we lose, I will marry you, but my sister won’t!”</p>
 <p>Hong Chen suddenly raised his head. His eyes were heated as he looked at the silver-haired Han Xue. A moment later, he laughed out loud, “Alright, we will do as you say. It is fine if I marry the elder sister first! Since this is the case, Hong Chen shall bid everyone goodbye for today. We will meet on the Sky Stone Stage three days later!”</p>
 <p>Hong Chen waved his hand after his words sounded. After which, he led the large group and swarmed out. Finally, they swiftly disappeared outside of the courtyard.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere within the hall was still quiet as everyone watched Hong Chen leave. A moment later, the middle-aged man finally sighed softly and said, “Yue-er, do you have the confidence?”</p>
 <p>“No…” Han Yue tightened her hand. She inhaled a breath of air and said, “However, is there any other method than this? In the Tian Bei City, there are hardly anyone in the same generation who could advance to the Dou Huang class. Those who could contend with Hong Chen basically do not exist. They are pushing our Han clan to the path of death. Only by doing this will we be able to gain some time to breathe…”</p>
 <p>“Who says? I have a better choice!”</p>
 <p>Han Yue’s voice had just sounded when a clear alluring voice was transmitted from outside of the hall. Everyone raised their heads and saw Han Xue running in. All of them rejoiced.</p>
 <p>“Girl, you are finally back… however, there is no need for you to randomly get involved in the matter here.” The middle-aged man looked at Han Xue, gave her a doting smile before waving his hand. Hong Chen naturally had quite a lot of confidence for him to say those things. He had difficulty finding an opponent among the same generation within Tian Bei City. How would there be a more suitable choice for the Han clan then Han Yue?</p>
 <p>Han Xue did not explain more in the face of the middle-aged man’s words. She turned around, faced outside, and said, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the hall involuntarily raised their heads with surprise when they saw her actions. Some muttering noises also sounded within their hearts as their gazes were thrown out of the hall. Did this girl really have a better choice?</p>
 <p>A moment later, a linen-clothed, young man wore a helpless expression as he slowly entered the room in front of everyone’s eyes. His gaze paused on Han Yue, who had suddenly stood up upon seeing him. He dryly laughed, “Senior Han Yue, it has been a couple of years since we last met. How are you…”</p>
