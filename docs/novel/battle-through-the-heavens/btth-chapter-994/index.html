 <p><strong><u>Chapter 994: Black Clothed Man</u></strong></p>
 <p>“Xiao Yan? He is the Xiao Yan who killed Chen Yun?”</p>
 <p>Numerous stunned gazes were looking at the young man a short distance away within a forest that was permeated by fog. The name Xiao Yan had been spread wildly during this period of time. It was rare that someone from the younger generation could force an expert like Fei Tian to personally act. Moreover, the thing that was even more shocking was that this person was able to escape from Fei Tian’s hands. This really stunned many people. There was hardly anyone within the northern region of the Central Plains who did not know just how terrifying that old demon Fei Tian was.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan eyebrows merely knit together in the face of the many gazes that contained various emotions from around him. His arm shook and the colorful satin in his hand was shot back before it was withdrawn into the sleeves of the colorfully dressed lady.</p>
 <p>“You can walk your own path and I will take my own route. If you don’t disturb me, I will also not attack you…” Xiao Yan stared at the colorfully dressed lady as he slowly spoke. He could sense that the strength of this lady was quite great. Moreover, had been picked as the most probable candidate for the position of the next Wind Lightning Pavilion’s leader. Xiao Yan definitely did not believe that she did not possess any skill. Currently, Xiao Yan’s aim was to become one of those ten names. Thus, he did not want to engage in a direct conflict with her. Naturally, he did not wish to waste his efforts right from the start.</p>
 <p>“What an arrogant tone… I will also not attack you now. I will wait for you at the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. If you have the qualifications to reach that place, we will settle the grudge that you and the Wind Lightning Pavilion possess.” The colorful-clothed lady’s pretty eyes looked at Xiao Yan as she softly laughed. Her laughter contained a coldness.</p>
 <p>“Of course, if you have been defeated before you even reach the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, it will only mean that all the things that you have accomplished are due to you borrowing the strength of others.”</p>
 <p>The colorful-clothed lady pressed her toes on the ground after her voice sounded. Her body was like a dancing butterfly. She pulled back with a flash before swiftly disappearing into the thick fog.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan laughed coldly in his heart when he saw the colorful-clothed lady withdraw. His gaze swept all around him as he slowly walked in another direction. A moment later, he disappeared within the fog in front of many gazes.</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity that they did not actually fight. I wonder just who would be stronger if the two of them were to really exchange blows?” The surrounding crowd inevitably became disappointed after watching these two people take separate routes, leaving upon meeting each other.</p>
 <p>“Hee hee, they are not fighting now because they wish to preserve some strength. There are many powerful Magical Beast within the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. The surroundings of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool are extremely concentrated with them. If one wishes to charge through this Magical Beast crowd and arrive at the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool without having some ability, it is likely that the person is only courting death for no reason. However, these two people will definitely engage in a fierce fight once they arrive at their destination.”</p>
 <p>Everyone began to head their own way after the private conversations persisted for a short while. Some of them were alone while others were in groups. After which, all of them entered the mountain range. Due to the interior of the mountain range possessing a dense energy fog, the effect obtained from possessing a map was also limited. Some people could only rely on their luck to search, testing to see if their luck was any good.</p>
 <p>The quiet mountain range had gradually become lively as everyone spread out. An unknown number of people had entered the Heaven Eye Mountain Range this time around. This large number of people had caused this mountain range, which was renowned for its many Magical Beasts, to become filled with energy. Of course, there was a hidden danger amid this liveliness.</p>
 <p>However, danger and reward coexisted together. There were many Magical Beasts in the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. Adding this onto the unusually dense energy, these mountains did not lack natural treasures. If one was lucky enough to find something, it was likely that one would have gained a lot even without being one of the ten people to enter the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool.</p>
 <p>On the whole, the Heaven Eye Mountain Range might be filled with danger, but it could also be considered a treasure mountain. As long as one possessed sufficient luck and ability, it was not difficult to return with many rewards…</p>
 <p>…..</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure flashed and appeared within the forest that was permeated by fog. His gaze swept around him as he frowned. This fog was blended with energy that could not be expelled. It greatly hindered one’s sight. A person was just like a headless housefly within it, repeatedly running around in a random manner.</p>
 <p>“The map is completely useless. The only thing that I know is that the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is located in the deep regions of the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. However, how long will it take to reach the deep region if I continue to randomly roam around?” Xiao Yan paused his footsteps and mused for a moment. His body suddenly leaped and appeared on the top of a tree branch. His eyes swept around before he swiftly leaped up. A moment later, he finally appeared on the top of a tree.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan stood at the treetop and swept his eyes around only to be stunned to realize that the fog on it was even denser. His gaze was unable to see anything even if it was less than ten meters from him. Xiao Yan raised his head and looked up. He involuntarily pulled his neck in upon doing so because an enormous colorful energy tide was spreading out from above. A wave of energy pressure that could not be resisted spread out, causing one to feel afraid.</p>
 <p>“I cannot use old mister Yao’s strength within the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. Otherwise, the effect would be unpredictable. Hence, I can only rely on myself…” Xiao Yan softly sighed. He knew that the Miss Feng was definitely clearly aware of the route to reach the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. With the ability of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, they should be quite familiar with this Heaven Eye Mountain Range. The problem of the fog should have long been expected by them. Hence, she was able to rush to the destination without any fear and save the time wasted on other routes.</p>
 <p>Since the Wind Lightning Pavilion had a clear route, the other factions like the Ten Thousand Sword Pavilion and some of the weaker factions would likely have also made preparations. Thus, it was likely that their numbers would exceed ten. Xiao Yan was quite far behind them on just this first step.</p>
 <p>“It is good to possess a faction behind one… the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool will appear one day after the energy tide appears. In other words, I must reach that place within one day. Otherwise, I will not have the blessing of enjoying the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan bitterly laughed. He mused for a moment before he suddenly sat down with his legs crossed. His Spiritual Perception swiftly spread from between his brows…</p>
 <p>Although Xiao Yan was unaware of the exact location of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, it was likely that the formation of this unique blood pool, in the middle of the mountain range, would require an unusually great amount of pure energy. In other words, the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool would be the region with the most powerful energy in the entire mountain range. Xiao Yan’s spiritual perception could use this as a medium to search. As long as he locked onto the area with the densest energy and go all out to rush there, it was likely that nothing would go wrong.</p>
 <p>Following the swift spread of Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Perception, the traces of energy ripple within a five kilometer radius was clearly reflected into Xiao Yan’s mind. The direction in which the energy flow was also gradually grasped by Xiao Yan…</p>
 <p>“The north huh…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s tightly shut eyes were suddenly opened around half an hour later. His gaze suddenly turned to the north. From his perception, this mountain range’s energy seemed to be faintly gathering in that direction.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan leaped forward after locking onto a position. He came down from the tree and landed gently onto the ground, shocking a person who was coincidentally present in this spot. As the person hurriedly stepped back, the weapon in their hand emitted a ‘clang’ sound as it was being drawn.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan ignored this fellow who appeared extremely frightening. His toes pressed on the ground and his body transformed into a black figure which charged into the dense fog in a lightning-like manner. After which, he rapidly traveled through the forest, hurrying over to the energy gathering spot located by his Spiritual Perception at his fastest speed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan discovered quite a number of people being pestered by Magical Beast along the way. They were engaged in intense fights. However, he did not stop. His figure shifted past in a ghost-like manner. With the help of his outstanding Spiritual Perception, he was able to sense if there was any hidden Magical Beasts within the dense fog one step ahead of the others. Hence, he had avoided being blocked by Magical Beast during his travel. His advancement speed was so quick that it was frightening.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan used this fierce and swift speed to advance for an hour before he gradually slowed down a little. Following his gradual entrance into the deep regions of the mountain range, the strength of the Magical Beasts hidden within the dense fog also seemed stronger. He would definitely attract the Magical Beasts over if he continued to fearlessly advance. Although Xiao Yan was not afraid, he really did not wish to end up slowing down because of them.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s toes pressed on a tree branch and his figure agily rushed forward. His eyes carefully swept all around him, and he did not create even the slightest sound when he landed on the ground, appearing just like a ghost.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s figure once again leaped onto an enormous tree. He was just about to charge forward when his heart moved. His gaze looked toward a spot not far in front of him. A human and a beast were fighting at that spot.</p>
 <p>When he saw the large Magical Beast, Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes a little. He was a little startled in his heart as he said, “It is actually a rank 6 Magical Beast?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s gaze paused on the Magical Beast. After which, it turned to the human figure facing the beast. Anyone who could reach this place at this time was definitely not an ordinary person. The person in front of him was likely not an exception.</p>
 <p>The human figure was wearing light-black clothes and looked quite young. His face was cold and he was carrying a large blue sword on his back. There was a sharp sword aura vaguely being emitted from it. From the looks of the scars around him, it was likely that this person had already exchanged blows with this rank 6 Magical Beast. However, his clothes still remained clean. Clearly, he was not at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>The black-clothed man’s face moved slightly when Xiao Yan arrived at this place. His hand slowly grabbed the sword hilt on his back and his footsteps gently shifted. Immediately, he rushed forward.</p>
 <p>Seeing the actions of the black-clothed man, the rank 6 Magical Beast emitted a roar. It moved its four legs and viciously pounced toward him.</p>
 <p>“Chi!”</p>
 <p>The man and beast crossed each other in a lightning-like manner. A sword glow was emitted in a fleeting manner.</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The black-clothed man stood straight and the longsword in his hand was slowly inserted into the scabbard behind him. The large Magical Beast had collapsed on the ground.</p>
 <p>“What a fast sword movement…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly. With his eyesight, he was only able to vaguely see the black-clothed young man drawing the sword. This person was quite powerful.</p>
 <p>“Have you seen enough?”</p>
 <p>The black-clothed man slowly raised his head while Xiao Yan was stunned in his heart. After which, his gaze shot toward Xiao Yan as he asked with a faint voice.</p>
