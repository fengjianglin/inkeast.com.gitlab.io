 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Some people say that this place is like the netherworld, that we’re akin to those demon servants working in King of Hell’s Palace. Such nonsense! This is clearly a load of nonsense! This is irresponsible slander from people who do not understand us! These kind of prejudices and misunderstandings, these unfounded criticisms, are the ones that force us to undertake our tasks in grief! This is what makes the most loyal and dutiful of us lament in despair!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who had just spoken was dressed in the light blue uniform worn by yamen runners<a href="#1"><sup>[1][2]</sup></a></span><span style>. He was wearing a conspicuous hat made of varnished cloth that was somewhat bigger than his head. His waist was wrapped with an old-fashioned red woven girdle. As for footwear, he was wearing ill-fitting white socks with black long boots. That way of dressing clearly indicated that he was just a jailer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was standing inside Peking’s Ministry of Justice Prison District&nbsp;One, Black Word, where daylight never reached the ground. He had just closed a prison cell door after some criminal officials. His tone and appearance as humble as one of those associates trying to rope in more business for the “Flushed with Success” restaurant, he only missed a towel around his shoulders meant to wipe off sweat to complete the image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very young, barely at the age where a youth becomes a young man. He was neither tall nor short, with an average figure and appearance. Yet, arched eyebrows highlighted a pair of exceptionally clever eyes. Most of all, he had well defined lips that shaped his mouth in a manner similar to a water caltrop, causing a canine to slightly poke out from between his red lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His laugh was limpid like flowing water, warm and kind like a maiden. “My surname is Ye, called Ye Xiaotian. I’ve been hanging out in this prison since I was three. I was 16 years old the year I officially took my dad’s place and became a guard at this Prison District One, Black Word. Today, it’s already the 8th year of Wanli Reign.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</sup></span><span style>Taking everything into account, I’ve been working for the emperor for three years now. Thanks to the acknowledgement of the lord managing the prison, I stand here as the acting chief of this maximum security prison nowadays. I, Xiaotian, have a pure and good character…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian was just about to blow his own trumpet when a jailer in his thirties quickly walked next to him and reported something in a low voice next to his ear. “Chief, someone is causing trouble, saying things like our meals are coarse, the bedding too damp, you see…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian slightly bent his head and asked in a low voice, “Which blind bastard is this? What kind of place does he think this is for him to still act unbridled?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The jailer replied in a low voice, “It’s the former Supreme Court Junior Government Office Deputy, Guan Yun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Ye Xiaotian inquired, “Did you check his background?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style>The old jailer replied, “He’s guilty of corruption and pilfered 50,000 taels of silvers. The Grand Secretary personally agreed to his arrest. Those behind him have also been arrested with no hope of being released.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian nodded and glanced surreptitiously at the two criminals who had just been imprisoned out of the corner of his eye. He still wore a smiling expression, a smile that could be considered even more elegant than those of many young girls. From his mouth, well-framed by thin lips, came a low voice that was only heard by the jailer standing besides him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This group of corrupted officials born with no assholes! During old man Hongwu’s reign<a href="#3"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, 60 taels of silver was enough reason to peel off a criminal’s skin. He thinks he can make demands nowadays after embezzling 50,000 taels of silver? Is this prison a place where he can enjoy his retirement? This is really giving him face. Since he dislikes sleeping on an uncomfortable bed, then send him to that empty cell in the farthest corner of the prison and give him a bundle of straw that pigs sleep on. Give him only a bowl of fresh water per day. It’s alright as long as he’s hungry but doesn’t die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The jailer anxiously replied, “Chief, what should we do if he can’t take it and tries to commit suicide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian sneered, “Someone who is fussy even in a place like this would never be willing to die. You don’t need to beat or verbally abuse him. It’ll be enough if you just ignore him. When he submits, make him clean the chamber pots for a month as punishment. I don’t believe I won’t be able to curb him after this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The jailer gave a shady smile. He accepted the order and left right after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian quietly sighed. As he faced all those criminal officials who had just arrived, he showed a smile that felt like a gentle spring breeze, and spoke in a compassionate and amiable voice, “Everyone, you’re all high ranking dignified officials, wearing jade and brocade clothes and eating fine food. Although you have fallen, you are still great nobles. I, Xiaotian, will do my utmost to take care of you and make all of you feel at home inside my prison district, Black Word.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was done speaking, he greeted them with his clasped hands and a smiling face. From his expression to his posture, at a glance, it looked like he was striking a pose on stage, as if he was taking into consideration every single one of his “spectators”. When he was done, he marched out, his appearance and bearing similar to a dignified patriarch patrolling his family compound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>　　※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ministry of Justice prison, commonly called the Celestial Prison, was divided into four prison districts: Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow. Black Word was a prison district that looked after those officials sent to prison by Brother “</span><i style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ka-ching!</i><span style>”. The great majority of them were fat, greasy and rubbish masters. Therefore, the Black Word sector in the Celestial Prison was a place for those whose crimes were just ill-gotten gains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this place for imprisoning officials had a distinctly different flavor than a normal prison. One could be held prisoner today, but tomorrow could be restored to their official post. As such, even if they were sent to prison, as someone who were once officials, their treatment were not the same as ordinary convicts. If any one of them wanted to commit suicide or mutilate themselves, the jailers would have bad luck as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if the jailers blindly indulged the prisoners, endured their tyrannical abuse, or even colluded with them and gave them information, the jailers would still suffer. What was difficult for the jailers was also a problem to the Celestial Prison Head Jailer who needed every trick in the book as well as the requisite ability to deal with such a group of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian was sixteen when he’d taken up his old man’s post. Thus, he became a jailer in Prison District One, Black Word. After barely three years of effort, he was promoted to Prison Chief. His methods were clearly uncommon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ordinarily, when new guilty officials came in, other jailers would report the situation to Ye Xiaotian. There was no need for Ye Xiaotian to appear personally. However, two months prior, the Censor-in-chief,<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a>&nbsp;</sup></span><span style>Liu Fenghui, had petitioned the Emperor, censuring the Head of the Ministry of Revenue for misconduct and embezzlement of the treasury, which then had caused two calamities. The first calamity was the imposition of forced labor on the commoners by the county head magistrates. The second calamity was the subsequent thievery by the nobles. Robbing the commoners and taking advantage of them causing the disparity between the poor and the wealthy to widen further. Under such tyranny, the common people could only bitterly endure without a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wanli Emperor took the contents of the petition very seriously. He immediately handed down an imperial edict ordering a strict and secretive investigation inside the Ministry of Revenue’s office and the treasury in preparation for a clean-up operation. He also sealed off any rumors from spreading as to lessen the burden on the common people. At the same time, he also ordered the three judicial chief ministries<sup><a href="#5">[6]</a>&nbsp;</sup></span><span style>to strictly investigate any officials, nobles and their relatives who were harming the common people and doing illegal activities. As a result, the Celestial Prison had suddenly became crowded when more than ten offending officials were sent behind bars. Ye Xiaotian took the situation very seriously. This was why he’d put in a personal appearance and had come to take care of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother, that book of western astrology you brought last time, this old man has earnestly studied it. It gave me great insights. Come here, come here! Let this old man read your fortune.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian was about to leave when he suddenly heard a voice greeting him from the next prison cell. At the same time, an arm that resembled a dried up branch stretched out from between the wooden fences that made up the prison door and walls and waved at him enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prison’s wooden fences were made of thick, circular logs. The new paint on it was peeling off at some places, revealing layers upon layers of chapped old paint. This sight was a silent testament of how long these aged wooden fences stood. The fence posts were driven into the ground a hand's width apart, allowing any offending official with a thin face to pass their head through without effort. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The prisoner appeared to be an old man with sunken cheeks, attired in a very dirty and completely wrinkled prisoner uniform whose original color could no longer be determined. He would have been completely bald if it wasn’t for the few sparse white and gray hairs that were still tenaciously standing, rooted on his red scalp like wild grass rising from the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bald old man was Yang Lin, once the Ministry of Appointments’ Minister of Foreign Affairs whose responsibility was to manage officials. At the time, it could even be said that if he wanted wind, he would have wind. If he wanted rain, he would receive rain. Unfortunately, even after three years, there was still no verdict for his crimes, since</span><span style> he implicated some important people behind the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Yang Lin was always obsessed with mystical arts. When he was a official, he didn’t have much time to research the subject, but during these three years in the prison, he was quite idle and passed his days researching the Book of Changes<a href="#7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and <em>Guiguzi</em><a href="#7"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. As he kept studying these mysterious things, he became more and more engrossed to the point where his mental state grew deranged, earning himself the nickname “The Illuminated One”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang, the Illuminated One, always put into practice what he learned, so he was always in search of someone to test out his skill. No jailers nor offending officials were interested in coping with his babbling nonsense. Therefore, his sole testing volunteer was Ye Xiaotian. At this point, he had tried bone reading, trigram divining, face reading, fortune telling based on Ye Xiaotian’s date and time of birth, and many more… In fact, Ye Xiaotian’s whole body was subjected to his tests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian was also not very convinced by Yang’s babbling nonsense, but he still made an expression full of interest as he squatted in front of Yang Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case something was to happen to the offending officials, especially those who had yet to be sentenced, as the prison chief, he would inevitably have to bear the consequences since they were his responsibility. Therefore, Ye Xiaotian was always racking his brain to give the prisoners a reason to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Lin was already doomed, he would never escape from this prison. His death was preordained, and at this point, only a question of when. His fate depended on the outcome of the battles between the top brass in the imperial court. Ever since it was certain that he would not escape the charges placed on him, his family no longer came to visit him, as if there were no more feelings of love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For those kind of people, to be mistreated in such a way by their closed ones would only hasten their early demise. Good wine and good tea alone wouldn’t urge him to keep on living. Fortunately, Yang, the Illuminated One, loved to research the occult. Thus, Ye Xiaotian simply followed Yang’s desires and gathered many specialised books on the subject for him. Nowadays, Yang Lin was completely obsessed with the occult, in large part thanks to Ye Xiaotian’s efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian squatted in front of the prison door acting as if he was in high spirits. He asked, “Lord Yang, did you gain something through your research? Haha! As expected, you’re a very able person. I heard the western missionaries said that their astrology is based on the movements of the Sun, which is something very difficult for us Easterners to clearly comprehend and learn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Lin smoothed out his sparse beard and proudly declared, “My knowledge is extremely profound. That insignificant astrology theory from the West is far lacking compared to the methods in my country’s Book of Changes. What could not be understood! Come here, come here! Quickly tell me your date, month, hour and year of birth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian cooperated with the man and told him the information he wanted. Yang, the Illuminated One, immediately sank into contemplation before saying, “</span><i><span style>Oh!</span></i><span style> So let me convert this to the western calendar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Lin started to calculate something using his fingers and mumble for a long time. Suddenly his expression shook as he exclaimed, “I’ve got it! You! According to your birth time, your astrological sign should be a Gemini. People born under the signs of Gemini are all very clever and quick-witted. They have a dual nature similar to the two opposites in Yin and Yang, mutually in constant ebb and rise. Kindhearted as well as wicked; happy but also melancholic; gentle not without ruthlessness, everything combined into a whole. </span><i><span style>Ah…</span></i><span style> such intricacy, and true complexity…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Lin ended his speech on those words while constantly shaking his bald head. Acting like a good listener, Ye Xiaotian seized the opportune moment to ask a question, “In that case, may I ask what my fate will be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, an extremely courteous and sonorous voice was heard from the next prison cell, “Little Ye…” Ye Xiaotian hurriedly waved his hand to interrupt Yang Lin and like a door to door salesman, he put the eager attitude he previously had and beamed a smile as he spoke, “Assistant Minister Huang, I don’t know what instructions you have for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Assistant Minister Huang took out some silvers and passed it through the fences of the prison cell. He calmly spoke, “I would inconvenience Leader Ye to buy one soy-braised pork shoulder from Tian Fu Hao in my stead. Tell the butcher I want them to be cut in thin slices. Also buy me one roast chicken soaked in spices. It has to be fresh out of the oven. As for the wine… It has to be Shaoxing Yellow Wine, five years or older.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! Wait for just a moment, I’ll return right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Xiaotian took the pieces of silver and estimated their weight with his hand. After he let someone go buy the meat and wine for Assistant Minister Huang, there was still quite a lot of money left. He didn’t expected that at the end of his shift today he would be able to make some profit. As he left, his footsteps were lighthearted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keeping watch of Black Word, Prison District One, a courtyard house surrounded by tall walls; dealing with fallen officials one after another, keeping watch on them, intimidating them, coaxing them, deceiving them, and even earning a bit of money on the side, this was Ye Xiaotian’s happy everyday life. He believed that this kind of “good day” would always continue, but he never expected that this would be his last day at the Celestial Prison.</span></p>

They are separates into different tasks and ranks. The color of their uniform differ following their tasks. Only in the Ming Dynasty,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;<em>zaoli</em> with blue uniform as described in the chapter. Other names that could be used for&nbsp;<em>zaoli</em> are <em>yayi&nbsp;</em>(衙役),&nbsp;<em>chaiyi</em>&nbsp;(差役) or yamen runner. They are usually employed for various odd-jobs from sedan bearers, door guards, secretary to policemen and jailers. The common point is they work in a yamen. In other words, they are the government's servants. <a href="https://ss2.sinaimg.cn/large/669fb864td0890ddd1121&amp;690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's the MC uniform.</a> Click<a href="http://www.yamenrunner.com/runner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here </a>and <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=yamen+runners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HbdkarlP05&amp;sig=hRsY3KrAHa-A1eIRkzTUvKJGz5E&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvi837_brRAhWl2YMKHe0HD-0Q6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=yamen%20runners&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>(It's optional, but this link will be useful to understand better the next chapter) for more informations.</p>

 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="3"></a>[3] What is "The 8th year of Wanli Reign"? It's the 8th year since Wanli Emperor suceeded to Longqing Emperor. This is the simple explanation. If you want the more detailed explanations, keep reading.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">In Ancient China, they&nbsp;use the Chinese era name&nbsp;to number the years following the regnal year, regnal period or regnal title of the reigning emperor, which is completely independent from the calendar systems (yes, it's in plural and I'm not getting into this for now.). It also mean that you could have different Chinese era name at the same time and, during an emperor's reign, he could also change the era name as he deemed fit. The good thing is during the Ming and Qing Dynasty, most emperors will only use one era name. For more infos, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_era_name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Now, where in the timeline this story is situated. To start with, Wanli Reign meant, it's during the reign era of Emperor Shenzong, more known as Wanli Emperor, who is a descendant of Hongwu Emperor which is the founder of the Great Ming Dynasty. In other words, we're at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty's declined. If you converted that into gregorian calendar, <strong>the story is taking place in 1580</strong> which is like around 200 years after the fall of the Yuan Dynasty (Mongol Dynasty). The retreat of the Mongols to the North caused the decline and disintegration of the Silk Road around that time, forcing the Europeans into the Age of Discovery. Years later, 1523, the first Europeans set foot on the coast of China again through maritime routes and, in 1557, the Portuguese settlement in Macau created the first European maritime trade post. (I like it when History is put together into a single piece of World History.)</p>

 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="5"></a>[5] The Censorate are high ranking officials who inspected other officials and impeached to the Emperor if there is fault or if the&nbsp;officials act without morals or virtues. They are the eyes and ears of the Emperor. For more informations, <a href="http://totallyhistory.com/ming-dynasty-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">[6] The three judicial ministries&nbsp;is called like this because it's a team composed of the Grand Court of Revision, the Censorate and the Ministry of Justice. The Emperor would usually summoned the three judicial ministries for a joint investigation when there is a very big case that needs to be resolved.

 <p style="text-align: justify;"><a name="7"></a>[7] The Book of Changes or the Yijing is a book of divination lore. It's also the oldest book of the Chinese Classics. I won't go too much in details because it's super complicate and besides, we're going to have more footnotes on divination next chapter.
