 <p>The security guy told me that the boss apparently worked in the jewelry business. He dealt with imported goods from Thailand.</p>
 <p>That villa was the place the married couple used to live in. They were out traveling most of the time, only spending a month or two in that villa while staying in Thailand for the rest of the year.</p>
 <p>It was true that Thai jewelry were famous worldwide. However, I also knew there were businessmen who would often use jewelry imports as a cover for their dirty deals.</p>
 <p>Thailand was well known to have several national treasures, including shemales, temples, elephants, and Buddhist amulets. Amongst those, the amulets were queer items!</p>
 <p>According to legend, these amulets were made of dead people’s former possessions. Sometimes, they included corpse oil. Amulets were believed to keep people safe, while some served as an aid to get rich or promoted.</p>
 <p>However, they could also kill people, destroy their families or bring continuous bad luck.</p>
 <p>They belonged to the superstition category. Technically, China didn’t allow for such items to be imported. That was why amulet traders had often pretended to import small items in order to smuggle their amulets along with them. Then, they would distribute or sell the amulets in the mainland.</p>
 <p>The mistress provoked some really big trouble if the previous owner was involved in that shady business! The Thais used all sorts of Yin materials taken from the graves to create those amulets, and it would be hard for me to deal with them as I was just an otherworldly merchant.</p>
 <p>Foreign monks could recite or chant Buddhist scriptures to take care of them, but I was a local expert. I wasn’t very adept at dealing with foreign sorcery.</p>
 <p>People outside the profession would have a hard time getting the knack of it. Thai monks would definitely know how to deal with amulets, but it wasn’t the same for me.</p>
 <p>The mistress was enraged when I told her about my discovery. She said, “I must find the previous owner to deal with him! That vicious bastard! I want to see him face to face!”</p>
 <p>I smiled. “Well, since it’s about dealing with someone face to face, how about using your husband’s power to kill him? Anyway, this is beyond my capacity. You ought to find a Thai master, since this is related to Thai sorcery. I’m sorry but I can’t help you.”</p>
 <p>However, the mistress became even angrier. She almost hit my nose while pointing at me. “If you walk away, I will tell my husband to put you in jail!”</p>
 <p>I was also enraged, and I hated that I couldn’t just slap her silly.</p>
 <p><em>Why is this woman acting like a mad dog, biting anyone she sees?!</em></p>
 <p>I dropped all pretense at this point. “Go ahead and arrest me! Do you think I can’t make ghosts pester you day and night?!”</p>
 <p>The mistress sneered. “Master Zhang, mind your words. You’ve seen my body and you’ve even touched me. Now you want to run away? How about letting my husband know about this…?”</p>
 <p>My heart sank to my feet after I heard what she had to say.</p>
 <p>The grain pouch had affected my mind at that time, and she had me by the tail because of it! If she spread this information, let alone my reputation getting destroyed, I might spend the rest of my life in jail if she sued me for rape.</p>
 <p>Helplessly, I could only agree.</p>
 <p>I asked her to contact the former owner. It would be for the best if we could solve the matter peacefully.</p>
 <p>The security guy told me that the previous owner was most likely in Thailand at the moment. This season was the busiest of the year for his kind of trade. He wouldn’t return to his old house in the meantime.</p>
 <p>I suddenly had an idea. Thai amulets used Yin materials to attract ghosts. Given its characteristics, an amulet was similar to an otherworldly item.</p>
 <p><em>Could the tricks I use to deal with otherworldly items work with Thai amulets as well?</em></p>
 <p>That thought had strangely stirred me up. It felt as if I had just grabbed onto a blade of grass that could save my life in a shoreless sea. I wanted to implement my idea so I asked Li Mazi to accompany me to buy some stuff.</p>
 <p>However, the mistress told me to first go upstairs with her. She needed to prepare some clothes to use at the hotel that night. She was scared and unwilling to go up there alone.</p>
 <p>I hesitated, but in the end I had to give Li Mazi the list of items I wanted to buy. I would stay and keep the mistress company while she collected her things.</p>
 <p>Her room was a little dark and cool when I entered.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know if it was some sort of psychological effect, or whether there was something wrong with the room.</p>
 <p>The mistress was by the closet, choosing her clothes. Since I was free, I sat down nearby and lit up a cigarette.</p>
 <p>However, I felt something strange. It was as if someone was blowing air in my ear, but there was nobody when I turned around to see.</p>
 <p><em>This atmosphere is not normal!</em></p>
 <p>I shivered and urged the mistress to hurry up. I didn’t have any useful items on hand, in case we bumped into some evil spirit; I wouldn't have the slightest bit of strength to resist.</p>
 <p>The mistress agreed and hurried up.</p>
 <p>Also, when I felt that strange puff of air, I couldn’t help but feel a heat burning inside me. My entire body began to sweat. Images started to appear in my head. All of them showed the mistress in different seductive poses.</p>
 <p>A voice spoke inside my head. <em>“What are you thinking about? No need to think. Just go. She asked you to go upstairs with her for a reason, right?”&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>“She actually likes you. She wants a baby but her man can’t do that. You’re the best choice.”</em></p>
 <p>That voice was instigating my desire. I got up, unable to control myself; my eyes were on fire as I gazed at her. She was wearing a loose, short shirt, and her bum was up in the air while she was searching for things around the room. Then, she took out a set of lingerie from her closet.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t control myself anymore. My consciousness was a blur and I jumped toward the woman uncontrollably. Then, I pressed her soft body on the bed.</p>
 <p>The mistress was scared, shrieking and trying to escape.</p>
 <p>How could I give her a chance? I used more force to make her stay still.</p>
 <p>She stopped wiggling after that. She closed her eyes, talking excitedly. “Hurry up… Don’t let your friend find out.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t have the time to think and started to undress myself.</p>
 <p>However, I had yet to do anything when someone knocked on the door. Li Mazi’s voice was heard coming from the other side. “Open the door, Little Brother Zhang. You asked me to buy a lot of things but you didn’t give me money!”</p>
 <p>My excitement died out instantly. My head was cleared after hearing Li Mazi’s voice and recalling his perverted look. I didn’t hesitate and released the woman. “I’m so sorry. I’ve been pestered by some evil things these days. Sometimes, I lose control of my mind.”</p>
 <p>The woman looked at me, rolling her eyes. She hurried to get up and pick up her clothes while enraged.</p>
 <p>When Li Mazi saw the mistress walking back and forth in a hurry, his jaw dropped open as he gawked. Then, he slapped himself. “Oh crap, what have I done! I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m leaving now.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t know if I should cry or laugh. I pulled Li Mazi. “Stop indulging in flights of fancy.”</p>
 <p>Then, I said to the mistress, “You should hurry to pack up and leave. I’m going out with my friend to get the stuff.”</p>
 <p>The mistress hesitated. “I… I’ll get my things packed shortly.”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed after I looked at her unsatisfied face. “Be quick. I can’t stay with you. You have too many evil things in your room, and I can’t handle them alone.”</p>
 <p>She then snorted and grabbed her bag, ready to leave.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi gasped once she was gone. “Why didn’t you take the chance? It was a good one!”</p>
 <p>I angrily kicked him. “Stop talking nonsense! The previous business case affected my mind. I haven’t recovered yet.”</p>
 <p>Looking at his questioning face, I knew it would be useless to explain. I simply dragged him away. We needed to buy some things.</p>
