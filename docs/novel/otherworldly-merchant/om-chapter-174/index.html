 <p>Shortly after, Li Mazi spurted man fluid. Mu Wan swiftly received it. Under the moonlight, she eyed and admired the fluid in her hand.</p>
 <p><em>Holy moly, what kind of fetish is this!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>I gawked at the scene and dropped my jaw in shock. When I saw Li Mazi’s happy face, I felt disgusted.</p>
 <p>While we were still contemplating, Mu Wan suddenly took the golden hairpin off of her hair bun. Instantly, her long, back hair cascaded, which made her look even more charming.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi opened his eyes wide. He dumbly stared at Mu Wan.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan smiled playfully. “Idiot.”</p>
 <p>Then, she dipped the golden hairpin into the fluid and tried to smear the golden hairpin with the fluid.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Chuyi lunged out like a sharp sword being drawn from its sheath.</p>
 <p>While I was restless, he finally took action.</p>
 <p>After seeing Chuyi, Mu Wan didn’t show fear or anxiety. She calmly continued to smear the golden hairpin.</p>
 <p>Chuyi said coldly, “Vixen, you use despicable evil magic to harm people. I won’t let you go tonight.”</p>
 <p>Mu Wan snorted. Her voice was extremely alluring, which made people intoxicated.</p>
 <p>“Brother Mazi, they want to kill me. Can you protect me?” Mu Wan’s soft voice ordered.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi nodded obediently. Then, he glared at us angrily. He seemed ready to lunge forward at any minute.</p>
 <p>Chuyi told us, “You guys deal with Li Mazi. I’m going to take care of Mu Wan.”</p>
 <p>Then, he drew his sword and aimed toward Mu Wan. I immediately pinned Li Mazi underneath me and yelled at his face, “You jerk, wake up. Hurry!</p>
 <p>But how could it be so easy wake Li Mazi up? He closed his eyes as his hands stirred around. He was very strong. Shortly after, he threw me away and slapped me twice.</p>
 <p><em>Damn, he’s really possessed!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>I was hurt and gritted my teeth. Since I couldn’t attack him with my arms or legs, I had to bite him.</p>
 <p>However, my bite didn’t work. Li Mazi slapped me one more time. I was so angry that I planned to give him a good lesson when he woke up!</p>
 <p>I looked at Senior Shu, who was calmly separating a tattered bandage. I called him for help. He said with a smile, “Young man, put up with it for a while. I’m almost done here.”</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, I could only rely on myself. After seeing Li Mazi raise his hand again, I gritted my teeth and mustered my strength. I bit the tip of my tongue. Before he could hit me, I sprayed the blood onto his face.</p>
 <p>The blood from the tip of the tongue carried powerful energy. Li Mazi backed off. I seized the chance and got up. Then I kicked him aside. Coincidently, he landed on Senior Shu.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu was sent to the ground by Li Mazi, causing him to curse loudly. Li Mazi then slapped him and almost knocked out the old man.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing standing like an idiot?! Use the shroud strip to cover Li Mazi’s mouth!” Senior Shu screamed.</p>
 <p><em>Ah, it turns out that tattered strip is some shroud!</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t care how disgusting the shroud bandage was. I grabbed it and jumped onto Li Mazi. I shoved it into his mouth.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was scared and started struggling. I directly used my body to lock his. No matter how hard he wiggled, I didn’t let go of him.</p>
 <p>Luckily, the struggling ceased. I was able to subdue him eventually.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, I suddenly felt that something was blowing cold air at my neck. I was startled. Instinctively, I wanted to turn around to see.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu reminded me, “Kid, don’t turn around. You’ll get possessed.”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t do anything else but ignore it. However, it didn’t seem like only one person was blowing cold air at my neck.</p>
 <p>I tried to suppress my fear and focused on Li Mazi. Slowly, he stopped wiggling. Now, I could check Chuyi.</p>
 <p>The two weren’t fighting as I had imagined.</p>
 <p>I saw Chuyi sitting cross-legged on the ground. He was mumbling something. Mu Wan was so scared that her face was pale. She wanted to escape.</p>
 <p>However, circling around her were many white snakes. She didn’t dare to run but tried to control Li Mazi to help her.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu and I had already subdued Li Mazi, so how could he rescue Mu Wan? Mu Wan was flustered and screamed, “Go!”</p>
 <p>As soon as she screamed, I felt the shadows behind me dash toward Mu Wan. Another shadow got out of Li Mazi’s body. Altogether, they grouped and entered Mu Wan’s body, disappearing.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan looked as though she had depleted all of her energy. She slumped and crouched on the ground, falling unconscious.</p>
 <p>I exhaled in relief and ran toward Chuyi.</p>
 <p>Chuyi felt a heat in his throat. He spurted a mouthful of dark blood. His face looked terrible.</p>
 <p>I carefully supported Chuyi. “Are you all right? Do you want me to take you to the hospital?”</p>
 <p>“No… There’s no need.”</p>
 <p>Chuyi looked really weak. He shook his head and said to me, “You must burn all those white snakes, then we need to leave this haunted house. Hurry up!”</p>
 <p>Then, he also fell unconscious.</p>
 <p>I did as he had told me. There was garbage everywhere in this abandoned house. I found some dry sticks and piled up the snakes. I burned them.</p>
 <p>Those snakes were lively earlier. However, after Chuyi vomited blood, they began to look drowsy and tired. When I threw them into the fire, they woke up. They jumped and wiggled and tried to run away.</p>
 <p>I was startled and tried to capture them back. Senior Shu stopped me and said, “Chuyi wants to wake them up and let them go. He doesn’t really want to burn them to death.”</p>
 <p>I put Chuyi on my back and asked Senior Shu to carry Mu Wan and Li Mazi. We left the place.</p>
 <p>I didn’t take them directly to the hospital. Instead, I took them to a hotel nearby. I didn’t want to catch the attention of the police.</p>
 <p>Chuyi, Li Mazi, and Mu Wan were unconscious. I didn’t know what to do, so I asked, “Senior Shu, what should we do now?”</p>
 <p>“Just wait. They will wake up by themselves,” said Senior Shu. Then he left.</p>
 <p>I panicked and pulled him back. I asked him to stay with me. As the three were still unconscious and I wasn’t experienced enough, I needed an expert to stay with me.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu snorted. “I can’t stay in a high-profile place like this. Otherwise, my enemies will spot me.”</p>
 <p>Then, he ignored me and left.</p>
 <p>After looking at the three sleeping people, I was speechless. I didn’t know what to do.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mu Wan wiggled. Then, her slender body sat up from the bed. She looked at me with pitiful eyes. “Brother, can you please save me? I don’t feel well…”</p>
 <p>I looked at her. She looked like a pear blossom flower under the rain as she cried. I couldn’t stand it.</p>
 <p>However, I was sure that Mu Wan wasn’t someone to be underestimated. I shouldn’t help her!</p>
 <p>I immediately took out the Sirius Whip and coldly said, “If you don’t behave, don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p>
 <p>Mu Wan didn’t resist. Her body slumped softly and fell unconscious again.</p>
 <p><em>Did she just gather the last bit of her strength to tell me that...?</em></p>
