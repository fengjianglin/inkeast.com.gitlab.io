 <p>Lin Zhongcheng didn’t sound pleased. “Mr. Zhang, we’ve already closed the case. If you stir things up again, I’m afraid it will create a disturbance.”</p>
 <p>It was clear that Lin Zhongcheng didn’t want us to do any further investigations.</p>
 <p>I could only agree with him… No matter what I said, he wouldn’t change his mind.</p>
 <p>The night was quiet. I sat by the balcony and looked at the lights outside.</p>
 <p>Ru Xue and Yin Xinyue were cooking dinner. Although the food smelled delicious, I didn’t have any appetite.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi sat beside me and smoked to ease his worries. “Why do you want to put your nose in this woman’s business?”</p>
 <p>I could only force a smile. Since he couldn’t understand the reason, it proved that Li Mazi didn’t want anyone to take Chu Chu’s place.</p>
 <p>After dinner, I brought them to the elevator. We took it and went to the third floor.</p>
 <p>An hour passed. It was now the time Ru Xue normally came home after work. It was also the time the red-dressed ghost left apartment No. 304.</p>
 <p>Lin Zhongcheng had given us the key to apartment No. 304, and he did not take it back. I unlocked the door and entered the apartment, but I didn’t notice anything strange.</p>
 <p>We switched on the lights and checked every corner; it was all normal. Yet, I was a little bewildered because I smelled a pungent scent, similar to the smell of turd.</p>
 <p>This smell permeated the entire apartment. I checked around but couldn’t find the source.</p>
 <p>The room was in order, but since some of the windows were open, there was a layer of thick dust. I cleaned the tea table in the living room and placed the dress on it. To trigger the spirit, I even smeared some eel blood on the clothes.</p>
 <p>Afterward was a long and boring wait.</p>
 <p>During the day, Yin Xinyue and Ru Xue seemed fine. They had fun and did not seem to mind the circumstances we were in. However, at night, when they had to face the ghost, they didn’t dare to utter a word. They curled up on the sofa and gingerly gazed at the ancient dress.</p>
 <p>The room was dead silent, so silent that one could hear the sound of a needle falling to the ground. Soon, the people walking on the streets started to disperse, and dark clouds covered the moon. It was getting chilly…</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>A wind blew in from the kitchen and brought with it the horrible smell of turd. The wind made the dress fall to the ground. I jolted up and carefully watched the dress. Ru Xue almost screamed in fear, but Yin Xinyue covered her mouth.</p>
 <p>I took out the Universe Compass and looked at the hand of the compass. This item was an antique my grandpa had left me. He told me that if I used blood to stimulate the compass, the hand of the compass could sense the location of ghosts and spirits.</p>
 <p>I cut the tip of my finger and smeared the blood on the compass.</p>
 <p>The compass seemed to receive a powerful boost and started to spin quickly.</p>
 <p>As the compass’s hand slowed down, it pointed at the dress.</p>
 <p>As expected, the red-clothed ghost was now attached to the ancient dress!</p>
 <p>As I waited for the dress to make the next move, the hand on the Universe Compass began to move slightly. It deviated from the ancient dress and eventually stopped at Ru Xue.</p>
 <p>My heart skipped a beat. Ru Xue was also very nervous. She looked at me and stuttered, “Brother-in-law, w-what does that mean?”</p>
 <p>I waved my hand and motioned at Ru Xue to step aside a little bit.</p>
 <p>Ru Xue stepped to the side, but the Universe Compass didn’t change its direction.</p>
 <p>I breathed out in relief. It seemed the spirit didn’t want to harm Ru Xue.</p>
 <p>However, I was puzzled. What did the compass want to show? I walked in the direction of the compass and saw that the hand was pointing at the couch. Behind the couch was the refrigerator, and behind the refrigerator was the wall.</p>
 <p>Could it be that something was wrong with the fridge?</p>
 <p>I glanced at Li Mazi and asked him to open the fridge.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi quickly opened the fridge. The fridge was stuffed with vegetables, meats, beverages, and other food. There was nothing strange about it.</p>
 <p><em>What is the Universe Compass pointing at?</em></p>
 <p>As I was thinking about this, the Universe Compass changed its direction again. It now pointed at the ancient dress.</p>
 <p>When I looked at the dress, I began to sweat. The clothes were now ‘sitting’ upward. The empty garments were now ‘filled’ as if someone invisible was wearing the clothes.</p>
 <p>One sleeve was on the couch while the other was placed on the tea table. From this posture, it seemed that the dress was about to stand up.</p>
 <p>Eventually, after several tries, the ancient dress stood up. After looking at the hollow sleeves, collar, and legs, my scalp went numb!</p>
 <p>Although I couldn’t see who was wearing the ancient garments, I could recognize it was a young woman. She had a nice figure and curves in the right places.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi silently picked up a fancy blue-and-white vase, ready to strike at any time. Ru Xue and Yin Xinyue were also getting ready to run.</p>
 <p>The ancient dress stood still for a short moment before heading toward the entrance; it floated away in its ‘human form.’</p>
 <p>A strange wind blew the door open, which allowed the dress to leave. I didn’t hesitate and called out, “Follow it!”</p>
 <p>Then, I immediately ran after the clothes.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, there was no one on the third floor. Otherwise, they would be scared out of their wits.</p>
 <p>The moment the ancient dress came to the elevator, the doors opened. The dress immediately got it.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was very keen on chasing after the dress and barge into the elevator. However, I stopped him. “Do you want to become the third person to go missing?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was furious. “That spirit is such a bully. If I don’t give it a lesson, I won’t be able to quell my anger!”</p>
 <p>Since Chu Chu had died due to an evil spirit, Li Mazi hated them.</p>
 <p>“Now is not the time to lose control. Follow me.”</p>
 <p>Since the lift had closed, we took the emergency staircases. When we reached the first floor, the elevator also stopped on the first floor. The ancient dress was still inside.</p>
 <p>I exhaled in relief and carefully watched the scene.</p>
 <p>When the ancient clothes got out of the elevator, I saw a shadow sneak into the lift. Needless to say, it was the ghost of the delivery guy.</p>
 <p>One left while the other returned.</p>
 <p>I didn’t have time to care about the ghost of the delivery guy right now. I decided to follow the ancient dress.</p>
 <p>The dress floated around and moved on the streets. We followed closely behind it.</p>
 <p>It moved through the big streets then into the small alleys. It was leaving the urban area. Moreover, it only chose small, dark roads to travel on.</p>
 <p>The Universe Compass continuously pointed at the ancient dress; I knew the ghost was still there. Since the Universe Compass wasn’t needed anymore, I put it away and focused on the dress.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the ancient dress reached a remote area. These were the suburbs, where many migrant workers mingled together. They crowded the place and lived in bad conditions, forming a sharp contrast with the people living in the city.</p>
 <p>Why did the ghost come here?</p>
 <p>If it was the doing of an otherworldly item, it probably meant that the item was obsessed with something. I wanted to know what the obsession was about!</p>
