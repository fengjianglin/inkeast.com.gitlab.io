<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The short-haired girl in the miniskirt was rather shy and kept her distance from us.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know why, but whenever our eyes met, she’d blush and stoop her head.</p>
 <p>The man in the Kumamon t-shirt looked like Song Joong-ki from ‘Descendants of the Sun’, so the schoolgirls liked him a lot. They all wanted to take pictures with him. One of the girls even posted the pictures on Tieba Baidu with a caption that read: [We met a cold and handsome oppa in Fengmen Village! It was awesome! Guys, leave some replies and I’ll give you this handsome oppa’s contact!]</p>
 <p>I smiled awkwardly since there seemed to be no danger. <em>It doesn’t even feel like we’re here to find an otherworldly item, but to date instead!</em></p>
 <p>After the mysterious man finished his photo session, Li Mazi asked the girls to take a few pictures with him. However, the girls told him that they didn’t have enough space on their phones. Then, they hopped around, starting to explore the village.</p>
 <p>The mysterious man looked at the girls as they left , sighing unhappily.</p>
 <p>I asked him, “What’s the matter? Did you notice something?”</p>
 <p>He shook his head and kept silent.</p>
 <p>We picked up our luggage and tried to find a good place to camp.</p>
 <p>Although the buildings in Fengmen Village had been eroding for years, they were still standing, which was almost a miracle. Still, all the houses were covered with ivy or other crawling plants, and when looking through the gaps between doors and windows, we could only see darkness inside.</p>
 <p>I suddenly remembered some of the rumors about Fengmen Village that I’d read online, and I decided to see if they were true.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, I found the armchair that would kill you within a month if you sat on it, and also saw a broken coffin. It was rumored that whenever Fengmen Village was covered in fog, a red-eyed undead creature would come out of it.</p>
 <p>Still, I didn’t really know if these were real stories or just rumors!</p>
 <p>All the buildings in the village had surprisingly large cracks, and I was afraid that they’d simply collapse if a gust of wind blew over. Eventually, we found a single-story house that seemed to look better than the others.</p>
 <p>As soon as we entered, we were welcomed by a moldy stench.</p>
 <p>A cracked and worn out board still hung on the door, which read ‘Honorarium Hall’. From what I’d read about Fengmen Village in a travel guide, this place should be where the elderly stayed.</p>
 <p>We unfolded the blankets, spread them on the ground, and prepared to rest.</p>
 <p>In the meantime, the man in the Kumamon t-shirt removed a small porcelain bottle from his pocket, sprinkling some white powder at the house’s entrance.</p>
 <p>Out of curiosity, Li Mazi asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>The mysterious man replied, “It’s to prevent toxic bugs and snakes from getting inside.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the white powder worked, and I saw a black snake crawling up to the threshold before immediately turning around.</p>
 <p>I then asked the mysterious man, “Did you find traces of the corpse pearl?”</p>
 <p><span>He shook his head. “I haven’t found anything yet, but when night falls, we can go out and check. I’m sure we’ll find something.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>He wasn’t someone who’d speak nonsense. If he said that we’d find something, there was nothing to worry about.</p>
 <p>Since we had to take action at night, it was best to rest well during the day to save some energy!</p>
 <p>Li Mazi and I pulled our blankets over our bodies and prepared to sleep. The mysterious man, on the other hand, meticulously folded a piece of paper.</p>
 <p>Out of curiosity, I asked, “What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>He answered, “Folding a paper crane.”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but laugh. I didn’t think that he’d use this method to kill time. <em>Isn’t that something only girls like to do?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t talk anymore and closed my eyes as I started to drift off to sleep. <span>&nbsp;When I woke up, I smelled an intoxicating aroma.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>I sat up and found that those schoolgirls were sitting beside the mysterious man, chatting with him.</p>
 <p>Even though the man in the Kumamon t-shirt kept a poker face the whole time and listened silently, it didn’t affect the girls’ interest and they kept chatting with him.</p>
 <p>Only the short-haired girl, who was sitting by my side, was still shy. When I opened my eyes, they coincidentally met hers. Once again, she lowered her head bashfully.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t sleep due to their chirping. So, I started playing games on my phone.</p>
 <p>After a while, the man in the Kumamon t-shirt finally spoke, “Are you girls really planning to stay in the village tonight? Aren’t you afraid?”</p>
 <p>“It’s all right. With so many men here to protect us, what is there to fear?” said a girl with heavy makeup.</p>
 <p>I smelled the strong aroma again. <em>Perhaps it comes from the cheap perfume the girl is wearing...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The mysterious man asked, “Who suggested for you to stay here tonight? It’s not a good idea.”</p>
 <p>“It was Jing Jing,” said the girl with heavy makeup. “She’s that short-haired girl over there. She’s the youngest among us, and she said that it’d be great to stay over for some extra excitement.”</p>
 <p>The words of the girl with heavy makeup were ambiguous, and I wondered if she was flirting with the man in the Kumamon t-shirt. However, the mysterious man smiled faintly and gave each girl a paper crane. “You should go to sleep, because I’d also like to get some sleep.”</p>
 <p>Then, he walked towards me, signaling me with his eyes to stop using my phone and seize the time to sleep some more.</p>
 <p>When I saw his eyes, my heart jumped, feeling that there was something wrong with his expression.</p>
 <p>I switched my phone off and pretended to sleep.</p>
 <p>The girls looked unsatisfied, but there was nothing they could do. After the man in the Kumamon t-shirt had settled near me, they also returned to their respective tents.</p>
 <p>I didn’t sleep since his expression from before kept flashing in my mind.</p>
 <p><em>I’m sure he has something important to tell me!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Around an hour later, after all the girls were fast asleep, he used a finger to poke me. I opened my eyes and looked at him.</p>
 <p>He pointed outside and walked out.</p>
 <p>I hurried to follow him, exiting the cottage.</p>
 <p>After I’d steadied myself, I asked, “There was something wrong with those girls, right?”</p>
 <p>The mysterious man nodded. “Did you smell a strange aroma earlier?”</p>
 <p>I replied, “Yes, I did. It smelled like cheap perfume.”</p>
 <p>“It wasn’t perfume.” The mysterious man smiled coldly. “It was corpse aroma.”</p>
 <p>“Corpse aroma?” I jolted. “What’s that? And, where was it coming from?”</p>
 <p>“The undead have a very special smell. They use it to attract humans, which then become their prey. It’s some sort of innate skill.”</p>
 <p>My jaw dropped in shock. “D-Do you mean… that those girls are undead creatures?”</p>
 <p>The mysterious man said, “I’m still not sure if the corpse aroma comes from the girls or the Honorarium Hall. Anyway, I guess they’ll try to do something nasty tonight. Be careful!”</p>
 <p>“Wait a second, what does the Honorarium Hall have to do with the corpse aroma?” I was puzzled. “It’s just an abandoned single-story building. When we arrived during the day, I even sensed that moldy smell.”</p>
 <p>The mysterious man furrowed his brows and asked, “Do you know what people used the Honorarium Hall for?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head, feeling a little fearful. “I don’t. What did they use it for?”</p>
 <p>“To store corpses. This place is the so-called ‘corpse house’,” said the man in the Kumamon t-shirt.</p>
 <p>My scalp went numb. I didn’t think that we were actually sleeping inside a corpse house!</p>
 <p>If I’d known that earlier, I never would’ve entered the place, not even if I were beaten to death.</p>
 <p>Flustered, I asked, “What do we do now? I don’t think I can stay in this place any longer.”</p>
 <p>He replied, “It’s better to pass the night here. If we leave now, it could be worse.”</p>
 <p>Then, he returned to the cottage.</p>
 <p>I could only helplessly follow him.</p>
 <p>But, after returning to the cottage, I couldn’t sleep anymore. <span><em>Those girls might be undead creatures, and we are spending the night in a corpse house!</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Even if I were bolder, I still wouldn’t be able to sleep!</p>
 <p>Of course, since Li Mazi knew nothing, he was fast asleep, snoring noisily.</p>
 <p>I turned a little and felt the Sirius Whip underneath my body.</p>
 <p>In case something unexpected happened, I could quickly grab the whip and counterattack.</p>
 <p>After midnight, at around 3 AM, I heard the zipper of the tent being pulled down. I tensed up and tried to sense even the smallest movement.</p>
 <p>A young girl wearing pajamas came out of the tent. She stood at the entrance for a while and then abruptly called my name.</p>
 <p>I immediately got goosebumps. <span><em>Why is she calling me?</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>I pretended to be sleeping and didn’t answer.</p>
 <p>As her repeated calling couldn’t wake me up, she came to me and gently patted me.</p>
 <p>When she came closer, I could clearly smell that strange aroma.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, it came from her body. Now, I was even more frightened. <span><em>Is she really a zombie?</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Still, I’d never seen a zombie as beautiful as her.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t pretend to sleep anymore and had no choice but to open my eyes to see who was shaking me. It turned out that it was the short-haired girl, Jing Jing.</p>
 <p>I asked in a daze, “What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>Jing Jing made a gesture, hinting for me to keep silent. Then, she whispered, “Can you come out for a moment? I need your help with something.”</p>
 <p>I furrowed my brow, but still gave her a nod. “Okay.”</p>
 <p>I secretly shoved the Sirius Whip in my pants and went out with her while trembling.</p>
 <p>While walking behind her, I observed her every move. I didn’t notice anything strange, but her swaying buttocks, slim waist, and long arms were beautiful.</p>
 <p>It was really hard to imagine that such a beautiful lady was an undead creature.</p>
 <p>After walking out of the single-story building, Jing Jing turned around and looked at me shyly. “I have a few blisters on my feet. They really hurt. Can you help me prick them?”</p>
 <p><span><em>Holy shit, what's happening?</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span><em>Does she want me to prick her blisters or is she trying to seduce me?!</em></span></p>
