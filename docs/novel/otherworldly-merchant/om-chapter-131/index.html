 <p>I finally could heave a sigh of relief. I turned around and watched Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei. They were still chanting some sacred texts. Zen Master Baimei was using his mala beads on Li Mazi and Chu Chu.</p>
 <p>I knew it wasn’t over, but I couldn’t help them with anything. The only thing I could do was sit and worry.</p>
 <p>While I was feeling restless, Li Mazi and Chu Chu suddenly sprung up from the ground.</p>
 <p>I was so happy. I walked forward and asked, “Li Mazi, how do you feel now?”</p>
 <p>However, Li Mazi suddenly grabbed onto my shoulders. I could feel his fingers, like a pair of iron pliers, tightly grip my shoulders.</p>
 <p>I shook my body in pain. However, Li Mazi didn’t want to release me!</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei shouted. He used his mala beads and hit Li Mazi in the face with them. Li Mazi screeched and pushed me aside.</p>
 <p>I hit two chairs and fell to the ground. This fall was really serious as I felt my internal organs somewhat get dislocated. I had to lie on the ground for quite a long time before I could get up…</p>
 <p>After Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei finished their chanting, Chu Chu woke up first. She vomited black blood then slumped feebly on the ground.</p>
 <p>I hurried to support her and pulled her up. “Chu Chu, are you all right?”</p>
 <p>Chu Chu turned to look at Li Mazi with a worried expression. I knew she was too weak and couldn’t talk. “Everything’s alright now. You should rest first.”</p>
 <p>As for Li Mazi, no matter how hard Zen Master Baimei and Chuyi chanted, he didn’t open his eyes.</p>
 <p>His body was stiff and he looked hostile enough to attack everybody!</p>
 <p>Eventually, Zen Master Baimei said, “Is that Thai sorcerer crazy? We’ve broken his magic and injured him gravely. Yet, he still wants to fight against us?”</p>
 <p>Then he stomped and kicked Li Mazi to the ground. He used his mala beads and tied them around Li Mazi’s neck. The beads held him still.</p>
 <p>Chuyi glanced at me. “Zhang Jiulin, you have to suck the cursed blood out of Li Mazi. If you can do that, everything will be alright.”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but shiver. “I have to use my mouth to suck it from his mouth?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi said, “Of course. You have to do it as soon as possible. Zen Master Baimei can’t hold it any longer…”</p>
 <p>Indeed, shortly afterward, Li Mazi sent Zen Master Baimei aside with a loud thud. The old monk was really old. How could he resist Li Mazi, who was young and under a spell?</p>
 <p>I looked at Zen Master Baimei and saw him grimace. I knew he couldn’t hold it for much longer.</p>
 <p>Chuyi panicked. He dashed forward, grabbed Li Mazi’s arms and pushed them down. He turned around and said to me, “Quickly!”</p>
 <p><em>Damn! I can’t care about hygiene now!</em></p>
 <p>Immediately, I planted my mouth onto Li Mazi’s mouth and sucked.</p>
 <p>I felt I had sucked some sticky fluid, which felt very nauseating. I couldn’t help but retch then continue to suck.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi’s strength was slowly draining. When he slumped on the ground like a muddy puddle, I finally exhaled. I put him aside and gasped for my breath.</p>
 <p>Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei also looked exhausted.</p>
 <p>I fetched three mineral water bottles from the fridge and gave them the bottles.</p>
 <p>“Is everything done now?” I asked Chuyi.</p>
 <p>He nodded and said, “Almost…”</p>
 <p>I almost vomited blood from anger. <em>Holy moly! I gave away my first kiss and you’re telling me it’s only ‘almost’ done? What do you mean by almost done?!</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t know what to do at this point.</p>
 <p>Chuyi said, “Nothing major will happen now. We should rest well tonight. Tomorrow, we will wrap this up and resolve the issue.”</p>
 <p>After listening to Chuyi’s comforting words, I felt better. After drinking mineral water, I took Li Mazi and Chu Chu to the bed while Zen Master Baimei, Chuyi, and I slept on the ground.</p>
 <p>At dawn, my body felt alright so I got up and did some stretches. I checked on Li Mazi and saw that he was sleeping. However, the others weren’t in the room.</p>
 <p>When I stepped out, I saw Chu Chu preparing breakfast. She looked much better. Zen Master Baimei and Chuyi were silently drinking tea.</p>
 <p>I hurriedly asked them, “Is Li Mazi okay now? Why is he still sleeping?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi didn’t answer my questions. “After breakfast, we’re going to the funeral home. There’s something we must finish there.”</p>
 <p>I nodded.</p>
 <p>Even after we had breakfast, Li Mazi didn’t show any signs of waking up. However, his face now showed color and he was lying on the bed. It was as if he was sleeping.</p>
 <p>I turned to Chuyi and said, “Is Li Mazi going to be okay?”</p>
 <p>After receiving confirmation from Chuyi, I felt my mind at ease. We then headed to the funeral home.</p>
 <p>However, when we arrived at the funeral home and asked to see Old Qi, the security guy fumed. “You want to see Old Qi? Even I don’t know where the heck he has gone! We have many corpses waiting here to be incinerated. No one just disappears like that!”</p>
 <p>In desperation, I couldn’t do anything else but call Old Qi.</p>
 <p>However, I called him several times but no one picked up the phone. I became worried.</p>
 <p><em>Did something happen to Old Qi?</em></p>
 <p>I knew Old Qi well. He was a middle-aged man with a family to feed. He really appreciated his job and placed more importance on his job than his life! In the last ten years, he never went on a vacation. He never disappeared from work during working hours!</p>
 <p><em>Where could he have gone?</em></p>
 <p>At this moment, Chuyi patted my shoulder. “Did he often disappear without a known cause like this?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head.</p>
 <p>Chuyi took a deep breath. “Take me to see the pregnant corpse right now.”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t do anything else but call Old Qi’s apprentice. I asked for his help.</p>
 <p>Old Qi’s apprentice directly took us to the funeral home.</p>
 <p>The funeral home was cold as usual. I wrapped my clothes tightly around myself, but it didn’t help. Oh well, it wasn’t a big deal since I would only stay here for a short time.</p>
 <p>After we got in, Chuyi led us to a mortuary freezer cabinet and frowned. “Is the pregnant corpse kept in this cabinet?”</p>
 <p>I was startled. How did he know that? Although the cabinets were coded, it was impossible for him to know the pregnant corpse’s code.</p>
 <p>Old Qi’s apprentice nodded. “Yes, that’s right. It’s right there.”</p>
 <p>Chuyi took a deep breath and left the morgue.</p>
 <p>I hurried and caught up to him. “What’s going on? Aren’t you going to check the pregnant corpse?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi halted and turned around to talk to me. “The pregnant corpse is not inside that cabinet…”</p>
 <p>"No?” I was bewildered and looked at him. “How could you know that?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi said, “Nevermind that. If you don’t want to cause trouble, follow me. Hurry up!”</p>
 <p>I knew Chuyi had his reasons. I followed him but in my heart, I still had a lot of questions.</p>
 <p><em>How does he know that the corpse of the pregnant woman isn’t in that freezer?</em></p>
 <p><em>And, he said that if we open the freezer, we would cause trouble. What does that mean? The pregnant woman’s corpse will pester us?</em></p>
 <p>However, all of my questions were answered not long after we left the morgue.</p>
 <p>I heard the Old Qi’s apprentice shriek. “Oh my God! Oh my God! Help! Help me!”</p>
 <p>Then he rushed out with a panic-stricken expression.</p>
 <p>I was scared and stopped him. “Hey, hey, are you okay?”</p>
 <p>“The freezer… M-my teacher is in the freezer!” Old Qi’s apprentice’s eyes bulged. “Help! Guys! Something bad has happened!”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but take a deep breath. I turned and looked at Chuyi.</p>
 <p>Chuyi explained this situation. “I underestimated them. Those Thai people stole the pregnant corpse. They’re about to take revenge. It’s possible that Old Qi found them in the middle of their act, so they killed him!”</p>
 <p>“Damn, these bastards are ruthless! They kill people as they please!” I scoffed. “But you said that if we opened the freezer, big trouble would happen. What’s that about?”</p>
 <p>“The morgue has surveillance cameras. If we open the freezer, the police will come to our door. Go, quickly! Li Mazi might be in danger!”</p>
 <p>Then he left in a hurry.</p>
 <p>This was a complicated situation. I thought everything would be over; but now, more problems had come our way.</p>
 <p>I wondered what kind of deep grudge those people had against me, enough for them to invest so much effort to deal with me. They had even killed innocent people to achieve their purpose.</p>
 <p>Then I vaguely felt an invisible pair of hands grab onto me. These hands would never let me go until they could turn me into some meat sausage!</p>
