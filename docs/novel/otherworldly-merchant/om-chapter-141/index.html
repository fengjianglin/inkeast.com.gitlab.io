 <p>I glanced at Liu Laogen. “I thought that you were a pitiful family, but I’d have never thought that you were all greedy bastards! There’s a proverb that says that not all poor people are saints, and it turned out to be true. If you want to live, you should ask the villagers for help. Otherwise, even if you had ten of me, I still couldn’t save you!”</p>
 <p>Liu Laogen hesitated. His face bowed down in defeat.</p>
 <p>“Our reputation in this town isn’t good. We’ve done a lot of unkind things. I’m afraid the villagers don’t want to help us.”</p>
 <p>I kicked him in rage and Liu Laogen finally gave in. “All right, all right, I’m going to call them here right now!”</p>
 <p>It was later than midnight when Liu Laogen knocked on every door.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he had gathered a large group of villagers. I had a strong feeling that Liu Laogen had used money to bribe them.</p>
 <p>He brought the group to me and asked, “What should we do next?”</p>
 <p>“We have to dig up the well and fish up the Tai Sui. We have to subdue it.”</p>
 <p>The villagers grabbed their shovels and hoes and started to dig up the ancient well.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a small task that could be done in one night. However, since Liu Laogen’s family’s lives were on the line, I had to ask the villagers to work harder.</p>
 <p>Actually, it was dangerous to provoke this thing at this time. After midnight was always the time of thickest resentful energy.</p>
 <p>The villagers were also scared, and no one wanted to dig the well further. Liu Laogen had to throw ten thousand renminbi out before two young men volunteered for the job.</p>
 <p>Around 4 AM, they had reached the bottom of the well. Slowly, water oozed up from the muddy ground.</p>
 <p>We heard a gurgling sound. Instantly, the muddy ground underneath their feet subsided. The two young men screamed in fear. They shouted and asked us to pull them up.</p>
 <p>They huddled together and crouched on the ground, gasping for their breath. “What’s that thing below? How can it push through the soil like that? Is it a monster?”</p>
 <p>I comforted them. “It’s all right. Use the rope to hoist the Tai Sui up.”</p>
 <p>As soon as the Tai Sui was hoisted up, the temperature of the entire town dropped sharply. A strange wind blew over which made people shriek in fright.</p>
 <p>The Tai Sui didn’t look nice at all.</p>
 <p>It was translucent and meaty, just like a massive jelly. On the squishy, white flesh grew a human face with a nose, a mouth, and eyes…</p>
 <p>Although the facial features weren’t clear, it was definitely a face!</p>
 <p>The villagers were fearful, and they retreated from the villa’s area.</p>
 <p>After seeing the folks leave, I hurried to call them to stay. “We still need your help. Please don’t leave. I will ask Liu Laogen to double the payment. He’ll pay you directly after we’re done here.”</p>
 <p>I was also scared. However, I was the key force now. If I showed that I was scared, everything would be over.</p>
 <p>After hearing my voice, the villagers calmed down.</p>
 <p>Actually, I didn’t want to ask them to do anything else besides stay here. I just wanted to use the Yang energy from their bodies to prevent the Tai Sui’s resentful energy from taking over!</p>
 <p>To prevent someone from leaving stealthily, I gave Li Mazi a look. Li Mazi nodded and closed the villa’s gate.</p>
 <p>The moment the gate was closed, the Tai Sui roared. The roar was so loud that everyone’s ears hurt.</p>
 <p>This time, the villagers couldn’t stay calm. Their fear instantly overcame them as they retreated to the corner. If Li Mazi hadn’t closed the gate, they would have immediately evacuated.</p>
 <p><em>I must show them that I’ve got things under control!</em></p>
 <p>“I know you’re resentful, but you can’t just take their lives!” I thundered.</p>
 <p>Then, I lashed the Sirius Whip on that face.</p>
 <p>The moment the Sirius Whip hit the Tai Sui’s face, it emitted a high-frequency shriek, which made my heart shiver.</p>
 <p>At the same time, I felt something from the jade thumb ring on my index finger. It was tightening around my finger and absorbing my energy!</p>
 <p>The moment I realized this, I felt scared because I would need a lot of power to wield the whip.</p>
 <p>I knew if things continued this way, we would fail.</p>
 <p>Only the first seven attacks of the Sirius Whip would work well. After the seventh attack, it wouldn’t have any more power, which would make it no different from an ordinary whip. I had already lashed it four times. If I were to whip it seven times without much progress, it would be very difficult to defeat the Tai Sui. I couldn’t do anything else but stop and ask the villagers to bring me a black dog and two roosters.</p>
 <p>I killed the animals then poured their blood on the Sirius Whip.</p>
 <p><em>Life and death will be decided now!</em></p>
 <p>If I failed, the jade thumb ring would be able to control me and make me a fat foodie.</p>
 <p>I gritted my teeth and gathered my strength. Then, I raised the Sirius Whip high and lashed the Tai Sui three times!</p>
 <p>After the first whip, the Tai Sui produced a high-pitched screech. Everyone’s mind shivered, and people couldn’t hide their panic-stricken faces.</p>
 <p>Liu Laogen couldn’t endure the sound attack. He covered his ears and rolled on the ground.</p>
 <p>After the second whip, my momentum didn’t weaken. However, the Tai Sui had produced an even higher-pitched shriek.</p>
 <p>Some villagers couldn’t endure this torment. They lost their minds and ran around. The others tried to hold them down, but they opened their mouths and tried to bite them back.</p>
 <p>I shuddered. It was just a shriek and it could confuse people’s minds and make them crazy.</p>
 <p>If the Tai Sui used its full power, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine the consequences…</p>
 <p>I immediately shouted, “QUIET! CALM DOWN! You must capture those insane people and stop them from harming themselves. Guys, repeat after me. We’re going to chant some sacred text. It could stop that thing.”</p>
 <p>Then, I started to read the ‘sacred text of Daoism’ Chuyi had taught me.</p>
 <p>The sacred text of Daoism worked. When the whole group of people chanted the text, the Tai Sui was scared. This time, its scream didn’t follow any rule. It was the monster’s last struggle.</p>
 <p>I gritted my teeth and gathered the last bit of my strength. I forcefully lashed the whip on the Tai Sui’s face.</p>
 <p>After my full-power lash, the Tai Sui fumed black smoke.</p>
 <p>The black smoke didn’t cause any harm and it vanished shortly after. The scene resumed its quietness, with everybody’s eyes glued to the Tai Sui’s body.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi quickly rushed forward to support me.</p>
 <p>I could feel the jade thumb ring loosening on my finger. My power wasn’t being absorbed any further. I knew we were almost done here.</p>
 <p>"Burn it!”</p>
 <p>I forcibly took the jade thumb ring off my index finger and shoved it into the Tai Sui’s body.</p>
 <p>The villagers brought gasoline and directly splashed it on the Tai Sui. Then they lit up the fire.</p>
 <p>The Tai Sui was being burned by a high flame of four or five meters. I could see a vague shadow struggling inside the flame…</p>
 <p>Indeed, the monster had intelligence. It wanted to flee to the well and hide there. However, I had already used the rooster’s blood to draw a line to stop it.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, the Tai Sui was burned down. It was dead and had turned into a pile of ash.</p>
 <p>I let out a slight sigh. I turned around and didn’t care about Liu Laogen and his family.</p>
 <p>I knew I was wrong in this situation.</p>
 <p>To save a bunch of human beings who deserved to die, I had killed a good monster that had always kept its part of the agreement.</p>
 <p>But I had to do that because I was also a human!</p>
 <p>The Tai Sui’s mistake was that it had only remembered receiving precious water that year and it didn’t know the nature of human beings.</p>
 <p>Humans are all greedy. You give them a piece of meat, they will want two. You give them two pieces, and they will raise their butcher knife on you.</p>
 <p>Since the day it made that agreement, the Tai Sui was doomed to suffer this fate.</p>
