 <p>A humanoid figure was crawling out of the cave they had dug open. Something sparkled in his mouth. It was the rumored Night Pearl.</p>
 <p>I then recognized the humanoid thing was actually a very old, dried corpse.</p>
 <p><em>A dried corpse that could still move!</em></p>
 <p>The dried corpse and the young man’s father had ended up in the same way!</p>
 <p>The bead they obtained from the dried corpse’s mouth was apparently an extremely malicious otherworldly item. I guessed that the reason why the young man’s father had become a walking corpse was because of that bead…</p>
 <p>Li Mazi checked the photo then said, “How many people do you think were in their team?”</p>
 <p>The young man didn’t hesitate and said, “Three.”</p>
 <p>I shook my head. “No, not just three.”</p>
 <p>The young man was astounded and looked at me. “But there are only three people in the photo.”</p>
 <p>“If there were only three people, then who took the photo?” I smiled.</p>
 <p>The young man became anxious. “Then where is the person who took that photo? Is he waiting somewhere nearby to ambush us?”</p>
 <p>I became tense immediately. All the answers we needed were with the person who took the photo. No matter what, we needed to find him. However, my phone suddenly rang. I took it out and saw that Yin Xinyue was calling me.</p>
 <p>I hit the answer button. “What’s up, Yin Xinyue?”</p>
 <p>A rude voice answered from the other side. “Where’s Liu Fuguo’s son? Let me talk to him!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the rude voice, I was bewildered. I immediately understood what was happening. Yin Xinyue and Chu Chu were in danger right now!</p>
 <p>I fumed and said, “Who the heck are you? I’m warning you. If you touch even a strand of hair on the two girls, I will come up with a hundred ways to take your life.”</p>
 <p>The man thundered and said, “Put Liu Fuguo’s son on the phone!”</p>
 <p>I turned on the phone’s speaker and handed the phone to the young man.</p>
 <p>The young man was scared and gasped. The man sneered. “Do as I say. Or else, you will no longer see the girls.”</p>
 <p>The young man panicked. “Don’t! We will listen to you. We will. Please, do not harm the ladies!”</p>
 <p>“Good, very good.” The man roared with laughter. “Now, take the Grave-Digging Scale from your father’s mouth and hand it over to me. You have one hour. If in one hour I do not see the treasure, I will push these two women off the motel.”</p>
 <p>“You’re crazy!” I bellowed in rage. “Let me hear them! I want to make sure they’re safe and sound!”</p>
 <p>“You’re so annoying.” The man scoffed then said, “Scream something for him to hear…”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue said feebly, “Brother Zhang, don’t… don’t worry about us…”</p>
 <p>“Shut up.” The man slapped Yin Xinyue then hung up the phone.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was so angry that his blood boiled.</p>
 <p>His love for Chu Chu wasn’t shallower than what I had for Yin Xinyue.</p>
 <p>Sigh, we were too careless. We were too focused on the walking dead and had left the two ladies in the motel.</p>
 <p>I wanted to go back and save them. However, after thinking about the so-called Grave-Digging Scale, I hesitated.</p>
 <p>If we didn’t bring the Grave-Digging Scale to exchange for the ladies, would the other person really push Yin Xinyue and Chu Chu off the building?</p>
 <p>I pondered and forced myself to clear my head. I turned to talk to Li Mazi. “Li Mazi, go back there now and try to keep him calm. Make sure he doesn’t hurt Yin Xinyue and Chu Chu. I’m going to the mountain to take the Grave-Digging Scale.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi nodded. “Okay. You guys should hurry. That scoundrel... I want to kill him with my own hands!”</p>
 <p>Then, Li Mazi moved as fast as lightning and left the village.</p>
 <p>I patted the young man’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. I will return the Grave-Digging Scale to you later.”</p>
 <p>The young man said, “Let’s leave it for later. We need to save the two ladies first!”</p>
 <p>We then headed to the mountain.</p>
 <p>When we arrived at the cave, we saw that the grave was open. There were scratches made by fingernails, as well as a big puddle of blood on the ground.</p>
 <p>The ‘Grave-Digging Scale’ was nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>The young man didn’t hesitate and pulled at the coffin. He opened the lid. The body laid quietly in the coffin. The corpse’s mouth was slightly open, and the Grave-Digging Scale was sparkling inside.</p>
 <p>The young man knelt with a loud thud. “Father, I want to borrow the Grave-Digging Scale for a while! After I use it, I will return it to you. Please bless the two sisters. I don’t want that bad guy to harm them!”</p>
 <p>The young man shivered and opened his father’s mouth. However, since the corpse was stiff, it was a hard task. The young man then had to use both hands to open the corpse’s mouth and take the Grave-Digging Scale out.</p>
 <p>The young man used his shirt to wipe the bead clean before giving it to me. “Brother, please hurry!”</p>
 <p>I patted his shoulder and left in a hurry.</p>
 <p>When I arrived at the motel, I knocked on the door. Li Mazi was with the other person.</p>
 <p>It turned out to be one-eyed man with a short beard. His eyes flashed maliciously, and there were many scratches on his body. He looked weak and dizzy.</p>
 <p>Whenever his mind went blurry, he used a dagger to cut his own arm. He was using the pain to keep a clear head.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue and Chu Chu were tied to two chairs. Their mouths were taped shut. When they saw us, they wiggled helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Chu Chu, don’t be afraid.” Li Mazi comforted Chu Chu and said, “We’re going to save you now.”</p>
 <p>Chu Chu didn’t look scared. She gave him a weak nod then turned to look at the one-eyed man.</p>
 <p>As soon as the one-eyed man saw the Grave-Digging Scale in my hand, he became greedy. “Quick… Give me the Grave-Digging Scale. Hurry!”</p>
 <p>“Release them first,” I snorted.</p>
 <p>“Shut up!” The one-eyed man’s face turned purple in rage. “I said, give me the Grave-Digging Scale!”</p>
 <p>I threw the Grave-Digging Scale to him.</p>
 <p>A soon as the man caught the Grave-Digging Scale, he was so excited his entire body shook. Then, without a bit of hesitation, he put it into his mouth.</p>
 <p>I felt nauseous. We had just taken that Grave-Digging Scale out of a corpse’s mouth!</p>
