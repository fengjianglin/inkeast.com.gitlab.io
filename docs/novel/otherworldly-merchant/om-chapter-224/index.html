 <p>After I wrapped up Old Chef’s case, Fengshen Nana respected me more. “You’re really incredible. You should join the police force to contribute to our society!”</p>
 <p>I forced a smile and said, “I’m not as noble as you think!”</p>
 <p>Fengshen Nana was disappointed. However, she still asked me to keep her business card in case I changed my mind. She could give me some recommendations.</p>
 <p>I looked at her figure and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I wondered why a beautiful woman like her had decided to become a policewoman. Wasn’t she afraid of getting hurt?</p>
 <p>After I returned to my shop, I spent almost every day studying the snakeskin drum. One day, while I was searching through the ancient books my grandfather had left in the shop, I found a book called ‘Five Immortals Records,’ which was about the old stories of the Northeastern Five Immortals.</p>
 <p>The book had a clear description of the chant that could invite the Immortals. It also mentioned the ancient snakeskin drum.</p>
 <p>I was surprised. I had never thought that my grandfather had such a vast collection. He had even collected books about the ‘Riding Immortals’ ritual.</p>
 <p>I was attracted by the contents of the book. I stopped leaving my shop and stayed inside my room, carefully studying the ‘Five Immortal Records’ every day.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know how long it had passed when I heard someone bang on my door. Eventually, I returned to my senses.</p>
 <p>When I got a hold of myself, I felt so weak and exhausted that I couldn’t even walk. I grabbed a bottle of mineral water and gulped it down.</p>
 <p>I wobbled absent-mindedly to the entrance. When I opened the door, I saw Yin Xinyue.</p>
 <p>She screamed as soon as she saw me, “Brother Zhang, how did you turn into this?!”</p>
 <p>I furrowed my brows and looked at Yin Xinyue in puzzlement. “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you have a mirror in your shop?” Yin Xinyue grabbed me and pulled me into the shop. “Here, take a look at yourself.”</p>
 <p>I was startled after seeing my image in the mirror. Disheveled wasn’t enough to describe me at this moment. I looked like a caveman who hadn’t been enlightened or civilized. My face and hair were greasy with dirt. I was wearing a pair of boxers and an undershirt. My skin looked dark, and I was covered in a layer of sweat.</p>
 <p>I cursed, “Holy crap, how did I turn into this? Wait for a moment. I’m going to take a shower.”</p>
 <p>However, everything turned black as I took a step. I had fainted.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know how long it had passed when I was awakened by Yin Xinyue’s voice. I opened my drowsy eyes and looked at her. She seemed restless and worried.</p>
 <p>I forced a smile and said, “I’m so hungry…”</p>
 <p>“So you can still feel hunger!” Yin Xinyue felt distressed and said, “I’m going to cook you a bowl of noodles. Wait a minute.”</p>
 <p>Then, she went to the kitchen to cook some noodles.</p>
 <p>I was puzzled. <em>Hasn’t it been just one day? How did I turn into this?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>I tried to get up from my bed and said, “Xinyue, how long have I been unconscious?”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue said, “Around three hours. I was really scared.”</p>
 <p>“Oh,” I glanced at the window and saw that it was dark outside. I took out my phone to check the time. I was dumbstruck right after that.</p>
 <p>“Xinyue, wait, don’t cook yet. Come here, I need to ask you something.” I called at Yin Xinyue.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue said, “If you have something to ask, just do it.”</p>
 <p>“What’s today’s date?” I asked.</p>
 <p>“April the fifteenth.” Yin Xinyue answered.</p>
 <p>“Shoot.” I got a chill down my spine. “I haven’t left my house for three days and haven’t eaten anything. No wonder I feel so weak.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Yin Xinyue looked at me in puzzlement. “I think you’re so hungry that you’re seeing things. You might be suffering from depression; you should go see a doctor.”</p>
 <p>“I’m telling the truth,” I said. I clearly remembered that it was April the tenth when I finished Fengshen Nana’s case. On April the twelfth, I found the ‘Five Immortals Records’ left by my grandfather. I was so absorbed with the book that I didn’t even leave my table…</p>
 <p>It was pretty scary. Was I bewitched by the book? I was certain that it wasn’t a normal book.</p>
 <p>I rushed to my desk to check, but it was empty. Nothing was there.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue placed a bowl of noodles in front of me. “Eat it quickly. Don’t let it cool down.”</p>
 <p>I was starving and didn’t have time to think about the ‘Five Immortals Records.’ I wolfed the food down. After eating, I lit a cigarette. “Yin Xinyue, did you see the book, ‘Five Immortals Records?’ I placed it on the desk.”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue was puzzled. “Have you really gone mad? What’s this ‘Five Immortal Records?’ When I cleaned your room, I only saw a dictionary on your desk. You wrote a lot of mysterious symbols on it. You’re acting really strange, you know?”</p>
 <p>“Where is it?” I asked Yin Xinyue to bring me the dictionary. I couldn’t believe that I had spent three days and nights on a freaking dictionary.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue took out the dictionary from my bookshelf. I took a glance at it, and my eyes widened in surprise. It was true that I had spent three days reading this dictionary because I recognized those small, strange symbols. I had marked them.</p>
 <p>I tried to search through my memory to remember what I had done during the past few days. However, my brain was blank; I couldn’t recall anything. In other words, those pieces of memories were a hallucination of mine and they didn’t exist.</p>
 <p><em>What’s going on? Could it be that this dictionary has a problem?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>I held the dictionary and checked it thoroughly. However, I found nothing strange about it. I cut the tip of my middle finger and dripped a drop of blood on it. The blood seeped into the dictionary, but there was no reaction.</p>
 <p>This dictionary wasn’t an otherworldly item.</p>
 <p>If the dictionary wasn’t an otherworldly item, had someone put a spell on me and caused me to be in a daze for three days? This idea scared me out of my wits. If Yin Xinyue hadn’t come to visit me, I might have died.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Yin Xinyue looked at my pale face and wiped the cold sweat on my forehead.</p>
 <p>“Something’s wrong. This situation isn’t right. Xinyue, when you came here, did you see any suspicious person around my shop?”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue thought for a while. “A suspicious person? Ah, if you didn’t mention this, I would have forgotten already. When I arrived at the shop, I saw a beautiful girl. She stood at your shop front and looked around. She even peeped through the door. I asked her what she was doing, but she didn’t answer me.”</p>
 <p>“Damn, we have to catch that woman!” I screamed.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue stopped me and said, “She’s already gone. Who are you going to catch out there?”</p>
 <p>I didn’t give up. I rushed to the door and checked, but no one was around.</p>
 <p>I could only return to my shop. “Why didn't you stop her at that time?”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue answered, “I didn’t dare to. That girl looked a little scary.”</p>
 <p>“Scary? Why?” I was curious.</p>
 <p>“It was broad daylight, but she was holding an umbrella. Moreover, she had a red rope around her neck. That was already creepy enough for me. Although she was pretty, her face was too pale…”</p>
 <p>“She held an umbrella in broad daylight?” I frowned.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue suddenly became tense, as if she had something on her mind. “Wait, don’t tell me that she was a ghost?”</p>
 <p>After seeing Yin Xinyue’s pale face, I comforted her. “We don’t know yet. There’s no need to be scared.”</p>
