 <p>Chuyi took a deep breath and looked at Zen Master Baimei.</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei roared with laughter. “The Night Dragon Bait is a righteous item. It has gotten rid of the Ghost Market. It seems the Night Dragon Bait wasn’t stolen yesterday but rather, it has expelled all the Ghost Market’s participants to protect the villagers! Merciful Buddha, your kindness is boundless!”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was excited and grabbed Zen Master Baimei’s sleeve. “So, the Night Dragon Bait is still in the village?”</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei nodded. “It should be. If we’re lucky, we can borrow the Night Dragon Bait. It’ll be much easier this way…”</p>
 <p>Chuyi also looked happy, as if the weight was lifted off his shoulders.</p>
 <p>Although it was a forced smile, it was a miracle to see him smiling.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go and see the Night Dragon Bait.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, we were really excited. We didn’t think that the situation would change so much overnight.</p>
 <p>We followed Chuyi and got out of the haystack. We headed toward the brick house.</p>
 <p>Yesterday, when the two villagers chatted, we heard a piece of news. The one who found the Night Dragon Bait was a man called ‘Uncle Zhong.’</p>
 <p>When we arrived at Uncle Zhong’s house, we saw a man. He was around fifty years old, and he was chopping some wood in his yard. His tattered radio was playing Zhao Benshan’s performance. I liked this man’s carefree lifestyle.</p>
 <p>After noticing us, the old man dropped his ax and asked, “Who are you looking for?”</p>
 <p>“Good day, sir. We’re travelers. We’ve noticed that your house’s geomancy is extremely good. That’s why we’ve come to see it.” I came up with an excuse.</p>
 <p>“You swindlers,” said the old man. He didn’t appear to have any manners and wanted us to leave.</p>
 <p>I waved my hands immediately. “No, no, sir. Here, this is for you.”</p>
 <p>Then, I took out several one-hundred-renminbi notes and shoved them into his hands. “We don’t have any other requests. We just want to walk around your yard and check out the geomancy.”</p>
 <p>As soon as the old man saw the money, his attitude toward us changed instantly. He smiled. “Well then, go around as you please! I’ve never thought that this shabby house had good geomancy. It’s no wonder that I’m really old and I can still chop up wood and lift water. Young men can’t work as much as I can.”</p>
 <p>I gently smiled at him then walked around his courtyard.</p>
 <p>After taking a look around, I asked, “Sir, have you ever kept a dragon horn here?”</p>
 <p>“A dragon horn? No,” said the old man.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I heard you unearthed it several days ago,” I reminded him.</p>
 <p>The old man had a bewildered face. “What are you talking about? I haven’t worked on my field in days…”</p>
 <p>I was likewise surprised. “Really?”</p>
 <p>The old man swore, “If I’m deceiving you, may I be struck by lightning!”</p>
 <p>I wanted to ask further. However, Chuyi just faintly looked at me and urged, “Let’s go.”</p>
 <p><em>Go? We haven’t seen the Night Dragon Bait yet and we have to go? What does Chuyi have on his mind?</em></p>
 <p>However, Chuyi was really persistent. He forced us to leave.</p>
 <p>When we reached the entrance of the village, he stopped and said, “It’s strange…”</p>
 <p>“What’s strange?” I asked.</p>
 <p>Chuyi explained, “When you guys were talking, I was observing the old man the entire time. He didn’t lie. If you persisted any further, it would have been of no use. Additionally, I sensed and found that the Night Dragon Bait’s aura had disappeared. This village is really odd.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t buy it. I thought that the old man just didn’t want to let us see the Night Dragon Bait.</p>
 <p>Coincidently, a man walked past the village entrance. I knew this man. He was the one who said Uncle Zhong had unearthed a dragon horn yesterday. He must have known something.</p>
 <p>I caught up with him and offered him a cigarette. I smiled. “Good day, sir. We’re from the Cultural Relics Protection Bureau. We’ve heard that you guys have a dragon horn here. That’s why we’ve come to verify the story.”</p>
 <p>He was surprised and looked at me in puzzlement.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. We’re going to take some photos and check it out. We won’t take the item away.”</p>
 <p>The man was even more baffled. “What are you talking about? I don’t understand, brother. What dragon horn? Who did you hear that from? I think you have the wrong place.”</p>
 <p>I turned and looked at Zen Master Baimei and Chuyi. Their faces were dark.</p>
 <p>I felt pressed for time. “Could you think about it more carefully, sir? Uncle Zhong has a dragon horn, right? We just want to check if it’s a real dragon horn. No matter what, it’s a legendary item, right? Everyone is very curious.”</p>
 <p>“Are you crazy?” The villager didn’t know if he should cry or laugh. “Dragon horn? Hah! If we had the dragon horn, we would be rich already. Why would I linger here and chat with you?”</p>
 <p>I could tell that he wasn’t lying, but that made me more anxious. What kind of power could give the entire village amnesia in one night?</p>
 <p>“Do you remember the unusual mist from yesterday?” I asked.</p>
 <p>“Mist? What mist? If you don’t have any business, I need to go now. I have to take care of my wheat.” Then, he started to leave.</p>
 <p>“Wait a minute. Don’t you see something strange here? Where are all the animals in your village?”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” After listening to me, the man was perplexed. He looked at me. “No animals? The animals are gone?”</p>
 <p>He looked bewildered as if he was sleep-talking. He mumbled something then left.</p>
 <p>I was worried and looked at him. The man looked as though he had just been bewitched.</p>
 <p>I went back to Zen Master Baimei. “What happened? Why have all the villagers lost their memories?”</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei sighed. “It’s going to be really difficult to get the Night Dragon Bait. It can control people’s minds and brainwash them. We can’t resist such a powerful force.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi screamed in rage. “I don’t believe it. I must investigate this to the end and find out who has stolen the Night Dragon Bait.”</p>
 <p>I looked at Chuyi. He had a cold expression.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.” Zen Master Baimei waved his hand and said, “We should find a safe place to discuss this matter.”</p>
 <p>Feeling hopeless, we followed Zen Master Baimei.</p>
 <p>This sudden change was much more difficult to deal with than all the otherworldly items I had encountered before.</p>
 <p>However, whether we could take the Night Dragon Bait or not, we had to try!</p>
 <p>Around ten minutes later, we heard people screaming for help in the village. “Guys, hurry! Help! Help! Tie Niu hung himself!”</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei’s face turned gray. “Not good. We must hurry back there. That thing has started to attack the villagers!”</p>
 <p>Then, Zen Master Baimei sped up. We followed closely behind him.</p>
 <p>We saw that many villagers had gathered at the gate of a house, where hung a body. The man’s eyes bulged and were full of fear. His tongue was tucked out, and the corners of his mouth rose as if he was gramacing before he died. His appearance was odd.</p>
 <p>We knew this man. He was the one I had just talked to at the village entrance.</p>
 <p>“Merciful Buddha,” said Zen Master Baimei. He bowed to the corpse then turned around and ushered us to leave.</p>
 <p>“You caused his death…” After leaving the house far enough, Zen Master Baimei suddenly looked at me.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” I was puzzled. “He hung himself. It has nothing to do with me.”</p>
