        })();

 <p>After that case, I didn’t do business for half a year.</p>
 <p>Autumn and winter were off-seasons. Otherworldly items had a habit of ‘hibernating’ which meant they wouldn’t create big commotions. That was why this was also leisure time for me.</p>
 <p>Yet, the Night Dragon Bait was still on my mind. Although Chuyi had told me that everything depended on destiny and chances, how could I stay idle? It was the remedy that could save Chu Chu and the old shaman!</p>
 <p>As I didn’t have anything to do, I drove to remote villages in the mountains to collect local cultural materials.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue often stayed with me as we were now officially a couple. However, I still hadn’t met her parents.</p>
 <p>Every time I mentioned that I should meet her parents, she would find excuses. I wondered what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>I guessed she was worried that her parents wouldn’t like a small antique businessman like me.</p>
 <p>I thought it was time to do some changes. I couldn’t stay in a small, tattered shop forever. It wouldn’t be fair or nice to Yin Xinyue.</p>
 <p>Anyway, since the Night Dragon Bait was some sort of top treasure, it wouldn’t be easy to find. I had spent half a year trying to find information but I still didn’t have any clues…</p>
 <p>Li Mazi and Chu Chu also saw my efforts. Chu Chu had even secretly come over and said to me, “You shouldn’t go out to find that Night Dragon Bait. I know it’s very precious, and I’m afraid that we won’t be able to afford it, even if we do find it.”</p>
 <p>I just smiled. “You shouldn’t be overthinking it. You have to rest well to recover quickly.”</p>
 <p>Eventually, the bitter cold December came, and after the Lunar New Year, I got a valuable clue!</p>
 <p>A rare and strange incident had occurred in a remote village in Sichuan.</p>
 <p>An old man had come back from the dead and he had a ‘Night Pearl’ in his mouth. This Night Pearl didn’t just shine at day time but it also emitted light at night. It was very strange.</p>
 <p>The folks there said that it was the ‘Night Pearl’ Empress Cixi used to have.</p>
 <p>The reason I had got wind of this was my neighbor down the antique street. There was a very enthusiastic Sichuan shop owner who often visited my shop for some chit chat.</p>
 <p>When I got the news, I was really excited. I had a premonition that the shining Night Pearl could somehow be related to the Night Dragon Bait. Perhaps, it was the Night Dragon Bait itself!</p>
 <p>I asked for the address then told Li Mazi that I wanted to go there.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was excited. He wanted to drive his car and travel. However, Chu Chu was bored at home alone and wanted to travel with us to experience new things.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi couldn’t feel at ease if Chu Chu had to stay home alone, so he agreed to take her with us.</p>
 <p>The old shaman had returned to Baisha Village. She enjoyed a quiet life without high waves or strong winds.</p>
 <p>We dressed really warm while traveling. However, the further South we were, the hotter it had become. When we arrived at Sichuan, Li Mazi and I only wore short-sleeved t-shirts and jeans.</p>
 <p>We didn’t expect the weather to be so nice. All the thick, fur coats we had brought along were useless now.</p>
 <p>When we arrived at our destination, Li Mazi and I brought Yin Xinyue and Chu Chu to a hotel in the town. Then, we walked to the mountainous village.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that we didn’t want to drive our car, but the village was sandwiched in the valley and motorbikes were the only vehicles that could reach it.</p>
 <p>I thought it would be too dangerous to ride a motorbike on that steep mountain path. So, we walked up there.</p>
 <p>Sichuan had so many mountains. The road we were walking on was also a difficult journey. We had almost tripped many times. I could only imagine how laborious it was for the people who had worked on the road!</p>
 <p>Eventually, we reached our destination. We made it to Qingshan Village.</p>
 <p>We arrived at Qingshan Village when it was almost night time. I checked my mobile phone and saw that my phone had no signal. I had wanted to call Yin Xinyue to tell her that I was fine.</p>
 <p>We walked into the village and asked about Liu Fuguo, the man who had the Night Pearl in his mouth.</p>
 <p>However, as soon as we mentioned Liu Fuguo, the villagers showed their disdainful faces. They told us that Liu Fuguo had moved out of the village already.</p>
 <p>“Why did he want to move out?” I was a little disappointed.</p>
 <p>A villager coldly waved his hand. “Who are you? Why do you want to know about Liu Fuguo? I don’t know. You should leave.”</p>
 <p>We asked several people and they all showed us indifferent attitudes. They did not seem willing to help.</p>
 <p>I knew Liu Fuguo had done something that had caused people to feel disdain.</p>
 <p>The villagers explicitly expelled us. If we continued to pursue the case, I was afraid that we would enrage them! But if we just left like this, I wouldn’t be satisfied at all. We had traveled all the way and even climbed the mountain to get up here.</p>
 <p>“What should we do?” I asked Li Mazi.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi smiled. “It’s easy.” Then, he took out a lollipop and took me to the entrance of the village and waited.</p>
 <p>Not long after, a group of boys headed toward the village. They hopped and walked happily. It looked like they had just got off school.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi walked forward and stopped the boys. He smiled like a strange uncle. “My little friends, I have some lollipops here. Do you want them?”</p>
 <p>The boys were smart enough. They didn’t take the bait but dismissed Li Mazi and ran away like bees fleeing from a broken hive.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was enraged. After looking at the backs of the kids that ran away, he was so angry he could kill someone. I forced a smile. “It’s not easy to deceive kids nowadays. Their teacher must have told them every day to not talk to strangers. It would be weird if they took your lollipops.”</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, Li Mazi and I had to find a spot to hide in.</p>
 <p>If the folks here didn’t want to tell us, we would have to figure it out ourselves…</p>
 <p>If a man came back alive after being buried, something odd must have happened. As long as we investigated, we were bound to find something.</p>
 <p>I decided to go to the village’s graveyard to check which grave the old man had crawled out of.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, we found the local graveyard. It was on a small mountain. In this area, the burial method was completely different from the Northern area. In the North, they would dig a cave in the mountain flank, put the coffin in, then seal the cave with several flat stones. However, the small tombstones here were much more exquisite than in the North.</p>
 <p>It seemed this mountain was a place to bury people. We saw a lot of graves there. We had to check each of them to find the one we were looking for.</p>
 <p>However, before we were able to check half of the graves, it became completely dark. It was so dark that we couldn’t even see our own fingers.</p>
 <p>It wouldn’t be good to wander around the graveyard late at night. I told Li Mazi to leave. We will come back again tomorrow.</p>
 <p>While leaving, we felt a strange gust of wind blowing behind us.</p>
 <p>I sniffed and was shocked. I recognized the stench of corpses rolling with the wind!</p>
 <p>This shouldn’t be happening because all the graves were sealed tightly in the caves. We had just checked the graveyard and did not find any newly buried corpses.</p>
 <p><em>Where did that corpse stench come from?</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t think much of it. I comforted my nerves and told myself it could be some dead cat or dog. It wasn’t that strange.</p>
 <p>However, I then heard rattling footsteps amidst the wind. Someone was following behind us. They were walking at a calm pace.</p>
 <p>I turned my head and saw a figure descend the stairs. It was around fifty meters away from us and was heading down the mountain.</p>
 <p>It was really late at night and we were in the middle of a graveyard. Why would someone be here? Li Mazi was scared and said, “Is that a walking corpse?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head. “If that was a walking corpse, the corpse couldn't have got out of the sealed grave that easily.”</p>
 <p>We continued to walk and ignored the person that was following us. When we stopped walking, the person had also stopped walking. That person had always kept a certain distance from us.</p>
 <p>A moment later, Li Mazi couldn’t suppress his fear. He turned and screamed at the figure. “Hey, who are you? Why are you following us?”</p>
