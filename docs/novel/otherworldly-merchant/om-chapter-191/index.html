 <p>When we reached the area under the hanging coffin cliff, we walked around with Jiang Jincheng to collect some dried twigs. We burned them and threw all the baskets into the fire.</p>
 <p>The baskets were immediately covered in high flames. A combination of urine, turd, and blood sizzled in the fire. A pungent smell spread alongside the smoke.</p>
 <p>The smoke was green and dispersed the thick fog, eventually filling the entire hanging coffin cliff.</p>
 <p>None of us blinked. We gazed at the cliff and focused on the center because Senior Shu said that the Perpetual Joy Coffin would likely stay in the center of the cliff.</p>
 <p>Not long afterward, a spot in the cliff started to release thick smoke. It looked like a coffin was burning and releasing black smoke. Shortly after, the green smoke in the area subsided.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu called out, “Go! Hurry up! That’s the Perpetual Joy Coffin!”</p>
 <p>Then, he hurried with us to climb up the stairs.</p>
 <p>From the location of the black smoke, the Perpetual Joy Coffin wasn’t in the middle of the hanging coffin cliff. Instead, it was near the stairs.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu scoffed and said, “It’s close to attract more people. If more people come in contact with it, it can steal more karmic reward from them. That’s smart.”</p>
 <p>We went all the way to the middle section of the flank and saw a coffin fuming with black smoke. It was covered entirely in smoke, which hindered us from seeing the coffin itself.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu immediately took out a medium-level spirit talisman and gave it to Jiang Jincheng, askim him to lead the way.</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng didn’t agree. “Why do I have to go first? In case something dangerous happens, I will have to bear it all, right?”</p>
 <p>Senior Shu sneered. “This is a medium-level spirit talisman. It will protect you. And, as you can see, the master of the Perpetual Joy Coffin already knows about us. I’m sure he has already started operating his toxic insects. That’s why you, as the expert, should go first. If you bump into any toxic insect, you will be able to deal with it.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng finally agreed. He took out two ancient, tube-like fire starters and lit them up. After holding them in his hands, he started to climb the cliff.</p>
 <p>We thought we would encounter a large army of insects, but as we crawled near the Perpetual Joy Coffin, we didn’t notice any movements. It looked like an ordinary coffin.</p>
 <p>The abnormal quietness made me more cautious!</p>
 <p>When we stood on the wooden beams that supported the Perpetual Joy Coffin, we restlessly watched Jiang Jincheng and Senior Shu open the lid of the coffin.</p>
 <p>As soon as the lid was lifted up, dark mist exuded from the coffin. I immediately pressed myself against the cliff and closed my eyes. I was worried that the dark mist was poisoned.</p>
 <p>When I opened my eyes again, my vision was much clearer because all the dark mist was gone. Senior Shu and Jiang Jincheng looked at the coffin in bewilderment.</p>
 <p>My curiosity urged me to move forward for a closer look.</p>
 <p>At first glance, I also gawked in awe.</p>
 <p>The corpse wore an official uniform as it lay inside the coffin. An ancient bronze sword on his side sparkled under the sunlight. Also, the body was not rotten. It looked as though he was sleeping, and his stern facial features were enough to intimidate people.</p>
 <p>“His chest, look at his chest!” Li Mazi suddenly screamed.</p>
 <p>Our eyes immediately fell to his chest, and we all dropped our jaws in shock.</p>
 <p>His chest was heaving up and down as if he was breathing. <em>Shoot, is he still alive?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng suddenly got on his knees by the coffin and said gingerly, “He is the Miao King!”</p>
 <p>“Miao King?” I looked at Senior Shu with doubts in my mind. “Who’s this Miao King?”</p>
 <p>“In ancient times, the leader of the Miao Area was chosen by the Emperor of the Great Ming dynasty, who granted him land and an official robe.”</p>
 <p>“Jiang Jincheng, don’t be scared. He is dead already. You should kill his life-bound poisonous insect now,” Senior Shu told him.</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng was still scared. “No, he was once the Miao King, and I’m a member of the Miao tribe. I can’t kill him.”</p>
 <p>"Okay.” Senior Shu agreed, to my surprise. “However, let me tell you that you’re not being filial this way as you’re allowing this guy to absorb your father’s karmic reward, making your father unable be able to reincarnate. In addition, the Miao King has no blood relation with you, are you really willing to let him continue with his evil deeds?”</p>
 <p>“I... I…” Jiang Jincheng was bewildered. He hesitated.</p>
 <p>“Hurry up,” said Senior Shu. “If we wait and his life-bound poisonous insect comes out, we’ll all die. I think you know this better than we do.”</p>
 <p>Eventually, Jiang Jincheng gritted his teeth. “Damn, this damn Miao King is really cruel and merciless. Today, I will eradicate this source of evil for our Miao people!”</p>
 <p>Then, Jiang Jincheng squeezed the king’s mouth open.</p>
 <p>The insides of the mouth were dried out and shriveled. Only the outside of his body looked fresh.</p>
 <p>Also, his chest was moving due to the life-bound poisonous insect hiding there. Since his life-bound poisonous insect was living in his chest, it made his chest move up and down.</p>
 <p>After he pried the Miao King’s mouth open, Jiang Jincheng immediately shoved the fire igniter inside, which caused his chest to heave stronger.</p>
 <p>However, it was strange that the smoke from the igniter all disappeared into the Miao King’s throat. Nothing came out.</p>
 <p>Senior Shu watched and exclaimed repeatedly, “It’s not easy to reach this level of heat control. Not bad, not bad.”</p>
 <p>The igniter continued to burn until it receded around the Miao King’s lips. Then, it stopped burning and was taken out by Jiang Jincheng.</p>
 <p>As soon as the igniter was taken out, thick smoke started to fume from the king’s mouth and nostrils.</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng became more anxious. He pinched both of his hands together and waited near the Miao King’s nose and mouth, ready to make his move at any time.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for me to understand the situation, I suddenly heard a buzzing sound coming from the Miao King’s throat.</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng concentrated. I knew that the Miao King’s life-bound poisonous insect was about to come out and that Jiang Jincheng wanted to use his hands to grab it. I was looking forward to seeing his marvelous hand technique in action!</p>
 <p>While my mind wandered around, the Miao King’s mouth closed and Jiang Jincheng screamed, “Shoot, not good!” He wanted to retract his hands.</p>
 <p>However, it was too late. A black insect as big as a fly flew out of the Miao King’s nose. It immediately bit Jiang Jincheng’s hand.</p>
 <p>Jiang Jincheng shrieked and jerked his hand back. If it weren’t for Senior Shu having fast reflexes and catching him, he would have fallen down the high cliff.</p>
 <p>I glanced at Jiang Jincheng’s hand. It was just a small bite, and it had bled only a little bit.</p>
 <p>However, Jiang Jincheng continued to whine and scream in pain. He grabbed his wrist tightly with his other hand and said to Senior Shu, “Senior Shu, please help me chop this hand off!”</p>
 <p><em>What?</em></p>
 <p>Li Mazi and I were dumbstruck. We didn’t know if Jiang Jincheng was kidding or if he was being serious!</p>
