 <p>After entering the bedroom, Lei Long placed the white ribbon flower on the table. Following the ancient customs, he sat at the table and poured two wine cups. “W-Wife, we should drink the wedding wine. Shall we?”</p>
 <p>After that, Lei Long suddenly remembered something. He fumbled and took out a willow twig from underneath the table. He dipped it in the wine to sprinkle it in the air.</p>
 <p>We couldn’t see the ghost bride through the monitor, since cameras weren’t as excellent as human eyes, and their working principles were different. I was only able to see the cup being lifted by some invisible person who also drank the wine.</p>
 <p>Immediately after, a shadow became discernible in the monitor. I had tampered with the willow twig and grafted a piece of peach wood on to it. The willow twig helped the ghost drink the wine, and the peach wood piece made her visible.</p>
 <p>Lei Long certainly had a better view of the ghost thanks to this. He was definitely scared as the hand holding the cup was shaking. However, he still managed to control himself and drink the wine in one go.</p>
 <p>Lei Long behaved like a newlywed bride, sitting gingerly on the bed. “Wife, it’s late. We should rest.” The dark shadow was wiggling, seemingly due to nervousness. She carefully crawled onto the bed to lie down.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi rubbed his hands excitedly and said, “It’s going to start. It’s really going to start! Holy crap!”</p>
 <p>After lying next to a moldy woman, Lei Long would surely get traumatized. We wondered if his manhood would rise ever again once this strange experience was over.</p>
 <p>The woman raised her hand to pull Lei Long’s arm, inviting him to lay down; Lei Long had to go with the flow. The shadow then climbed on top of him, trying to remove his clothes.</p>
 <p>However, Lei Long seemed to have remembered something again. He hurried to stop her. “Oh, right. Honey, I’ve got a small gift for you.” Then, he clumsily rolled off the bed and took out the Peach Soul Flower from underneath their bed. “Wife, this is for you.”</p>
 <p>The woman acted bashfully. I guessed she felt the gesture was sweet. Sheepishly, she raised her hand and received the Peach Soul Flower. She drew it close to observe it.</p>
 <p>“Run!” I shouted the order through the speaker. As soon as he heard my voice, Lei Long rushed out of the room without hesitating.</p>
 <p>The ghost was startled. She got off the bed and tried to chase after him.</p>
 <p>I practically flew out of the bathroom, immediately sticking the talisman on the door and closing it right after Lei Long had left the bedroom. The talisman was activated when the ghost bride touched the door, releasing a strong, 卐-shaped light. <span style="background-color: rgba(230, 236, 249, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>The ghost bride was frightened. She howled since she was aware that she had been trapped. I felt a tinge of pity after hearing her cries.</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to be confined in the room, and she charged at the door again and again. The talisman didn’t work well this time. It still released a golden light, but it was much weaker. It failed to block the ghost and began to consume itself.</p>
 <p>The ghost bride lunged toward the living room, shouting and sobbing. “Husband, where are you?”</p>
 <p>She immediately turned around and flew toward us when she noticed our Yang energy in the bathroom. However, the Peach Soul Flower activated before she reached us. I could clearly see how the flower started to glow, exuding a supple aura that covered the ghost bride.</p>
 <p>She was frightened. The strong Yang energy from the Peach Soul Flower made her stumble and fall. She wanted to throw the flower away, but how could she do so after touching it? No matter how she struggled, the flower didn’t let her go. The vigorous Yang energy created a tornado. It twirled fiercely, tearing and devouring her.</p>
 <p>The woman screamed in fright. She began to disappear bit by bit, starting from her legs, as her body was devoured by the Yang energy.</p>
 <p>While she was being swallowed, her appearance began to change. Her body was no longer moldy, and the spots on her face disappeared, revealing her soft and creamy skin. When the mold was completely gone, only her naked upper body remained. We all gawked in shock when we saw her real face!</p>
 <p>The woman possessed features that could turn a country upside down. Her skin was like jade, her face like a flower blossom. There was a touch of seduction in her eyes, and her cherry lips were slightly parted. Although she was frowning in pain, her appearance inspired great pity.</p>
 <p>Unshed tears lingered in her eyes; her voice rose with a heartrending plea, unlike the former wolf-like howling. “Husband, husband, save me!”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi couldn’t help but sigh. “Do you think we went overboard?”</p>
 <p>A soul was also a life. Even though she was hostile, it hurt us to smite her soul and make her vanish forever.<em>&nbsp;</em> However, I knew she wouldn’t last long even if I tried to save her; her soul would perish eventually. It would be better to give her a quick death.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi said, “It seems she has some last words to say. Let her speak.”</p>
 <p>I nodded. She didn’t pose a threat to us anymore since only a few wisps of her soul remained. I strode toward her and snatched away the flower.</p>
 <p>The fierce tornado vanished shortly after. The woman lay flat on the ground; her figure was semi-transparent. As the soul wasn’t a physical entity, she wouldn’t appear in a dismembered state.</p>
 <p>The woman was about to perish, and she started to shed tears.</p>
 <p>“My fate was so miserable.” The woman gently sobbed. “Why did you treat me like that? Why?”</p>
 <p>“Do you have something to say?” I snorted and added, “Say your last words if you have any.”</p>
 <p>“Last words?” The woman sneered and replied, “You woke me up, and now you want my soul to vanish. I just wanted to fill my stomach. Why did you do that to me?”</p>
 <p>I answered, “You shouldn’t have hurt people! This is retribution!”</p>
 <p>“Retribution? Hahaha!”</p>
 <p>The woman said, “Why would there be retribution coming my way? I just wanted to save them. He’s going to die, and his time is nearing. I gave him a chance, but you didn’t appreciate my gift…”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” I furrowed my eyebrows since I didn’t understand.</p>
 <p>The woman just looked at me and said no more; her dejected face was filled with tears.</p>
 <p>Soon, she turned into smoke and dispersed. I exhaled in relief, but my heart was filled with doubts. <em>What did she mean?</em></p>
 <p>Lei Long came out of the bedroom. He became anxious after seeing the empty living room.</p>
 <p>“Grandmaster, what happened? Is she gone?”</p>
 <p>I nodded, my eyes assessing Lei Long from head to toe. I didn’t find anything unusual, so I found the wine left by the ghost bride and smeared the liquid over my eyes. Afterward, I continued to observe Lei Long.</p>
