 <p>Qin Yu was quarrelling with a woman, and it was again related to San Bao. He was accusing her of committing adultery with San Bao to trick him out of his money.</p>
 <p>Some people who were also spending the night on the beach had surrounded them and were watching the fun. I felt embarrassed as I forced myself into the crowd. <em>What the heck is Qin Yu doing over there?&nbsp;</em> Once I got there, I found a young woman wearing a bikini standing in front of Qin Yu. I had to admit that she was hot. Even though she was around thirty years old, her skin was as smooth as that of a girl in her twenties. She was very pleasing to the eye.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi rushed in and said, “Ah Yan, what are you doing here?”</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was angry and in tears, but she had no strength to snap back due to Qin Yu’s continuous scolding and yelling.</p>
 <p>She was excited to see Li Mazi. She ran to him, asking for help.</p>
 <p>“What happened?” asked Li Mazi.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan told him what was going on.</p>
 <p>After they graduated, she decided to marry Qin Yu as she loved his kindness and loyalty. She felt that he was a smart and responsible man.</p>
 <p>Throughout the years, Qin Yu continued treating Ah Yan well, burrowing deeper and deeper into her heart.</p>
 <p>However, things changed ever since Qin Yu got a jade belt. He would spend the whole day looking at it, without eating or sleeping. He didn’t even want to leave the house; he was bewitched by it.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan had thought that it was just a passing phase, so she didn’t really pay attention to it. However, one day, the jade belt disappeared, which left Qin Yu in an extremely odd state. He seemed to have become another man.</p>
 <p>Before that incident, Qin Yu had always been a generous, caring, and family-oriented man. However, he became overly suspicious ever since the jade belt disappeared. He thought that everyone around him wanted to harm him and that someone close to him had stolen the belt.</p>
 <p>That was why he quarrelled with San Bao, his best friend, and wanted to divorce Ah Yan.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan found it weird because their love was still strong. She thought it might be because Qin Yu was stressed at work. As such, she decided to take him on vacation to release his stress.</p>
 <p>However, they started quarrelling halfway to their destination. Qin Yu accused her of having an affair with San Bao. He suspected that they wanted to steal all of his property.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was so angry that she left right away; she decided to continue the trip on her own. Although it was going to be lonely, she didn’t want to waste all the tickets and reservations she’d made in Sanya.</p>
 <p>However, Qin Yu had been stalking her, and he caught up with her at some point and asked if she remembered Li Mazi and whether she was still in touch with him.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan didn’t know why he suddenly asked those questions, but she told him the truth. She remembered Li Mazi, and she thought that he was a guy.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was also considering Qin Yu’s current state, and she didn’t want him to lose another friend. She hoped he could pull himself together.</p>
 <p>To her surprise, Qin Yu was furious after hearing her answer. They quarrelled again, and he accused her of having an affair with San Bao and then with Li Mazi.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan felt wronged. After all, she hadn’t even met Li Mazi! She was disappointed by how little Qin Yu trusted her.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was so angry that even his body was shaking. He asked Ah Yan to wait as he strode toward Qin Yu. Without a bit of hesitation, he started to punch and kick the man.</p>
 <p>“You bastard! Ah Yan was the prettiest girl in our school, and many men wanted to marry her. We entrusted her to you, and you’re treating our goddess this way?! I’ll give you a good lesson tonight!”</p>
 <p>Qin Yu wasn’t Li Mazi’s match, and he was beaten black and blue.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was worried about Qin Yu. She rushed forward to stop Li Mazi. “Please stop! I think Qin Yu is just too stressed because of work. Stop fighting, and let’s talk.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi fumed, “This scumbag doesn’t deserve you! You should leave him for good!”</p>
 <p>Qin Yu jolted up from the ground, shouting curses at Li Mazi, but decided to run away when he saw that Li Mazi was about to hit him again.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi then returned to comfort Ah Yan. Since they were old friends and they hadn’t seen each other for quite a long time, they sat down and had a good talk.</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was beautiful and sexy, and she looked really attractive in her bikini. I was worried that Li Mazi would be tempted, so I stayed to keep an eye on them.</p>
 <p>Ru Xue was mad and wished to drag Li Mazi away, but I blinked at her, signaling her not to think too much of it.</p>
 <p>As expected, Ah Yan’s impression of Li Mazi had improved quite a lot. Since the woman was lonely and Li Mazi had saved her like a hero, she put him on a pedestal in her mind; she even invited him to tour around Sanya with her.</p>
 <p>I suspected that they might really get together if they toured together.</p>
 <p>Ru Xue was perhaps prettier than Ah Yan, but if we talked about friendship and charm, Ah Yan had the upper hand.</p>
 <p>I was tense while waiting for Li Mazi’s answer to the invitation. If this fellow dared to betray Ru Xue, I would have to give him a lesson.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi wore an apologetic face. “I’m sorry. I’m already married.”</p>
 <p>Then, he turned to look at Ru Xue. “Honey, come and greet your sister.”</p>
 <p>Ru Xue’s face immediately brightened. She ran forward and sweetly greeting Ah Yan, “Good evening, sister. I’m Li Mazi’s wife.”</p>
 <p>Ah Yan was a friendly person. She smiled at Li Mazi and said, “It must be the karmic reward from your ancestor. Your wife is young and beautiful; you should treat her well.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi laughed. “Don’t worry! I’m not like Qin Yu, who didn’t treasure the beauty in his house.”</p>
 <p>After bidding their farewells, Li Mazi returned to the tent. Ru Xue looked at him with a sweet expression on her face, completely infatuated.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi took out a cigarette. After looking at him, I was pretty sure he was thinking about Qin Yu.</p>
 <p>I helplessly looked at him. “Do you really want to meddle with this matter?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi calmly looked back at me and nodded. “I have a feeling that Qin Yu’s sudden change isn’t normal. I think something is affecting him.”</p>
 <p>“You should think about it carefully. We’re here to enjoy a vacation, and Qin Yu isn’t going to appreciate your help. It’ll be a thankless job.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi forced a smile. “I have no choice, my fault for being too righteous. Anyway, I think the jade belt might be causing all this. It could be an otherworldly item!”</p>
 <p>I helplessly shook my head. “All right. If you want to help, I can’t just stand by and watch.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi smiled and patted my shoulder. “I knew you wouldn’t let me do this alone. Our friendship isn’t that shallow.”</p>
 <p>Then, Li Mazi called San Bao. He wanted to know more about the situation.</p>
 <p>A hoarse voice came from the other end of the line. “Li Mazi, how are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi said, “Okay, I guess. I saw Qin Yu today. What happened between you guys?”</p>
 <p>San Bao said in a frustrated tone, “Qin Yu’s changed. Take my advice, don’t get close to him. I used to treat him like a brother, but according to him, it was only because I wanted his money. He also suspects that I’ve stolen his jade belt. I was really blind, how could I not figure out what kind of person he was?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi comforted him, “San Bao, do you really think that Qin Yu is that sort of despicable man?”</p>
 <p>San Bao answered, “In the past, I would have never thought of Qin Yu that way. But now, it’s different. He even told me that he never wants to see me again.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi smiled. “San Bao, let me ask you something. If you’re a true friend, shouldn’t you lend a hand and be forgiving when your friend is in trouble?”</p>
 <p>San Bao took a deep breath. “It’s easy for you to say as you’re not involved! That guy is too much to bear! And, who told you that he’s in trouble? I’m telling you, he’s changed!”</p>
 <p>“If I told you that Qin Yu did all those things because he had no control of his actions, would you forgive him?”</p>
 <p>San Bao kept silent for a moment then asked nervously, “What do you mean? Does he have some deadly disease, or did he commit some crime he doesn’t want me to know about? Actually, it might be possible. It would explain why he changed so much.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi laughed. “I think you have watched too many Korean dramas. How did you even come up with such thoughts? Anyway, it’s complicated. You should make arrangements to join us in Hainan. We can speak in detail when you get here.”</p>
 <p>San Bao agreed.</p>
 <p>After hanging up the phone, Li Mazi turned to me and asked, “Do you have any idea?”</p>
 <p>“I haven’t even seen that jade belt yet, how could I have a plan? Still, it’s easy to see if he’s being pestered by an otherworldly item.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, how?” Li Mazi asked.</p>
 <p>“Can you find Qin Yu?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi nodded. “He should also be spending the night on the beach. I think I can find him.”</p>
 <p>“Very well,” I said. “You should take a bottle of sea water and pour it over Qin Yu’s tent. Then, buy an eel and smear its blood on his tent as well. Tomorrow, I will be able to tell if that jade belt is an otherworldly item and whether it has affected him.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi nodded and left.</p>
