 <p>“You guys can’t proactively go near him. We don’t want to provoke him. We just want him to notice you. Then, if he likes some of you, he might talk to you and tell you his story.”</p>
 <p>The red-haired girl said helplessly, “What do we do then? If you want me to strip and tempt him, you’ll have to pay me.”</p>
 <p>Her words startled me, and I hurried to say, “You girls should go by the window. Sing or play some games. Just try to be lively and eye-catching. We need to create some noise.”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue wore a wry smile. “It’s really hard to please this ghost. Ladies, listen to him.”</p>
 <p>Then, Yin Xinyue led the group out of the house. The other ladies complained but still followed behind her.</p>
 <p>At first, the girls played the game, ‘The Eagle Catches the Chickens.’ When they got tired, they began to sing. However, Mr. Qi looked indifferent the entire time and didn’t bat an eye. In the end, he was annoyed and snapped.</p>
 <p>He stormed towards the window and scolded the girls. “Your singing is terrible! You are vixens who will harm this country!”</p>
 <p>I started to wonder if the soul possessing Mr. Qi was gay.<em>&nbsp;</em>These girls could charm any man, but this soul was unmoved and even annoyed by their presence.</p>
 <p>I was worried that the girls would anger him further. As such, I had to ask them to stop.</p>
 <p>The red-haired girl was mad. “Mr. Zhang, what’s wrong with that guy? Is he gay or something? He’s too hateful. I don’t want to do this anymore!”</p>
 <p>Then, the red-haired girl wanted to change back into her normal clothes.</p>
 <p>The other girls also complained and wanted to give up. “We are tired. What kind of ghost is that? It’s not fun at all.”</p>
 <p>I felt helpless. If this approach didn’t work, we’d have to play hard.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi said, “Why don’t you let me give it a try?”</p>
 <p>I looked at Li Mazi in puzzlement. “What do you want to do?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi said, “What if he really liked men? Let me try. Perhaps I can convince him.”</p>
 <p>I burst out laughing until my stomach ached. How did Li Mazi come up with such a stupid idea?</p>
 <p>“I don’t think he likes men. Don’t you see that he keeps on drawing a woman? I guess he’s just a sentimental lover who is too faithful to the woman in his drawings. He has no interest in other women.”</p>
 <p>As soon as I said that, Mr. Qi lifted the picture he had just drawn. It was again a bathing beauty. He seemed to be satisfied with this drawing.</p>
 <p>He wore a faint smile and said, “Ordinary water can’t impress me as I've seen the vast sea;&nbsp;having seen the majestic Mount Wu, ordinary clouds no longer please me.”</p>
 <p>The girls were bewildered. “What does he mean by that?”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue said, “What else could he mean? He means that we’re uglier than the girl in his drawings. As he’s seen that woman, no other woman can tempt him.”</p>
 <p>“He’s crazy!” fumed the red-haired girl.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue was also irritated. “Hmph, he’s still a man in the end. Let me show him my power.”</p>
 <p>Then, she walked towards Mr. Qi.</p>
 <p>I reached out my hand to stop her, but she had already run off.</p>
 <p>Her sudden action scared the heck out of me. Instinctively, I stormed forward in an attempt to protect Yin Xinyue. In the worst-case scenario, we could just fight the ghost directly.</p>
 <p>However, Li Mazi stopped me. “You should know Yin Xinyue by now. She wouldn’t act if she didn’t have a plan. Just wait and see. Actually, I’m curious to see what she wants to do.”</p>
 <p>But I was still worried. How could I just stand and watch as she put herself in danger? Li Mazi hooked his arm to mine and pulled me back. I couldn’t get rid of him, so I could only worriedly watch Yin Xinyue.</p>
 <p>“Good evening, sir. Could you please show me your new drawing?” When Yin Xinyue faced the ghost, she didn’t sound scared. Her voice was gentle, just as if she was chatting with a friend.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qi shot her a disdainful glance. “You’re just an entertainer. How could you understand painting and calligraphy?”</p>
 <p>“That might not be the case!” Yin Xinyue sounded angry when the man looked down on her skills. She snatched the drawing to look at it.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!” Mr. Qi was enraged and slapped the table. “Put it down. Don’t stain my drawing!”</p>
 <p>Then, he reached out his hand to snatch the drawing back.</p>
 <p>I was scared and started sweating. <em>What is she doing? Does she not want to live anymore?!</em></p>
 <p>I pushed Li Mazi’s arm aside and stormed forward.</p>
 <p>“It’s a good painting, with smooth curves. It looks realistic, but her face shows no expression. What a shame.” Yin Xinyue sighed.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qi was bewildered and looked at Yin Xinyue. “You know how to paint?”</p>
 <p>“A little bit.” Yin Xinyue smiled then picked up the weasel fur brush. She spread a sheet of paper on the table and started to draw.</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue seemed to have mastered Chinese drawing techniques. Her brush moved like a snake that left streaks on the Xuan paper. Although it looked like a mess, when everything was connected, the result was wonderful.</p>
 <p>Soon after, an ancient beauty appeared on her paper.</p>
 <p>At last, she carefully painted the girl’s eyes. Immediately, the spiritless woman looked as if she had come to life. Her eyes were now full of emotions. She looked sad and lonely…</p>
 <p>I gawked in shock. I never knew that Yin Xinyue had such talents. I had underestimated her.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qi was also stunned as he gazed at the beauty in the drawing. He carefully lifted the drawing and admired it.</p>
 <p>After a while, he appraised it and smacked his tongue. “I cannot believe there’s a talented woman like you in this world. It’s really rare.”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue wore a faint smile but refused to express her opinion.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qi was lost in the drawing. His finger gently caressed the woman’s face. He looked very sentimental.</p>
 <p>Then, he brought the drawing to his chest and hugged it, starting to cry. “Unfortunately, I’m dead already. I hate the heavens for not allowing us to be together!”</p>
 <p>I gently exhaled. Mr. Qi was finally willing to open up his heart and talk.</p>
 <p>I winked at Yin Xinyue. Feeling content, she gestured an OK at me. Then, she swayed her head to one side and said to Mr. Qi, “Sir, would you tell me the sorrow you’ve been bearing for so long?”</p>
 <p>Mr. Qi looked up at Yin Xinyue. “All right. It’s rare to meet such a talented girl like you.”</p>
 <p>Then, Yin Xinyue shut the door of the study room.</p>
 <p>I gawked and raised my brows, feeling jealous.</p>
 <p>I wanted to go there and have a ‘group chat,’ but Li Mazi stopped me. “Can’t you see what’s happening? He’s a righteous man. He won’t do anything to Yin Xinyue. Don’t worry.”</p>
 <p>Although I knew that, I still felt a little jealous as if I was being cheated on.</p>
 <p>At the same time, I knew it wasn’t a bright decision to storm in there. Begrudgingly, I had to wait outside.</p>
 <p>I had waited nervously at the door for the whole night, but Yin Xinyue hadn’t come out yet. If Yin Xinyue hadn’t sent me text messages from time to time to show that she was safe, I would have kicked the door open already.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi and the others couldn’t stand feeling bored. They all found a place to rest or sleep.</p>
 <p>I was the only one who waited like that until the break of dawn. Then, I heard something fall from the room, just as if someone had tripped. My nerves went tense, and I quickly got up.</p>
 <p>Before I could reach the door, it was pushed open from inside. Yin Xinyue walked out. She had dark circles under her eyes, but she looked excited and lively. She smiled at me. “I’ve suddenly realized that you’re somewhat shallow, vulgar, and ignorant…”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but smile. I poked my head into the room and asked, “Where’s Mr. Qi?”</p>
 <p>“He’s sleeping,” Yin Xinyue answered. “He’s sleeping under the table.”</p>
 <p>I heaved a sigh of relief then grabbed Yin Xinyue’s hand. I checked her from head to toe. “Xinyue, did he hurt you?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry,” said Yin Xinyue. “He’s a real gentleman. He wouldn’t do that.”</p>
 <p>“Did you get to know his story?”</p>
 <p>Yin Xinyue’s bright expression dimmed. “Yeah, I did. He’s the most sentimental lover in this world! He’s been waiting for the love of his life for thousands of years…”</p>
