        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p>Although this otherworldly item had been improved with some evil spell, to maintain its effect, the caster had to chant the spell once a day. So, today, this person would come again to chant the spell!</p>
 <p>We could capture that person when the time came…</p>
 <p>I asked Chuyi, “What does this little bronze tripod do? How could it affect me? Is there a story behind the item?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi was not familiar with the item, and its effect on me was enough to trouble him; he could sense this just by giving a quick glance at the small brass tripod.</p>
 <p>After we came up with a plan, I placed the small bronze tripod back to its original spot, trying to make it look as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei asked me to help them find a place to hide. They also told me to not tell anybody that they had visited. Otherwise, I would alert the enemy.</p>
 <p>I nodded and led them to the guest rooms to rest. It was highly unlikely that enemies would come for me in broad daylight.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi arrived not long after. He yawned, clutching a bottle of wine. He sat on the table, with a leg crossed over his knee. “Why do you need to see me this early in the morning?”</p>
 <p>I didn’t tell Li Mazi about the paranormal activity I’d experienced the day before. Although I trusted him, his mouth wasn’t tight. There would be big trouble if he blurted it out.</p>
 <p>I acted as if nothing had happened. “I don’t have change and I’m too lazy to get some. Can you buy me something to eat?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi didn’t care about the money and threw several hundred renminbi at me. “I pay, you go! Buy some food that goes well with wine! I’ve been holding back for days.”</p>
 <p>I teased him. “What? You haven’t gotten married and your wife is already controlling you? You don’t dare to drink in your house?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi sighed, “Haiz! I had a fight with Chu Chu. I don’t dare to drink liquor under her watch.”</p>
 <p>Chu Chu was the young widow Li Mazi had brought back.</p>
 <p>“All right, keep an eye on my shop. I’m going to buy some spicy duck necks. You can enjoy drinking as much as you want today,” I told him.</p>
 <p>Then I left in a hurry. Fearing that Li Mazi would stumble upon Zen Master Baimei and Chuyi, I bought some cooked food nearby and returned quickly.</p>
 <p>However, I didn’t expect that Li Mazi would vomit so much after just three rounds of wine. I shooed him away, demanding him to take his vomiting home.</p>
 <p>Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei hadn’t had lunch yet and I was keeping them in the guest rooms while we were drinking outside. It was really embarrassing.</p>
 <p>After Li Mazi left, Zen Master Baimei walked out of the guest room. He looked at Li Mazi’s receding figure for a while. He asked, “Benefactor, is that man very close to you?”</p>
 <p>I nodded repeatedly. “Yeah, my close friend. What about him?”</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei went to see Li Mazi’s leftover vomit. He observed it for a while and nodded pensively.</p>
 <p>I found it strange. “Zen Master, have you found something?”</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei didn’t want to discuss it. He waved his hand. “We’ll see tonight! I can’t verify my assumption right now.”</p>
 <p>My heart thumped faster. What if Li Mazi was plagued by the same problem?</p>
 <p>Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei were already troubled because of me. If Li Mazi was also added to the mix, would they be able to deal with it?</p>
 <p>I knew they wouldn’t answer me, even if I asked. One acted mysterious and the other showed a cold face. This duet was really odd…</p>
 <p>The sun set in the West, sending a golden afterglow to my shop. Zen Master Baimei brewed a teapot; he leaned against a chair, then he closed his eyes as though he was trying to find serenity. On the other hand, Chuyi simply held his sword with an absent-minded look while I cleaned my shop.</p>
 <p>This scene looked amusing; I felt as if I were watching a Hollywood movie. Two powerful, intimidating bosses helping a poor little boy to claim his throne…</p>
 <p>I had already bought some vegetarian food so I ate with them. Then, I went to bed as they had requested. Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei followed me and hid in the closet.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t sleep, knowing that two people were watching me. I just lay on my bed and played with my phone. However, someone knocked on my door not long after.</p>
 <p><em>Who’s the bastard knocking at my door this late?</em></p>
 <p>I couldn’t do anything but answer the door. I was enraged after seeing Li Mazi standing at my door, wearing his honest and smiling face. “It’s almost midnight. Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi snorted. “Your shop opens every night, doesn’t it? Why did you close tonight?”</p>
 <p>“Are you blind? Didn’t you see the sign that says ‘closed for one night’?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi suddenly saw the light. He laughed in embarrassment. “Well, well, well, are you hiding some beauty in your house? I need to check it out.” I became restless as soon as I heard his reply. <em>Is there anything wrong with Li Mazi? Why didn’t he come earlier? Why does he have to be here right now?</em></p>
 <p>Since he was implying I was hiding some beauty, he had to know that Chuyi and Zen Master Baimei were there.</p>
 <p>However, I was still calm. “I’m tired, so I want to sleep early. Can you not bother me?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi simply charged into my shop without a word. “Drink with me. It’s really hard to get out these days, you know.”</p>
 <p>I was helpless. Li Mazi was like a mangy dog that I just couldn’t shoo away; I had to sit down and drink with him.</p>
 <p>However, before I could even take a sip, I heard the ‘Merciful Buddha’ chant from the bedroom.</p>
 <p><em>Damn, what the heck is Zen Master Baimei doing? He’s giving himself away!</em></p>
 <p>Li Mazi was startled. “Somebody’s in your room!”</p>
 <p>Before he finished talking, I saw a silhouette dashing into my room. However, Chuyi was as fast as lightning and managed to intercept that silhouette.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi rolled his eyes and yelled at me. “Since when is Chuyi staying here? You little bastard, you deceived me. Stop. Stop, don’t fight!”</p>
 <p>I was enraged. <em>This bastard Li Mazi was plotting something. I’m sure he brought that person here! Is he the one scheming against me?!</em></p>
 <p>I couldn’t control my rage, so I lunged forward and pinned him to the ground. “Bastard, I thought you were my brother, but you’re trying to harm me!”</p>
 <p>“Hey, it’s a misunderstanding. Chu Chu said that you provoked some strange thing. I’m here to save you…” Li Mazi groaned.</p>
 <p>“That’s Chu Chu?” I asked.</p>
 <p>"What would I gain by deceiving you?”</p>
 <p>I loosened my grip on Li Mazi, then I rushed to find Chuyi. He had already subdued the silhouette and taken off her veil. Indeed, it was the young widow, Chu Chu.</p>
 <p>Chu Chu was looking at Chuyi with unveiled surprise. It seemed she hadn’t thought that the man could be this agile.</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei approached them, while he spoke with a merciful tone. “Female Benefactor, if you don’t mind my asking, are you related to Grannie Linglong?”</p>
 <p>“How do you know my mother’s name?” Chu Chu was alarmed.</p>
 <p>Zen Master Baimei was astonished. “What? Grannie Linglong has children? She ended up with that dumb farmer?”</p>
 <p>“What the heck you are talking about?” Chu Chu wiggled out of Chuyi’s restraint. “My father wasn’t a dumb farmer! Who are you? How come you know my mother’s name?”</p>
 <p>“Before he became a monk, he used to chase after Grannie Linglong,” Chuyi answered with a cold tone.</p>
 <p>His words were like a bomb exploding in the room, leaving everyone speechless.</p>
 <p>Chu Chu was quiet, gawking at Zen Master Baimei in shock.</p>
 <p>The Zen Master blushed for a moment. His hand holding the mala beads shivered as he pointed at Chuyi. He was unhappy since he had revealed a part of his past.</p>
 <p>I didn’t think that Zen Master Baimei, a true master who looked like a senior monk, would have such passionate past.</p>
 <p>All masters seemed to be like this, as if they didn’t care about trivial matters. These details only made Zen Master Baimei more interesting</p>
 <p>I knew it was a misunderstanding, I asked them to sit and talk.</p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em>It turned out that Chu Chu had come to the antique shop just to help me.</p>
 <p>Chu Chu knew ghost doctor techniques, so I didn’t doubt her. And, Zen Master Baimei and Chuyi had also proven that Chu Chu didn’t chant any Thai spells in my bedroom. She just wanted to find the cause but not to harm me.</p>
 <p>I was puzzled. How did Chu Chu know that I had been affected by something?</p>
 <p>Under my continuous urge, Li Mazi eventually told me the truth.</p>
