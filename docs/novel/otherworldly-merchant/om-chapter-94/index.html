 <p>It was a funeral hall!</p>
 <p>The lights from the candles flickered, setting off an atmosphere of sadness.</p>
 <p>At this moment, I saw Liu Rushi lying inside a red wooden coffin.</p>
 <p>The unrivaled, talented beauty was now just a cold corpse.</p>
 <p>Her face was wrinkled and her skin was pale. She didn’t glow anymore. There were two dark circles under her eyes, which made her look like a woman in her thirties. Her bloodied eyes made me feel afraid.</p>
 <p>Although my fear had reached the pinnacle, I tried to suppress it. I told myself to stay calm. Otherwise, I could die here.</p>
 <p>“Are you… scared?” asked Liu Rushi.</p>
 <p>Her lips didn’t move and she didn’t blink. Her hoarse voice came deep from her throat, making me shudder.</p>
 <p>“No, I’m not.” I took a deep breath then said, “We’ll live and grow old together until our hair turns white. That was my promise to you, and I’m planning to fulfill it now. Actually, how about we go together? On our way to the afterworld, I can take care of you.”</p>
 <p>Her body shook violently. Tears lingered in her eyes. “You… you really won’t leave me?”</p>
 <p>“No, I won’t.” I smiled and wiped her tears. “I still want to be with you in our next lives.”</p>
 <p>She sighed then burst out crying.</p>
 <p>Her appearance changed back. She was now mesmerizingly beautiful. The funeral hall gradually turned into the scene of a brothel.</p>
 <p>“You should leave,” she said. “I’m not worthy of your love. It’s enough for me to know your love and thoughts of me.”</p>
 <p>Liu Rushi sat on her bed and looked through her window. Faint sorrow clouded her eyes.</p>
 <p>“No, you’re really good,” I told her. “Come with me! Leave this place. There’s no love here. Let’s go to a place you truly belong.”</p>
 <p>“Can… can I really?” She cooed. “But where?”</p>
 <p>“Give me your hand.” I smiled. “Come with me. I will take you with me.”</p>
 <p>She felt very touched and looked at me. She then gave me a slight nod.</p>
 <p>I held her hand and walked East as Chuyi had instructed me to.</p>
 <p>She followed closely behind me and held onto my hand tightly. Her eyes never left me even for a moment. She was afraid that I would disappear if she blinked.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know how long we had walked until I heard the mysterious man’s voice.</p>
 <p>When I opened my eyes, I found myself lying under the quilt. My entire body was freezing cold and my legs were numb.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay now,” said Chuyi. He was standing next to me.</p>
 <p>The old man immediately pulled me out of the Golden Perianth. He took out a small, white porcelain bottle and dipped a twig into it. Then he sprinkled the water onto my legs. Eventually, my legs resumed their mobility. Then, the old man sprinkled some on the golden quilt before carefully folding it.</p>
 <p>I looked at Chuyi and asked, “Has the resentment inside the Golden Perianth been settled?”</p>
 <p>The man nodded. “Yeah, but you’d better find the quilt a new owner soon. You should go to Qinhuai River and sell it to a predestined prostitute. That’s how we can close the case without any worry…”</p>
 <p>I nodded then squatted. I picked up the Golden Perianth.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know if I was hallucinating, but the previously stinky quilt now had the scent of a woman's body. This scent could seep into people's hearts. It was exactly the same as what I had sensed in my recent dream.</p>
 <p>Did Liu Rushi come here? Perhaps only she could answer this question.</p>
 <p>Chuyi said that he needed to solve some important matters so he needed to leave.</p>
 <p>Before he left, he repeatedly asked the old man to take care of us.</p>
 <p>The old man agreed.</p>
 <p>After the man left, I asked the old man, “How can I go to Qinhuai River? I won’t take any chances with Nanjing’s highways. If people from the Longquan Villa spot me, I will be in trouble.”</p>
 <p>The old man threw a small bottle at me and scoffed. “You’re a bunch of chickens. How could Chuyi befriend people like you guys? Remember this. Before getting on the highway, each of you need to open the bottle and take a sip. Then after every twelve hours, you will need to take another sip.”</p>
 <p>“What’s this?” Li Mazi curiously swayed the small china bottle.</p>
 <p>“Earth Dragon’s urine. Do you want to drink it or not? If you don’t want it, give it back to me. I’m reluctant to give you such a precious thing.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi asked in puzzlement, “What Earth Dragon?”</p>
 <p>“The guy in your hand,” said the old man. He sounded enraged.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi couldn’t help but laugh as he held the mouse. “You mean this big mouse? You wanted us to drink a mouse’s piss? How could you come up with this idea?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the old man wanted to take the bottle back, I hurried to stop Li Mazi. I was sure that this item was priceless.</p>
 <p>The old man could buy ten cities with his assets, but he seemed reluctant to give this item away.</p>
 <p>We bid the old man farewell then departed with the Golden Perianth.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know if it was the Earth Dragon urine’s effect, but I was high-spirited along the way. I had been driving for several hours, but I didn’t feel flustered or tired. Nobody had bothered us, either.</p>
 <p>Because of the strict control in the scenic area, we could only use the bus to go to the Qinhuai River after we had arrived in Nanjing.</p>
 <p>The Golden Perianth’s matter had already spread in the circle.</p>
 <p>Every day, people came to see the Golden Perianth in waves. Most of them were antique businessmen. However, they just wanted to see the item. They didn’t have any desire to buy it since they were all men. The Golden Perianth was neither useful nor beneficial to them. Rather, it was harmful.</p>
 <p>Eventually, the Golden Perianth was sold to a young pseudo-model for the price of two million renminbi.</p>
 <p>She looked tender and full of grace. She wore revealing clothes and drove a Mercedes-Benz. Needless to say, she was a mistress some rich man had provided for…</p>
 <p>Since the Golden Perianth could make a woman more attractive, it was a powerful weapon for a mistress.</p>
 <p>After closing the deal, I wasn’t excited at all. I wondered if I was going to help or harm the pseudo-model by selling her the Golden Perianth.</p>
 <p>Sometimes women are really complicated while other times, they are really simple.</p>
 <p>They put in a lot of effort to find a man who would never leave them.</p>
 <p>However, what did this world have the most? Unfaithful men! Those silly women had betted and wasted their youth on those men.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but remember a song.</p>
 <p>How many people admired you when you were young? And how many are still willing to love you once you’re old?</p>
 <p>How many people in your life have come and gone? However, as long as I can have you, I will always be by your side.</p>
 <p>Compared to this woman, Liu Rushi, whom I accompanied to the afterworld, was much happier.</p>
