 <p>Chuyi asked me and Li Mazi to go to the hospital to take care of Chu Chu. I told Li Mazi to go alone. I wanted to stay in case Chuyi needed help.</p>
 <p>Chuyi hesitated but finally nodded.</p>
 <p>He then led me all the way to where Senior Chu was staying. The old man respectfully invited us in.</p>
 <p>Chuyi asked Senior Chu to prepare something for him: realgar wine, a butcher knife, three ‘stepping-on-corpse-leaving-no-trace,’ and some black beans.</p>
 <p>Senior Chu looked hesitant. “Realgar wine, butcher knives, and black beans are easy to find. But it’s very difficult to find some ‘stepping-on-corpse-leaving-no-trace.’ Not many people use these old things these days.”</p>
 <p>Chuyi indifferently raised three fingers. “Three medium-level spirit talismans.”</p>
 <p>Senior Chu was overjoyed. “Deal! I’m going to get you the top-quality stepping-on-corpse-leaving-no-trace.”</p>
 <p>Then, Senior Chu proceeded toward the door.</p>
 <p>Chuyi went to a tattered desk and used some blue ink to draw on his paper talismans.</p>
 <p>I was a rookie in this profession. ‘Stepping-on-corpse-leaving-no-trace’ and ‘medium-level spirit talismans’ were things I didn’t know about, so I asked him.</p>
 <p>Chuyi patiently explained to me. A ‘stepping-on-corpse-leaving-no-trace’ was actually a black donkey hoof that had stepped over a corpse.</p>
 <p>It didn’t simply have to pass over a body, but had to walk over it and leave no trace behind.</p>
 <p>These kinds of black donkey hooves could have intelligence. They were very effective in dealing with zombies.</p>
 <p>Novels that said that one could use any kind of black donkey hoof to deal with zombies were obviously lying.</p>
 <p>Medium-level spirit talismans were the better version of low-level spirit talismans.</p>
 <p>Most of the talismans, spells, and charms in the market were fake or low-level. A medium-level talisman was more than enough to deal with a malicious ghost. Although it was powerful, not many people knew how to create such a type of talisman. The materials were also scarce. In the market, it was something one couldn’t buy with money.</p>
 <p>I gawked in awe. I never thought that it was that mysterious and magical.</p>
 <p>To draw the three medium-level spirit talismans, Chuyi had spent three hours. He had drawn eight talismans altogether, but only three were working. He said that such a success rate was already high.</p>
 <p>It was already evening when Senior Chu came back. He carried a small but full bag. There was no need to ask what the contents were. They were all the items Chuyi had asked for.</p>
 <p>After he received his required items, Chuyi left. Senior Chu was very happy; tears almost fell off his face when he held the three medium-level spirit talismans.</p>
 <p>We went to the hospital to fetch Li Mazi. Then, we headed to the hotel Mu Wan was staying in.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan was still there. After seeing us, she blurted, “My brother did call. He asked me to go home as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Chuyi predicted things correctly!</p>
 <p>“How did you answer him?”</p>
 <p>“As you told me.”</p>
 <p>“Good. Tonight, we’re going to see your brother.”</p>
 <p>Then, we stayed and rested in the hotel. We slept until night time.</p>
 <p>After we got to the car, Chuyi poured some realgar wine in a small bowl and took out a white snake, placed in the bowl.</p>
 <p>I was stunned as I looked at the lifeless snake.</p>
 <p>Chuyi seemed to know my doubts and simply explained, “The small white snakes I prepared yesterday all know Mu Wan’s golden hairpin’s aura. They will be able to detect where the souls in her hairpin come from.”</p>
 <p>If he wasn’t wrong, Mu Wan’s brother’s place was the source.</p>
 <p>This kind of snake was called ‘concentric snake.’ They were very rare but Senior Chu had bred some. Chuyi had used three low-level talismans to exchange for them. No matter how far they were, the snakes could sense each other. As long as we had this snake showing us the way, we would be able to find Mu Wan’s home!</p>
 <p>Mu Wan had a questioning look. However, under the snake’s direction, after taking many complicated turns, Mu Wan’s questioning look was replaced with an astonished one.</p>
 <p>Around two hours later, the car stopped at a small village near a mountain.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan gulped. “My brother always stays on the mountain.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, what a secluded master. Staying in such a high place, I guess he’s not afraid of falling down and dying, is he?” Li Mazi sighed.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan glanced at Li Mazi. Li Mazi smiled awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Chuyi didn’t let us get off the car but released the small white snake to the mountain. We then checked and arranged the items we had prepared.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan was anxious seeing us prepare these odd items. She asked, “What are you going to do with these?”</p>
 <p>Chuyi said, “We’re going to your house shortly after. You should tell your brother that we’re your friends. You don’t need to care about anything else. I’m sure you and your brother will be safe.”</p>
 <p>Mu Wan nodded. However, she looked really fearful.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan took us to the mountain through a small trail. This trail was meandering and bumpy. Some sections did not have paths. Travelers had to use their own experience to cross through the lush bushes.</p>
 <p>“An obfuscating formation.” Chuyi suddenly sneered and said, “It seems he does have some skills.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi was confused. “What’s an obfuscating formation? Is it dangerous?”</p>
 <p>“The majority of the plants here are Greeting Pines and peaches. They were planted in a formation deduced from the ‘Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.’ Normal people wouldn’t be able to cross the place. They would give up eventually and leave the mountain. You guys have to follow me closely,” Chuyi explained.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan was a little displeased. “How could my brother be a Daoist priest? I planted them with my brother, and I don’t know about any obfuscating formation thing you mentioned.”</p>
 <p>“But your brother dug up the pits, right?” asked Chuyi.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan didn’t answer. I knew Chuyi was right.</p>
 <p>There was no path. Mu Wan walked around and passed through the various trees.</p>
 <p>After we got out, we saw a shadow squatting outside the formation.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan cheered up and walked forward. “Mu Tou!”</p>
 <p>The shadow got up. I shone my flashlight right at him. He was a strong, muscular man around thirty years old. He had a thick beard that hid his face. If we were here before the liberation day, I would have thought this man was a mountain bandit.</p>
 <p>“Mu Wan, how many times have I told you that you are not allowed to bring outsiders to the mountain? Why didn't you listen to me?” Mu Tou scoffed at her.</p>
 <p>Chuyi intervened before Mu Wan could explain who we were. “A member of the Xiao family?”</p>
 <p>After hearing Chuyi, Mu Tou’s face changed drastically. “You’re not welcomed here. Get lost! If you move one step forward, I won’t be polite anymore.”</p>
 <p>Chuyi said coldly, “One who deserves to die can’t live. One who should live can’t die.”</p>
 <p>Then, he jumped forward. “For a dead person, is it worth it?”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense,” Mu Tou’s face turned purple in rage. “Get out of here! Or else, I will make you suffer!”</p>
 <p>Mu Tou immediately drew a hatchet and slashed at a nearby big tree.</p>
 <p>Mu Wan was scared by Mu Tou’s sudden move. Mu Tou had never acted like that before.</p>
 <p>She told Mu Tou, “Brother, are you hiding something from me? They’re my friends. They’re here to help us. Why are you doing this?”</p>
 <p>“Girl, how can you be so stupid? You violated our ancestral pledge!” Mu Tou said bitterly. “But don’t you worry. I will use my life to atone for your sins. Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Then, Mu Tou grabbed Mu Wan’s hand and headed toward the mountain.</p>
 <p>“The Soul Seizing Hairpin is in my hand,” Chuyi said. “I think everybody should calm down. We need to sit down and talk. Perhaps I will be able to help you.”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Mu Tou’s emotion surged instantly. He angrily glared at Chuyi. “You stole the golden hairpin?”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t steal it,” Chuyi said. “I said I’m here to help. I’m from Mitu Temple.”</p>
 <p>“What…” Mu Tou was scared. “The Mitu Temple?”</p>
 <p>“He’s from the Zhang family,” said Chuyi as he pointed at me. “I wonder if we are now qualified to go to the mountain and talk?”</p>
 <p>Mu Tou was even more agitated and nervously watched us. After quite a long time, he nodded. “Okay!”</p>
 <p>Then, he turned around and led us up to the mountain.</p>
