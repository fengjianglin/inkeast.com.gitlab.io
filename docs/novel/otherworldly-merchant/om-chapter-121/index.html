 <p>Chapter 121: Pestering Nightmare</p>
 <p>I came back to my senses instantly. Looking at the woman under my body, I cursed under my breath for losing my self control. I started to chant the ‘sacred text of Daoism.’ Several minutes later, my raging emotions slowly quieted down.</p>
 <p>I looked at the woman with a heavy feeling of guilt. “I’m so sorry. I’ve been pestered by a perverted ghost lately. I’ve been losing my self control more often…”</p>
 <p>“Filth!” She rolled her eyes at me discontentedly. She went to her room to change into new clothes and then left with her bag.</p>
 <p>I looked at her as she was leaving, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. On top of that, I was quite annoyed; that damn grain pouch could amplify my emotions to an almost endless degree.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi entered the room, completely clueless about what happened. He looked at me and then at the woman leaving; suddenly he patted his head. “Oh, damn! Brother Zhang, did I come at a bad time? I’m so sorry... I’m leaving now, you should call her back.”</p>
 <p>I kicked him without saying a word. “What on earth are you talking about? It’s not what you’re thinking.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi guffawed. “What is there to be ashamed about? You didn’t open the door for several minutes, only God knows what was going on here. Anyway, you do have the ability to conquer her.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t have the mood to discuss with Li Mazi. “I haven’t had dinner. I’m heading out to get something to eat. And, that damned otherworldly item messed up my mind; that’s why I did something I shouldn’t have. Don’t tell anyone about this, especially Yin Xinyue. If you tell a soul, I will back out of this mess and you’ll go to jail.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi nodded repeatedly. “Don’t worry. I won’t say a word even if someone beats me up.”</p>
 <p>I took Li Mazi out to eat some pasta. When we returned, we brought two bags of refined salt, two sandalwood boxes and a peach wood stick. I planned to use them tonight.</p>
 <p>The thing in that room was pressing the woman on the bed and sexually assaulting her. Just thinking about it gave me a headache.</p>
 <p>However, it wouldn’t go as usual if no women were present, right?</p>
 <p>We would die of shame if the ghost did that to us!</p>
 <p>Still, I had some doubts. Having been an otherworldly merchant for years, I have heard of ghosts possessing someone else’s body in order to rape women. But I had never heard about any ghosts that could rape people directly…</p>
 <p>If it could, it would have to be a rare and powerful evil spirit.</p>
 <p>It seemed that we were going to have a sleepless night.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi and I checked the wiring in the entire villa to make sure that everything was in order. Then, I turned on all the electronic appliances available. Contrary to humans, ghosts hate devices that could illuminate the area or make noises.</p>
 <p>I walked around the villa, keeping an eye on things that could be problematic. However, after checking several times, I didn’t spot anything suspicious. It appeared that the item was deeply hidden.</p>
 <p>There were neighbors living around that villa, and the thought of it gave us courage.</p>
 <p>However, that courage slowly diminished as the neighbor houses’ lights were switched off. My forehead began to sweat when the street lights dimmed out!</p>
 <p>Human beings were naturally afraid of darkness. It was our instinct. I guess it’s a fear that no one can grow out of.</p>
 <p>I turned on the TV and found the recently popular movie ‘The Mermaid,’ in hopes to watch it and ease my nerves. I also hoped that the lights in the room and the sound from the TV could scare that thing.</p>
 <p><em>If the ghost doesn’t show up tonight, I would tell the woman that there was nothing wrong with the villa tomorrow. She can just sell the place if she doesn’t want to live here!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“The Mermaid” wasn’t a good comedy movie. Although I had tried to keep my eyes wide open, I still felt quite drowsy. I even thought of using two matches to support my eyelids.</p>
 <p>Eventually, I couldn’t endure it anymore. I leaned against the bed headboard and slowly drifted into sleep.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know how long I had been sleeping. However, I felt that someone was sitting on my thighs at that moment. I opened my sleepy eyes and saw a man sitting on my lap, his eyes glued to the TV.</p>
 <p>Goosebumps arose on my skin. I instinctively groped for the peach wood stick. Previously, when I was stuck in Mount Shouyang, Chuyi had told me that using the peach wood stick and refined salt to deal with evil or foul things could be doubly effective. As such, I wanted to give it a go!</p>
 <p>When I tried to find the peach wood stick under the pillow, I was frightened since I noticed that all the items were gone. I was scared and started sweating. My worried eyes raked around the place to find my items.</p>
 <p>Not looking would have been better. I was taken aback by the first glance.</p>
 <p>I found seven or eight beautiful women sitting in the corner of the room, watching TV. Those women were truly gorgeous; one was more picturesque than the other. They wore some strange golden dresses, which exposed a lot of skin. Their eyes were blank, focused on watching the TV.</p>
 <p>And, at that moment, I saw that my peach wood stick was in the hands of a beauty. She was admiring it.</p>
 <p>Seeing me staring at them, the women stared back at me. One of them beamed at me. However, when she smiled, she also revealed two long fangs.</p>
 <p>I was terrified. I could feel my legs shaking. However, I had to show a calm front. If not, those things could make further moves and I would be unable to stop them…</p>
 <p>I wanted to get up but the man sitting on my thighs was as heavy as a mountain. He pressed on me, preventing me from getting up.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t do anything other than take a deep breath and curse, “Bastard, get off me!”</p>
 <p>The man was surprised. He turned his head around to look at me.</p>
 <p>Finally, I saw the man’s face. He had dark skin, a shaved head and an oval face. His eyes were sharp but charming.</p>
 <p>I seized the chance and got off the bed. However, a beautiful woman sitting near the bed pulled my hand as soon as I did so, pulling me back to where I was.</p>
 <p>I gathered all of my courage to shout, “What the hell are you doing?!”</p>
 <p>The gorgeous woman smiled and then pointed at her own belly.</p>
 <p>I tilted my head to look and was scared out of my wits.</p>
 <p>I wasn’t sure how, but her tummy had burst open. A round head slowly protruded from the wound. It was a cute baby’s face, turning to see me, offering a sweet smile.</p>
 <p>No matter how much I’d prepared myself, I couldn’t help but scream and run for my life!</p>
 <p>However, I helplessly fell as soon as I tried to run. Everything went dark. Then, I heard Li Mazi’s voice, “Little Brother Zhang, are you okay? Hey, wake up!”</p>
 <p>I opened my eyes and found everything was back to normal. Nobody was sitting on the sofa, neither on my lap. I was lying face down on the carpet, looking quite pathetic.</p>
 <p>I hurried to check the surroundings. The lights were on and the TV was still showing Stephen Chow’s “The Mermaid.” The janitors were cleaning outside the building. A silver light shone through the window from the East. The break of dawn was really beautiful.</p>
 <p>I wiped the sweat on my forehead then slumped on the sofa.</p>
 <p>I was still frightened because of that dream. I checked the peach wood stick nearby. No one had touched it, which made me heave a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p><em>It was just a dream, then.</em></p>
 <p>However, why would I dream such a strange thing? Although the situation was a little horrifying, it was somewhat amusing as I remembered it. There were some beautiful women and a dark-skinned bald man. Li Mazi would laugh to no end if I told him about my dream.</p>
 <p>Li Mazi looked at me, while I was still absent minded. “Hey brother, are you okay? What happened?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head. “Nothing, it was just a nightmare.”</p>
 <p><em>Right, Li Mazi stayed with me the whole night</em>.</p>
 <p><em>Did he notice anything strange?</em></p>
 <p>I asked him right away.</p>
