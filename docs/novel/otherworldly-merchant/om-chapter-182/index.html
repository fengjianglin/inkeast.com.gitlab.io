 <p>Out of the blue, one of the drivers screamed. I immediately turned to ask him, “Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>He nervously pointed at the door with his chin. I turned to check, but the door seemed normal at first sight.</p>
 <p>He then pointed at the door panel.</p>
 <p>I lowered by head and saw a stream of water flowing underneath the door. However, there was a clear streak of blood flowing in the water.</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was scared; he retracted his legs and placed them on top of the bed. He nervously asked me, “Did somebody die outside?”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi grabbed a shotgun that was hung on the wall, loaded it, and then passed it to me. “Little Brother Zhang, back me up. I’m going to see what’s making a mess out there.”</p>
 <p>I hurried to stop him. He might fall into the trap of the other party if he went out unarmed!</p>
 <p>I smeared the salt and flour mixture on the shotgun Li Mazi had given me and threw it back to him. I held some flour in one hand and the Sirius Whip in the other before carefully opening the door...</p>
 <p>I was chilled by the wind that crazily blew in through the door. The wind also dispelled the wine aroma.</p>
 <p>I took a deep breath and opened the door wider, throwing the flour and salt mixture outside.</p>
 <p>The mixture fell on the floor together with the rain, and I clearly saw a headless figure in a kneeling position by the door.</p>
 <p>I was undoubtedly scared by this, so I quickly moved back, but I still used my Sirius Whip to lash out before drawing back.</p>
 <p>The figure didn’t react; it remained still after the attack.</p>
 <p>From inside the shed, Lin Longshan asked, “What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>I took a deep breath and waved my hand at him. “Nothing.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi rushed forward and pointed his flashlight at the space outside.</p>
 <p>The figure turned out to be a stone statue!</p>
 <p><em>Damn, who moved the stone statue here?</em> The sentient item would be the only one able to do this, if it wanted to harm people. It was impossible for the statue to move around on its own.</p>
 <p>I checked around, and nobody was there. I thought that person had already run away.</p>
 <p>“Who did this? Get your ass out here. Come and fight me if you have the guts!” Li Mazi angrily fired a shot into the air.</p>
 <p>However, no one answered.</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was curious, so he moved closer to see; he gawked in shock when he saw the stone statue. “Bastard! Zou San’er, I’m sure I never treated you badly. Why are you hounding me?!”</p>
 <p>I wondered if Lin Longshan was an idiot, since he kept on insisting that it was Zou San’er who had done all those things.</p>
 <p>I inspected the stone statue, trying to see where the blood came from.</p>
 <p>I didn’t take long to spot it. The rain water was washing away the blood from the neck of the statue; there was a chicken head bleeding on top of it.</p>
 <p>As it was pouring down, the chicken head slowly slid downward.</p>
 <p>My pupils enlarged as I screamed, “Don’t let that chicken head fall!”</p>
 <p>I stormed forward, trying to reach and support the head.</p>
 <p>However, it was too late. After barely taking two steps, a strange gust of wind rushed over and the chicken head fell, splashing water as it reached the ground!</p>
 <p>“Damn,” I cursed, “Someone will die tonight…”</p>
 <p>I closed the door and turned to see the people in the shed. “Guys, don’t panic. Stay calm. One of you will die tonight if you don’t do what I say.”</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was frantic as he replied, “Absolutely! We will do what you say!”</p>
 <p>I asked them, “All of you should go and sit on the bed. I want to check who was targeted by the bandits.”</p>
 <p>Li Mazi sat on his bed and asked me, “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“The resentful bandits’ souls have just started the ceremony. They want to recruit one of us to become a bandit. That’s why we saw a chicken head on the statue. If we could have stopped the head from falling, at most, one of us would have ended up in some evil gang.</p>
 <p>“But the chicken head did fall. That means he was rejected by the guardian or their ancestors. According to the bandit’s rule, rejected candidates must be beheaded!”</p>
 <p>Their eyes were wide open in shock after they heard what I said. They looked at each other, unable to utter a word.</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was terrified. “How can we spot the one who the bandits have laid their eyes on?”</p>
 <p>I said, “It’s simple. That person knows he’s been followed because he has been notified.”</p>
 <p>My eyes moved from one driver to the other. I wondered if that evil thing had told one of them about their recruitment while they were possessed.</p>
 <p>I noticed that the driver who had driven us there had a strange expression. He was looking at Lin Longshan with panic-stricken eyes. He quickly looked away when he saw me watching him.</p>
 <p>I walked to him, smiling coldly. “You must know who it is, right?”</p>
 <p>If I guessed correctly, he had to be the one who was notified.</p>
 <p>The driver shook his head. “It wasn’t me. Really, it wasn’t me.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense!” Lin Longshan ran to him and cursed, “Spill it quickly! Damn, you want to die?! Now, only these two brothers can help you!”</p>
 <p>The driver shook his head harder. “Boss, I-I… I saw an illusion earlier today. The bandit told me that he wanted to recruit you. Tonight’s ceremony was prepared for you. I didn’t think it was true, but now it seems it wasn’t just my imagination...”</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan paled immediately. “That’s impossible. You’re spouting nonsense!”</p>
 <p>“Stay calm.” I patted Lin Longshan’s shoulder. “I can ensure your safety.”</p>
 <p>Then, I turned to look at Li Mazi and he quickly understood what I meant. He approached Lin Longshan with the intention to tie him up.</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was bewildered. “What do you mean by this?”</p>
 <p>“The bandits can’t come here and take your life,” I comforted him, “They can only make you hallucinate so that you cut your own head. I will tie you down to prevent you from harming yourself.”</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan cooperated, although he was scared out of his wits. He allowed Li Mazi to tie him onto the bed.</p>
 <p>The wind was still howling outside. I walked to the door and glanced at the beheaded statue. I didn’t know why blood was still trickling down. It had been a long time and it was just a small chicken head... why wasn’t the blood washed away even after all this time?</p>
 <p>Right when I was ruminating in front of the statue, Lin Longshan shrieked behind me, “Hey, Little Liu, what are you doing?!”</p>
 <p>I was shocked when I saw that Driver Liu had already undone his ropes and was standing in front of Lin Longshan, his expression menacing.</p>
 <p>Lin Longshan was scared out of his wits. He wiggled and shrieked, crying for help.</p>
 <p>Driver Liu swiftly took out a dagger from Lin Longshan’s pocket and prepared to use it to slit his own throat.</p>
 <p>Everything happened very quickly, but Li Mazi was on alert. He immediately grabbed a chair nearby and smashed it on Driver Liu’s head.</p>
 <p>The man seemed all right even though the chair was broken to bits. He then rushed toward the window and jumped out.</p>
 <p>I chased after him, but Driver Liu had already disappeared.</p>
 <p><em>Holy crap</em>, I cursed under my breath.</p>
 <p>Needless to say, the bandits wanted to recruit Driver Liu, not Lin Longshan. Driver Liu had deceived us!</p>
 <p>I hurried to untie Lin Longshan. He dashed to the window as soon as he was freed and hurled curses at Driver Liu.</p>
 <p>The other driver begged me to save his friend.</p>
 <p>I hesitated. <em>Can I even save him? I didn’t bring anything, aside from the Sirius Whip. I’m afraid I won’t be unable to return alive if I take on the opponent directly.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>While I hesitated, the other driver cried out in surprise, “Little Liu’s right at the door. Look! He’s right at the door!”</p>
 <p>I ran to the door, and a shadow swiftly passed by, disappearing soon after. Before leaving, it threw something near the shed.</p>
 <p>I dashed out to chase after the shadow. However, Driver Liu was nowhere to be seen. At the same time, the people behind me shrieked in fright.</p>
 <p>I took a deep breath and slowly returned to the shed. On my way back, I almost tripped on something very slippery.</p>
 <p>I lowered my head to check and was immediately scared. There was half a tongue on the ground, and I had just stepped on it. Blood splashed out from the cut.</p>
 <p>The tongue looked fresh. Needless to say, it was Driver Liu’s.</p>
 <p><em>Why did the bandit make Driver Liu cut his tongue instead of his head? It wasn’t supposed to go like this...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The window behind me was gently pushed open, and I subconsciously turned around to look. Driver Liu was kneeling by the window, emulating the beheaded stone statue’s pose.</p>
 <p>He raised his head, giving us a faint smile while blood streamed from his mouth. I was barely coming to grips with the situation when something black brushed past his neck. Right after that, his head fell off and rolled like a ball. The cut was awfully neat. Blood spurted very far, dyeing Lin Longshan red.</p>
 <p>The head also rolled and stopped by Lin Longshan’s feet. Lin Longshan’s eyes rolled back, and he fainted on the spot.</p>
 <p>I was also terrified! What was that thing that could cut his neck so neatly?</p>
