 <p>Volume 3</p>
 <p><strong>139 A Complex and Intricate Matter</strong></p>
 <p>“You’re asking me to kill him, so how’s that not killing him, ever?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled elegantly, a complex look in his eyes. “How do you define killing someone? Is plunging a knife into your lover’s chest killing him? Li Shen, the reason you can’t run away from the Split Zone is not because it has entrapped you, but because it’s you who’s trapping yourself.”</p>
 <p><em>Why did Si Luo know everything?</em></p>
 <p>Si Luo tilted his head, and his silvery hair brushed over his shoulders in a dazzling arc. “Everyone knows how to talk about life’s philosophies, but not many can practice what they preach, and that’s the reason behind their unhappiness. Gaoqin is different, and I want him to be like me, to break free from these restraints and live life as he pleases.</p>
 <p>“Undoing the split symbol on Gaoqin isn’t killing him, but you’ll truly be killing him if you refuse to do so. You need to keep him company on the road he wants to take, and not on the road that he should take.”</p>
 <p>Though I still could not understand the real meaning behind Si Luo’s words, another emotion welled up in me. I began to believe that Si Luo was an extraordinary person. It’s no wonder so many people liked him.</p>
 <p>“And, the second condition?” I did not understand the first one, so I’ll just go on to the second one.</p>
 <p>“Secondly, you need to get Jiao S to leave the Split Zone. You cannot leave before her. Either you send her away first, or both of you leave together.” As Si Luo’s pale lips moved, there was a desolate kind of beauty in his eyes.</p>
 <p>I could agree to this, because he was not asking me to leave. He simply wanted me to help Jiao S find her soul splitter and send her away. As long as I did not have to make a decision to leave the Split Zone at this moment, I could agree to this.</p>
 <p>On this, I have also promised Ta Lai, that I would never leave this place.</p>
 <p>“Okay.” I nodded.</p>
 <p>“The third one?”</p>
 <p>“Thirdly…” Si Luo looked out into the distance through the window, solitude flashing in those silvery-white pupils of his.</p>
 <p>For what seemed like a long while, I stared at his beautiful profile. He then turned back and faced me with a bleak but beautiful smile. “Thirdly, I want you to kill me.”</p>
 <p>My brain felt like it just crashed.</p>
 <p><em>First, don’t kill him.</em></p>
 <p><em>Second, take her away.</em></p>
 <p><em>Third, I want you to kill me.</em></p>
 <p>As expected of Si Luo. If I did not personally hear these with my own ears, I would never have thought of it.</p>
 <p>“How can I kill you? Moreover, how do I even kill you?” I frowned deeply.</p>
 <p>He smiled casually. “This isn’t important, and I’m not telling you to do it now. I just want you to promise me that if the time comes, and if you have the ability to kill me, don’t hesitate if I ask you to.”</p>
 <p><em>This… how can it even be possible? Firstly, I can’t kill him with MF alone, and it’s even more impossible to do it through split symbol since he’s a soul splitter, and he isn’t even my soul splitter. There’s no effect on him if I stabbed him with my splitting key, so how do I even kill him?</em></p>
 <p><em>Or, did this mean he knew how to kill soul splitters?</em></p>
 <p><em>That can’t be. Aren’t soul splitters immortal? Isn’t there only one way to die – if they don’t manage to find another new body of consciousness after the previous one leaves?</em></p>
 <p><em>Right, Du Yue!</em></p>
 <p><em>Du Yue is looking for a way to kill soul splitters, so does it mean…</em></p>
 <p>“There’s no need for you to think too much into this. I won’t get you to sacrifice yourself, and you won’t be hurt if that opportunity presents itself. You’ll only benefit from killing me, and the only negative effects from killing me personally is that Gaoqin Jiuye and Jiao S would then probably doubt you.”</p>
 <p><em>I don’t think it’d just merely be doubt…</em></p>
 <p>“I don’t care anymore. Li Shen, I’ve lived for too long, and the only person who can kill me is you. So you have to agree to this. When I ask for it sometime in the future, you’ll have to kill me.”</p>
 <p>Si Luo’s pupils seemed to dilate, and they were staring at me with a dim, white fog.</p>
 <p>“No… don’t ask that of me…” I waved my hand unconsciously. I could not agree to this, how could I kill him when I think he is a good person, a soul splitter who was different from the rest.</p>
 <p>“You can’t refuse this, Li Shen. In the Split Zone, I’m the only one who can help you reach the Northern District, I’m the only one who can help you find Nie Zun, and I’m the only one who can help you defeat the one you want to beat.” Si Luo laughed maniacally, but there was steadfastness in it.</p>
 <p>I opened my eyes wide. Apart from that one line, I could not hear anything else.</p>
 <p>“You… you can help me find Nie Zun?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled. “Only I can.”</p>
 <p>It felt like we were looking at each other for a long time, and I finally could ensure that he was not bluffing, that what he said was the truth.</p>
 <p><em>If Si Luo said this, I have to reason to believe in it. If I agree, I’ll need to kill him when he asks me to. If it’s like this, was it worth it for me to agree? Can I really kill him when that day arrives?</em></p>
 <p><em>I’m afraid I might not be able to. Though I’m a monster, I’m no grim reaper who takes the lives of others without even blinking an eye.</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t reject it so quickly. Take some time to think about it, but you’ll have to give me an answer eventually.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, I’ll be going to the Southern District together with Gaoqin Jiuye and the rest. I know about the experimental grounds you guys were talking about, so I can bring you lot there, and also to look for your friends.” Si Luo was still smiling, but it just did not feel genuine.</p>
 <p>I kept my eyes on him. “You knew about that already? Why didn’t you stop it then? Though you haven’t been well, you’ve been the Southern District Commander for so long and protected those weak residents even as a soul splitter. Judging from your personality, I don’t believe that you’ll allow somebody like Du Yue to conduct her cruel experiments and hurt others in your territory.”</p>
 <p>“I wasn’t aware of it initially, but after I learnt about it, it wouldn’t make much of a difference whether I interfered or not. Furthermore, I can’t act on impulse when it comes to Du Yue.”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“You can look at it like it’s for Gaoqin, but this isn’t important. What’s important is that, are you still going to waste more time here now that I’m willing to take you to look for your friends?” Si Luo’s smile remained, but his pale eyes had a sort of icy glint to it.</p>
 <p>He looked like a noble immortal with a cold cruelty. The blood-red crescent moon on his forehead was a bright contrast to his pale, white eyes. It made him look like he was the world’s most noble and classy individual, and it made others voluntarily bow down to him.</p>
 <p>Seems like there is no use in continuing the discussion. I might have already gotten the best answer I could get.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, back to your Southern District.”</p>
 <p>As the deal was sealed, I opened the door, wanting to involve the rest in the conversation.</p>
 <p>But when I opened the door, I saw Gaoqin Jiuye, Jie Pa and Jiao S simply standing there with shocked expressions.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with all of you?” I asked, confused. Gaoqin Jiuye’s complicated gaze brushed past me and he looked towards Si Luo, who was just behind me.</p>
 <p>Si Luo seemed a little surprised by their expressions as well, and looked towards Gaoqin Jiuye for an explanation.</p>
 <p>Jiao S was the first to speak. “Huan Qing and the rest… with Ku Fei and that girl, Mi Fu, they’re gone.”</p>
 <p><em>What does it mean they’re gone??? Weren’t they just standing outside?</em></p>
 <p>Si Luo was obviously much calmer than I was. Though there was still surprise in his eyes, he went back to his usual self quickly. “Explain it in detail.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye had a complex gaze. “In the same instant when you opened the door, a bright light appeared around the three of them, and before they could react to it, they disappeared right in front of our eyes.”</p>
 <p>I was shocked. “Light? Could it be Mr Blond?”</p>
 <p>Jie Pa looked grim. “Yes, it was the same kind of light that Mr Blond uses when he takes us to the Northern District, but its speed was a hundred times faster.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye kept his eyes on Si Luo, looking even more worried. Si Luo’s eyes darkened, and said to Gaoqin Jiuye, “Could it be?”</p>
 <p>A storm seemed to rage in Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes, and he did not answer Si Luo’s question.</p>
 <p>“What’re the both of you hiding from us? You’d be familiar with the Northern District since you are both soul splitters. What happened to Mr Blond, where is he now, and why did he do that?” I asked a flurry of questions.</p>
 <p>Si Luo looked at me. “This isn’t the best time to explain all this. We should make our way to the Southern District to look for the experimental grounds. Li Shen, if you don’t move fast, there might be even more unexpected incidents that will never have an explanation.”</p>
 <p>My heart sank.</p>
 <p>Jie Pa stepped forward. “Miss Ah Shen, since it’s like this, go ahead with Miss Jiao S. Make it a quick trip, bring back Yu Liang, and let’s not think about anything else for the moment.”</p>
 <p>I glanced at Jiao S and saw her gaze on Si Luo. She seemed confused, as if she was feeling glum that she could never understand Si Luo.</p>
 <p>“Right, I’ll have to leave the Western District in your hands again.” I nodded at Jie Pa.</p>
 <p>“Jiao S, if you could send Tao Lie and Mu Li to help protect Jie Pa, please. Now that the Yuan siblings are hurt, there’s only Chou Yu and his intelligence network, I just can’t put myself at ease.”</p>
 <p>I was too worried about Jie Pa getting hurt as his body is now just like that of a normal human being, and I had no choice but to borrow manpower from Jiao S.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine,” Jie Pa hastily said.</p>
 <p>I did not bother about him, while Jiao S nodded quickly. “Not an issue. I’ll contact them before I go. Don’t worry, I still have Feng, Huo and Lei, and they’ll help me take care of Guan Nie and safeguard the Eastern District. I’ll send both Tao Lie and Mu Li to help protect your intel.”</p>
 <p>I nodded. “Thank you.”</p>
 <p>I caught a glimpse of the slight change in Gaoqin Jiuye’s face. It was probably because Jiao S mentioned Guan Nie.</p>
