 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>254 Si Luo Wakes Up</strong></p>
 <p>Nie Zun put his hands back into his pockets as he said, “You seem to have gotten that wrong. I didn’t do this to stop you at all. In fact, I don’t care whether you succeed or fail.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shouted at me all of a sudden. “Are you an idiot? You just let him do whatever he wishes to you…?”</p>
 <p>I rolled my eyes at him, but I tried to sound as casual as I could when I answered. “I’m not able to beat him anyway. Why are you shouting at me?”</p>
 <p>My brows furrowed right after I said that. Seeing my expression, Gaoqin Jiuye sounded angrier. “Do you know the pain of being heartless now?”</p>
 <p>I guess what he and Du Yue referred to as ‘the pain of being heartless’ had happened to somebody else before. This was caused by an incomplete consciousness, and it manifested itself in the form of pain.</p>
 <p>It felt like there was a huge fire burning right in the middle of my chest, and that heat was continually growing and spreading, immersing me in fiery pain.</p>
 <p>Every minute movement of mine caused me immense pain. Even though I was already rather immune to pain, this uniquely unbearable feeling of pain was pretty difficult to endure.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun and I were still enshrouded in that black fog which kept the rest at bay.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun turned to Du Yue as he asked, “Where’s Yu Liang?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue glared at him. “Why should I tell you that?”</p>
 <p>He then pointed at me. “Your plan wouldn’t go through if she doesn’t have a heart.”</p>
 <p>What he meant was that he wouldn’t return me my heart if she doesn’t do as he said.</p>
 <p>Du Yue was no fool though. “In this situation, you wouldn’t be returning her heart to her even if I did whatever you said. If that’s the case, I’ll just do whatever I want without any heed to the consequences.”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun shook his head slowly. He looked calm.</p>
 <p>In fact, he was the calmest person in the room right now. Or should I say he had always been the calmest person.</p>
 <p>I wanted to know what he was thinking at this moment, but I didn’t plan on asking him because I didn’t ask for much now.</p>
 <p>I felt contented just having him by my side, as long as I could still see him. I didn’t care what happened to the world.</p>
 <p>“Bring Yu Liang over. Or we could just continue wasting time like this.”</p>
 <p>Song Lu sided with Nie Zun this time. “Yes, bring him over first.”</p>
 <p>I thought Du Yue wasn’t someone who’d be controlled by anybody else, but to my surprise, she relented this time. She looked around at us before snapping her fingers in the air loudly.</p>
 <p>With that snap, a vortex appeared in mid-air and two individuals dropped out from it.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t the technique that Gaoqin Jiuye used to hide people. This was a spatial technique where she connected our space with the space that these individuals were in. She then used MF to bring these individuals over to our space through that connection.</p>
 <p>They were Yu Liang and Jiao S.</p>
 <p>I wanted to rush forward upon seeing Jiao S, but when I met with that black fog that surrounded us, I realized why no one dared come near it.</p>
 <p>There was a terrifying chill the moment I came into contact with that fog. It felt as if someone was blowing chilly air into every single pore on my body. It gave me the chills all over.</p>
 <p>The feeling was indescribable. It was nauseating.</p>
 <p>I could feel the depths of my soul shivering in fear. My mind felt like it was being drenched in fear.</p>
 <p>It was horrifying.</p>
 <p>I backed away quickly as Nie Zun glanced at me with slight blame in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing my attempt to approach Jiao S, Gaoqin Jiuye grabbed that bottle he placed on a desk earlier and threw it to Jiao S.</p>
 <p>Though Jiao S did not have her eyes, she could still use her MF. Her other senses were still working fine and she managed to grab the bottle.</p>
 <p>She opened it without hesitation before taking out an eyeball and putting it back into her eye socket. Liquid from the bottle, which might be formalin, dripped down her hands as she did so.</p>
 <p><em>What a scene…</em></p>
 <p>She moved and rolled her eyes after putting the both of them back into her sockets. She looked exactly like this when she moved those emotionless eyes of hers in the past.</p>
 <p>I felt joy at seeing this familiar face, but I actually found her a little more adorable without them…</p>
 <p>With her eyes back, that aura and attitude of hers were back too.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t expect you to let her out too,” Gaoqin Jiuye said to Du Yue coldly.</p>
 <p>Du Yue pointed at Yu Liang. “Isn’t this a better present for you?”</p>
 <p>Yu Liang had been quiet since his arrival, and there had been no change in his expression at all. He did not look in Song Lu’s direction, and he looked like he was ignoring everything that was going on. It was as if he did not even recognize Song Lu.</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed past Song Lu’s face when she set eyes on him. I was able to catch it though she suppressed it quickly.</p>
 <p>What was up with these people? Why pretend that it didn’t matter if you didn’t care about me, because I didn’t care about you too? It was almost as if it was some kind of game.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye wouldn’t pass up such an opportunity. He spoke with haste, “Yu Liang, take the splitting key from Si Luo.”</p>
 <p>An air vortex appeared as Gaoqin Jiuye waved his hands in the air.</p>
 <p>A beautiful, white-robed Si Luo dropped into his arms. He looked like an angel descended from heaven as he lay in Gaoqin Jiuye’s arms, as if he did not have anything against the world.</p>
 <p>Yu Liang finally looked up at Si Luo. He then went over and took out the spitting key from Si Luo without a word.</p>
 <p>Si Luo woke up just like this.</p>
 <p>When he woke up, the blood-red crescent moon in between his brows seemed to glow a little, making me wonder if my eyes were fooling me.</p>
 <p>When he opened his silvery-white eyes, I could see the unadulterated joy in Gaoqin Jiuye. He placed Si Luo gently on the ground as if he was some fragile treasure.</p>
 <p>An enchanting smile appeared on Si Luo, making my heart flutter. <em>Oh, I didn’t have a heart now. Nothing could flutter.</em></p>
 <p>His clear voice rang throughout the room. “I guess I wasn’t being careful enough and ended up falling asleep for a long time.”</p>
 <p>He looked sprightly. He didn’t look like he was going to die anytime soon. I heaved an inward sigh of relief at this. Huan Qing and Mi Fu were no longer in the Split Zone, and since he didn’t look sickly, Gaoqin Jiuye wouldn’t be bothering me about this anymore.</p>
 <p>Jiao S’s eyes were no longer emotionless as she saw Si Luo wake up. They were bright and shiny, as if she was looking at a pile of diamonds.</p>
 <p><em>Gosh, this woman wasn’t even this emotional when she saw me after such a long time. I guess she doesn’t care about me anymore now that Si Luo is here.</em></p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked suddenly. “This is interesting.”</p>
 <p><em>Yes, it is indeed.</em></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye and Si Luo were beside each other with Jiao S facing them. I was standing closer to Jiao S, somewhere to the side, enshrouded in a circle of black fog with Nie Zun.</p>
 <p>On the other end stood Yu Liang and Du Yue, with Song Lu not far away from them. Jie Pa had been standing close behind Nie Zun from the start.</p>
 <p>Jie Pa would always keep a low profile somewhere behind as long as Nie Zun was around. <em>Just like how Nie Zun stayed behind me in the past.</em></p>
 <p><em>Right, did Jie Pa actually say anything?</em></p>
 <p>I guess he was observing everything.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun laughed. “Yes, this is interesting. What should we do next?”</p>
 <p>This did not sound like him.</p>
 <p>He shouldn’t be asking something like this.</p>
 <p>I had a feeling that someone was going to start something at this very moment.</p>
 <p>As expected, Du Yue moved suddenly.</p>
 <p>She shot a green light at Nie Zun from her palm. She was targeting Nie Zun right from the beginning, but Nie Zun did not move at all.</p>
 <p>The black fog in front of him thickened right before that green light reached it.</p>
 <p>A screen made out of black fog blocked Du Yue’s attack.</p>
 <p>“Attacking now? What’s your goal?” Si Luo laughed.</p>
 <p>I then decided to break this stalemate by waving towards Si Luo. “Been quite a while.”</p>
 <p>That unbearable pain assaulted my chest as I waved.</p>
 <p>Si Luo was looking at a woman with a weird expression on her face, where her brows were knitted tightly together and who looked like she was forcing a smile out of herself while waving a hand at him.</p>
 <p>He responded gently with a wave of his hand, his robes looking like fluffy clouds around his pale arm. He said, “Hi, been quite a while.”</p>
 <p>It immediately felt awkward.</p>
 <p>This attempt of mine did not seem to have made the situation any better. It just made it seem as if I was a lunatic who crashed the party without knowing what was actually going on.</p>
 <p><em>Whatever, I’ve been a lunatic for more than a mere day or two anyway.</em></p>
 <p>I wondered what it was that made this group of people meet in this particular situation. It would be difficult to replicate a similar situation to this.</p>
 <p>“It’s been a long time.”</p>
 <p>Jiao S was the one who said this in that hoarse voice of hers. <em>Alright, there was actually somebody else apart from me who would use such a line to continue this conversation.</em></p>
 <p>I knew Jiao S’s goal was different from mine. She was testing the waters to see if Si Luo noticed her, or she might just be trying to get some sort of reaction from Si Luo.</p>
 <p>Si Luo’s silvery hair seemed to dance in this windless room as that blood-red crescent moon on his forehead glowed faintly. “Yes, it is. Been quite a while.”</p>
