 <p>Volume 2</p>
 <p><strong>99&nbsp;Sudden Appearance of The Seven Demons</strong></p>
 <p>As I was staring at both Gao Qi and Pomelo, Gaoqin Jiuye suddenly dragged me forcefully away from them.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” I wanted to fling his hand away, but his expression was serious and grim.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with you?” I frowned, glancing at him.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye tilted his head slightly, as if observing something. “Shh, don’t talk. There seems to be someone like us nearby.”</p>
 <p>There was a nagging feeling that these people were not on our side, and I snapped alert, looking around to see if there was any danger.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye had dragged me about 20 meters away from Gao Qi, and though my MF was activated, it did not seem to work on Pomelo and him. I could not hear their conversation at that distance.</p>
 <p>I could only look at those unfathomable eyes of his, which currently looked dull and lifeless.</p>
 <p>I wanted to move closer again, but I felt a killing intent!</p>
 <p>I met Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes, and his gaze confirmed my suspicions! Just who is near?</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Seven masked individuals in navy blue wraps appeared, holding seven blades!</p>
 <p>“Are they acting in a drama? They look like assassins from Japan,” I smirked, recognising them as You Ji’s Seven Demons!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye seemed to also recognise them. “Seven Demons?”</p>
 <p>The leader of the seven spoke in a deep and hoarse voice, “Didn’t expect we would be that famous. We’ve finally found you, Li Shen. If you don’t tell us how to return to the Split Zone today, don’t blame us for not being civil!”</p>
 <p>I was dismayed. <em>Tell them how to return to the Split Zone? Who would tell me the method then??</em></p>
 <p>“How did you arrive in this world?” Gaoqin Jiuye asked swiftly.</p>
 <p>The third person among the seven - Number 3 for the moment, I shall identify them in this order for now.</p>
 <p>Number 3 scoffed, “I don’t know what ability Old Man Fan used, but he moved the entire Western District into a crack in space that exists within this world, trapping all of us here, even separating us! The real world is huge, do you have any idea how long we took to find one another?”</p>
 <p><em>What and what? This is Old Man Fan’s doing?</em></p>
 <p>“Give a clearer explanation,” I said icily.</p>
 <p>Number 7 spoke, “Li Shen, why are you pretending? This is a crack in space between the Split Zone and the real world. Old Man Fan moved everyone from the Western District here, to different places all around the world. But we are not able to return to the real world nor the Split Zone. It’s all thanks to him that we are living here like spirits!”</p>
 <p><em>This means that everyone from the Western District is now within this crack in space? Old Man Fan’s technique resulted in this? Why did he do it?</em></p>
 <p>“How about the Western District Residence?” I asked.</p>
 <p>“How would we know. We arrived here individually, and we are looking for a way to go back to the Split Zone.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye suddenly gave me an evil smile. “You Western District people do have some skills. Such a technique is almost like passing judgement, making everyone end up in different places in the real world, but still they remain in a different dimension, being able to only live like a spirit. This is a type of technique where space can be controlled, but not everyone can easily find the crack in space between the Split Zone and the real world. Does this mean that he has unlocked the secret of the Split Zone?”</p>
 <p>My thoughts were in a flurry.</p>
 <p>No matter how clear my head was, I was still unable to understand the current situation. I saw Gao Qi walking further away, almost entering a building in the university, and Pomelo was walking towards the entrance.</p>
 <p>It was agonizing looking at Gao Qi’s figure, but this was not the time to chase after him.</p>
 <p>Tilting my head, I saw Gaoqin Jiuye staring at me coldly, as if he was about to burst with outrage.</p>
 <p>“You’re the Southern District’s Gaoqin Jiuye?” The leader of the Seven Demons asked out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye then moved his gaze away from me to look at them. “Only recognize me now? And you call yourselves the Seven Demons? More like the Seven Demented.”</p>
 <p>I deadpanned. <em>You think you are the emperor, and everyone had to recognize you? I did not even hear about you before this.</em></p>
 <p>Now was not the right time to bruise his pride though. After all, I might not be a match for the Seven Demons alone.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, Li Shen, colluding with the Southern District’s dog when you don’t know how to be a district commander?” Number 7 asked.</p>
 <p>I sucked in a breath, not wanting to look at Gaoqin Jiuye’s expression. Shaking my head inwardly, I prayed for these children who speak without learning enough about the world. <em>I hope you don’t die too terribly. I should be taking it up with you when you think I am not a good district commander, but since you have offended a scarier BOSS, I shall let it slide.</em></p>
 <p>As I expected, after that juvenile spoke, reeling air currents immediately appeared around all seven of them!</p>
 <p>Like a sudden hurricane, the seven vortexes surrounded them tightly!</p>
 <p>There was a whooshing sound, and countless pillars of air rose up around me!</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but snatch a look at Gaoqin Jiuye. He did not look angry anymore, but he had an ominous expression as he moved his lips. “Fix!”</p>
 <p><em>Fix? Persuader?</em></p>
 <p>This is the second time I have seen him use his ability of persuasion, and I quickly looked at the seven individuals, trying to determine how powerful of an ability it was!</p>
 <p>What surprised me was, these individuals holding onto their blades all looked dumbstruck, and they were rooted to the ground!</p>
 <p>Since they were motionless, those pillars of air around me and Gaoqin Jiuye started flying towards them, and pierced them all, turning them into bloody dice!</p>
 <p>Looking at the bloody bodies leaking from their wounds, I almost shouted, “People really listen to you, Persuader. Just like this, they stay put?”</p>
 <p>I dashed up to the seven individuals in disbelief and gave Number 7 a slap. Number 7 looked at me, incensed, but stayed motionless!</p>
 <p><em>That great?!</em></p>
 <p><em>Then why did he still engage us in fights previously? When he could just make us stay put?</em></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye playfully said, “My powers of persuasion only work on those with a lower MF than me, and the bigger the difference in our MF, the longer it lasts.”</p>
 <p><em>What? Lasts longer? There is a time limit to this? Phew, I was relieved. This should be the case, or else it would become a god-like power.</em></p>
 <p><em>But the Seven Demons are You Ji’s trusted aides, so their MF should not be too low. Even if it was not as high as Gaoqin Jiuye’s, there should not be much of a difference right?</em></p>
 <p>“How long will they stay motionless?” I pointed at Number 7.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shrugged. “I don’t know. With your MF, it would probably be effective on you for a second or two. Their MF should be lower than yours, so about a minute?”</p>
 <p><em>Why didn’t you tell me this sooner?!</em></p>
 <p>I retreated in haste, but I was not quick enough. Number 7, who had already regained mobility, was looking at me with a raised blade!</p>
 <p>I drew an arrow from behind, and stuck it right in his face. I then activated my MF and teleported back to Gaoqin Jiuye’s side!</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Make them stay put again!” I shouted angrily at Gaoqin Jiuye while pointing at the row of people coming towards us with their blades.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye casually shrugged. “I can’t use it today anymore. I can only use this ability of persuasion once a day.”</p>
 <p><em>Bloody hell!</em></p>
 <p>No time to argue with this airhead, I used Piercer to produce a violet blade!</p>
 <p>The seven individuals hurriedly retreated as I sent out my violet blade, and rapidly, they formed a human wall with three in the bottom layer, and two each in the middle and top layers, like a gymnastic formation!</p>
 <p>At the same time, they put their blades right in front of their faces, and made a weird posture!</p>
 <p>Like a perfect formation, countless blades of light flew towards us as they chanted!</p>
 <p>My violet blade was dissolved by some of the blades of light after colliding into them!</p>
 <p>There were still some blades flying towards us!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye focused his gaze, and a white fog appeared with a boom!</p>
 <p>A pillar of air rose up from the ground, crushing all the blades of light!</p>
 <p>“Can you kill this Southern District’s dog?” Gaoqin Jiuye asked leisurely.</p>
 <p>I looked at the seven individuals to my side who looked like they were going into a new formation, shouting, “Don’t you want to go back to the Split Zone? We arrived here knowing nothing either. There’s nothing to gain by fighting, how about we look for a solution together?”</p>
 <p>I suggested this as I know that these seven are good with their formations, and although Gaoqin Jiuye has skills, if we were to fight, it would be a long one, and we would not even be able to kill them.</p>
 <p>Apart from that, I wanted to find out if they had a way to kill Gaoqin Jiuye and I. To put it simply, to find out whether the experiment was successful and whether they have found a drug that could effectively kill the consciousness.</p>
 <p>As expected, the leader scorned, “You think the seven of us are afraid to die? We can sacrifice ourselves whenever needed!”</p>
 <p>Alright, this meant they did not have a way to kill Gaoqin Jiuye and I, and they can only kill us through the split symbols. In this case, I am not afraid.</p>
 <p>“That’s what I’m saying, what for? If any of you dies, your formation will be broken. Even if you want to make an enemy out of me, we can always return to the Split Zone to continue the fight!”</p>
 <p>The leader of the seven smiled menacingly. “Who said that our formation will be broken if one of us is gone?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, all of them landed back on the ground and slid their blades into the ground, producing seven arrays of light!</p>
