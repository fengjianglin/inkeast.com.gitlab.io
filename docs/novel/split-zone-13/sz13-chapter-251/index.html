 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>251 His Illusion</strong></p>
 <p>Du Yue’s chances of winning would definitely be lowered in a scenario where she had to go against five others.</p>
 <p>To win, one had to know your enemy. Though she was powerful, there were two other individuals here who knew her rather well. In such a situation, it would be difficult for her to emerge victor if she wages a war on her own.</p>
 <p>I didn’t believe that she’d actually choose to fight us alone, and she did not make that choice either.</p>
 <p>She looked at me steadily. “Do you really think that those pills I made would be ineffective?”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
 <p>She snapped her fingers loudly.</p>
 <p>The scene in front of me started shaking.</p>
 <p>I heard Gaoqin Jiuye ask, “What did you do to her…?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not my fault when she voluntarily ate it. The drug only has a limited effectiveness if I don’t activate it. You’re worried? Don’t you want her to remember everything about you?”</p>
 <p>“No, you can’t do that.”</p>
 <p><em>So this was to activate the drug again?</em></p>
 <p><em>I can finally find out what happened in the past?</em></p>
 <p>Instead of being afraid, I was surprisingly calm. <em>Li Shen, Li Shen, just what have you forgotten?</em></p>
 <p>Just as I felt my consciousness slipping away, a cold hand grabbed me. That hand was as cold as ice, but I felt an indescribable sense of security in that coldness.</p>
 <p>His voice was calm beside my ear. “Seems like I have to use that technique on you.”</p>
 <p>Right after that, darkness blanketed my vision and I began to feel as if I was falling.</p>
 <p>It didn’t feel as if I was falling at a high speed, and it didn’t feel as if I was dropping into a bottomless pit.</p>
 <p>It felt like I was slowly flying downwards. It was sort of relaxing.</p>
 <p>“Time to wake up, Shen’er.” I heard Nie Zun’s familiar voice.</p>
 <p>Snapping my eyes open, I lost that feeling of flying immediately. I stood up and looked around me.</p>
 <p>I seemed to be on a tiny tropical island, but it did not seem like an uninhabited island. There was an abundance of trees, flowers, and little animals.</p>
 <p>The island was surrounded by a sea, and I woke up by the shore. Climbing up to higher ground, I could see the waves crashing against the rocks. I enjoyed the smell of the fresh air as the breeze from the sea tousled my hair.</p>
 <p>I have not felt this alive in such a long time.</p>
 <p>I didn’t want to think about what was happening right now nor where exactly this was as I shouted towards the ocean, “Ahhh…….!”</p>
 <p>After taking a deep breath, I felt re-energized as the cold air entered my throat.</p>
 <p>This felt different from the Split Zone.</p>
 <p>I literally felt alive at this very moment.</p>
 <p>Someone tapped me on the shoulder as I was busy being excited on my own.</p>
 <p>My heart flinched a little in fear before I turned around to look.</p>
 <p>His starry eyes met mine.</p>
 <p>The wind tousled his wispy bangs, and the sunlight reflected off his black hair, making it look golden brown.</p>
 <p>It was the first time I saw such a gentle gaze on him.</p>
 <p>“Nie… Zun…” I stuttered.</p>
 <p>He interrupted me gently, “Call me Zun.”</p>
 <p>My eyes widened in slight shock. <em>Call him… Zun?</em></p>
 <p>I’ve never called him that, and it was difficult for me to change how I addressed him all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>But what he did next made me even more surprised.</p>
 <p>He reached out and took me in an embrace.</p>
 <p>Resting my chin on his shoulders, I looked up at the endless azure sky. The sky was blue instead of gray here, and there were clouds around. The sun was behind me, and I could hear the sound of the waves hitting the shore. Though the breeze was chilly, it felt comfortable as it blew across my back.</p>
 <p>Though his embrace still felt chilly, there was no one else but him who could give me such a sense of security.</p>
 <p>After being in a daze for about ten or more seconds, I finally returned his hug as I wrapped both my arms around his waist.</p>
 <p>We hugged each other tightly.</p>
 <p>My eyes were open as I asked softly, “I’m not dreaming, am I…?”</p>
 <p>His voice was dreamy but clear at the same time. “You’re not. I’m Nie Zun, and you’re hugging me now.”</p>
 <p><em>Where is this place? Where are we? Why are we here? Why are you treating me so differently now?</em> There were many more questions in my head, but I didn’t want to ask any of them.</p>
 <p>None of that mattered in this moment.</p>
 <p>At least I knew that I wasn’t dreaming.</p>
 <p>This might be an illusion, or some other space that I was not aware of. But these things were not important anymore.</p>
 <p>What mattered was that I could feel that the real Nie Zun was right in front of me now. He was no impostor.</p>
 <p>That was enough.</p>
 <p>I’ll cherish this precious moment.</p>
 <p>Just like that day in the demon cave, I wanted time to stop so that I could just stay by his side like this.</p>
 <p>Just like what he did for me in the past.</p>
 <p>Nothing mattered more than this.</p>
 <p>Although this might just be me running away from things, I’d rather enjoy this beautiful moment, even if it might turn out to be a lie.</p>
 <p>I hugged him even tighter as I thought of this.</p>
 <p>He returned it.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to ask me anything?”</p>
 <p>My chin was still resting against his shoulder as I spoke, “Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Then…”</p>
 <p>I interrupted him. “I want to, but I won’t. Shhh. Just let me hold you like this for a while.”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun kept quiet after that.</p>
 <p>I closed my eyes slowly and took another breath of the refreshing air. I could smell Nie Zun’s unique aroma with it.</p>
 <p>This was a smell that was indescribable.</p>
 <p>It was like telepathy between us. I could always feel it and smell it whenever he was around.</p>
 <p>This was that aura which gave me a sense of security.</p>
 <p>There was nothing to be worried about and nothing to be afraid of, because he would be by my side like this.</p>
 <p>I could free my mind of all thoughts as I held him.</p>
 <p>I’ve never felt this way before, and I might never feel this way again.</p>
 <p><em>Let time stop now.</em></p>
 <p>Every girl would probably have had such a thought. Every girl would have had such an experience, and it might have been more than once, or with more than one individual.</p>
 <p>But I only had Nie Zun in my life.</p>
 <p>It was only now that I began to realize how scary it was to get used to being together every single day.</p>
 <p>He had been by my side for way too long.</p>
 <p>It was like a slow-acting drug where he enters your life slowly but surely, and takes over all your senses and everything in your mind.</p>
 <p>You’d be crying tears of joy when you realize it, and you’d be smiling bitterly too, because you’d know that you’ll never be able to leave him, ever.</p>
 <p>He had become your greatest weakness, and your only weakness.</p>
 <p>I could not imagine losing him, not even for a mere second.</p>
 <p>I took him in a tighter embrace as I felt my heart overflow with emotions.</p>
 <p>“Zun…” I called out, hearing my own voice being carried away by the wind.</p>
 <p>“Mm,” he answered, as if reassuring me that he was right there.</p>
 <p>My tears started falling just like this.</p>
 <p>He then let go of me slowly, as if he had sensed something.</p>
 <p>I didn’t want that embrace to end, so I grabbed him tightly, refusing to let go.</p>
 <p>He seemed to get a little anxious at this, probably because he could tell I was crying.</p>
 <p>But he still let me grab him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared, I’m here,” he said.</p>
 <p>Looking up at the clear sky, I knew that no matter how much I wanted for this moment to last, I had to face reality.</p>
 <p>Avoidance does not solve any problems.</p>
 <p>Finally, I let go of him unwillingly.</p>
 <p>I smiled as I looked into his eyes. “Tell me, where is this place? Why am I here?”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun’s gaze entrapped me as he brushed my hair lovingly. “You’re in an illusion that I’ve created.”</p>
 <p>I stuttered, “You… you know how to create illusions?”</p>
 <p>He nodded. “Guan Nie taught me a bit, and I’ve seen Huan Qing use it a few times. The way they controlled MF seemed similar to how I controlled mine, so I tried to do this on my own.”</p>
 <p>“But why did you pull me into your illusion…?”</p>
 <p>He smiled gently. “It’s not only you. I’m here in the illusion too. It’s nothing, just treat it as a present from me. Taste the freedom here with me for a little while.”</p>
