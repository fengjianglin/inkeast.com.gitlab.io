 <p><strong>100&nbsp;Human Skin Violet Whip</strong></p>
 <p><em>Individual formations? Are these people are just itching for a fight?</em></p>
 <p>“It’s obvious these are excuses. They just want a fight.” Gaoqin Jiuye raised his hands, smirking.</p>
 <p><em>Huh, fight? Shall we fight then?</em></p>
 <p>I took Piercer in my right hand, flicked my hair, and moved two steps backwards.</p>
 <p>Starting with a good posture is a must before a fight! This is to look imposing!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye did not underestimate the abilities of these seven individuals, and with his right hand, he was already reaching for the long and black flexible sword he carried with him at the waist!</p>
 <p>If I remember right, Ta Lai mentioned that this long black sword was one of the four living weapons - Shen Qi!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye held onto Shen Qi's conical hilt, and slowly drew it out, revealing the cold, gleaming black sword. The weapon attracted my gaze, and all of my focus was on that sword.</p>
 <p>When worn on his waist, the sword looked like high quality black silk, but as he pulled it out, it sprang into the world’s thinnest and sharpest blade.</p>
 <p>Ping!</p>
 <p>He swished the sword upwards, and a jet black ray flashed past me!</p>
 <p>This is the most beautiful moment I have witnessed in the real world! Rays of sunlight scattered onto the jet black sword, and its cruel killing intent was made stronger by this contrast of warm sunlight blending with the chilly sword!</p>
 <p>The seven individuals opposite were also staring at Shen Qi like fools!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye wielded Shen Qi gracefully, which was two meters long!</p>
 <p>The long and thin blade was extremely steady and it did not even waver when high in the air!</p>
 <p>“Wrath of the gods, the prayers of ten thousand, the sorrows of the living and the dead, Shen Qi is indeed one of the four living weapons!”</p>
 <p>The seven opposite started to sing praises of the weapon!</p>
 <p>I was a little resentful, Piercer is also one of the four living weapons, a beautiful weapon with a length of more than two meters, why did it feel like it was not as great as this Shen Qi?</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye smirked. “Is this the time to praise your enemy?”</p>
 <p>Immediately after, he lightly flicked his right wrist.</p>
 <p>“Ping!” The swish of the sword produced a bright and clear sound, generating dark rays!</p>
 <p>A pencil-thin ray of black and red light flew into the air, just like the northern lights!</p>
 <p>The seven opposite us were mesmerized! Although they looked dumb and idiotic, I had the same expression at this moment! Those slender rays were just too beautiful! A slim arc of jet black with a little bit of blood red formed in the air, just like an arc of water, it was blooming in the air!</p>
 <p>Slash!</p>
 <p>A more beautiful sight was that of those seven heads flying into the air.</p>
 <p>Fresh blood splattered everywhere in the sunlight, prettier than watercolor!</p>
 <p>It is indeed true that the more beautiful it is, the deadlier it will be...</p>
 <p>I shook my head at those seven heads in the air, surprised expressions still on their faces. I know their abilities, and if they had seen Shen Qi before, they would not have been so enthralled and this careless. Not only was the light produced by Shen Qi ravishing, its speed was comparable to that of lightning!</p>
 <p>Before I could blow raspberries to boo at these people, Gaoqin Jiuye used his other hand to bring out several charms!</p>
 <p>As he chanted, the seven charms stuck themselves onto those seven heads, and they instantly dropped to the ground!</p>
 <p>This scene was too beautiful for me to continue watching… So I chose to look at Shen Qi instead.</p>
 <p>Shen Qi was back at Gaoqin Jiuye’s waist, looking like a black belt!</p>
 <p>“This Shen Qi of yours...” I pointed at his waist, wanting to speak, but at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me playfully, and excitement flashed in his hazel eyes. “I know he is pretty. Actually, Piercer can be like this too. Piercer is cursed, so she’d be much more ravishing.”</p>
 <p>I held my head high proudly. “Of course my Piercer would be beautiful.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye mocked, “I’m saying when she comes alive. Your Piercer right now is in a dormant state, how could it be beautiful.”</p>
 <p>“Dormant?” I was stunned.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye nodded. “What? Since you already know we have living weapons, don’t you know these weapons can be in two states - dormant or resurrected?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head, Ta Lai did not mention this before.</p>
 <p>“Living weapons are named so because they have been created with a part of a living person, and because Piercer was created with an entirely intact piece of human skin, it has a malicious aura.”</p>
 <p>Human skin… My face twitched as I looked at the soft whip glowing with a faint violet light.</p>
 <p>“I cannot say too much about Piercer, but it might not be a bad thing that she is dormant now. I suggest not trying to tame Piercer, it is different from Shen Qi. Though the soul in Shen Qi is not a kind one either, at least he obeys me. I’ve never seen the soul in Piercer submit to anyone, she’s merely a bloodthirsty and rebellious soul. My advice is to return it to where you got it from as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>I listened to Gaoqin Jiuye’s words carefully, but my eyes were on those seven severed heads on the ground. They were motionless and their eyes were staring into the air, with those charms still stuck on their faces. Their bodies remained stiffly in their original position.</p>
 <p>“What happened to them?” I pointed at the seven, asking Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye put his hands back into his pockets. “I’m temporarily restricting their movement with these charms, since they won’t seem to listen to either of us. Being in such a beautiful place, I’m not in the mood for a fight either. So, I’m letting them be good for a while.”</p>
 <p>I thought of something and frowned. “If I remember right, the charms just need to be attached to a part of the body, why did you decapitate them?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye tilted his head, his dark brown hair was rather long and covered half of his eye. There was a glint in his dark hazel eyes, and his lips formed an arc in a slight smile. “Because, I like it.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>I was speechless.</p>
 <p>I thought it was because the opponent was too strong that he had to use Shen Qi. In the end, it was because he wanted to show it off to distract the enemy, and take advantage of the opportunity to use the charms!</p>
 <p><em>Are all men in the Split Zone horrid like this...</em></p>
 <p>“What should we do next?” I asked while looking at those severed heads and the seven standing corpses.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shrugged. “Bring me around to continue exploring. Let’s leave them here.”</p>
 <p>Cold sweat formed on my forehead. “You’re not planning to go back to the Split Zone?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t they say that this was Old Man Fan’s doing? Since Old Man Fan did it for you, he would have provided you a way to return. Don’t be so anxious, the method will find you eventually. Moreover, as long as they were in the Western District, they would have arrived in this crack in space. This means that the others will be able to find us, and our teammates will be here sooner or later. Everything will be alright, so let’s continue exploring the area.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked excited and curious, and continued to look around the area, as if he had never seen anything in the real world before.</p>
 <p><em>What positive thinking...</em></p>
 <p><em>It’s just an excuse to continue having fun here...</em></p>
 <p><em>Alright, since the situation is as it is, why not do as he says. Considering Jiao S and Jie Pa’s intelligence, they’d be able to find me very quickly. As for Nie Zun, just where did he go, why would he be separated from me...</em></p>
 <p>“Let’s go, stop blanking out. Those few would be immobilized for at least 60 hours, but I don’t know how time works in this crack in space. Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>I looked at the figure of Gaoqin Jiuye from the back, and hurriedly caught up.</p>
 <p>“You’re not going to look for your first love?” Gaoqin Jiuye suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>My heart hurt as soon as I reminded myself of Gao Qi’s pallid face. “No, knowing he is still alive is already enough for me. He can’t see me anyway.”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, now that you know he’s alive, are you more intent in finding your soul splitter so that you can return here to be in love with him?” Gaoqin Jiuye’s voice sounded slightly off.</p>
 <p>I took a deep breath. “No. No matter what, it is a fact that I almost killed him. To this world, I’m merely a sinner who shouldn’t exist. Why come back here.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye turned back quickly, holding me by the shoulders, he had a cold gleam in his eyes. “You just love to take responsibility for everything? That’s a bad habit.”</p>
 <p>I looked up at him. “Who would be used to this? But the fact is, it is my fault. Some things just cannot be resolved.”</p>
 <p>“So running away can solve the issue?” Gaoqin Jiuye continued.</p>
 <p>I was silent for a moment, then I spoke, “Gaoqin Jiuye, have you never thought of running away?”</p>
 <p>His gaze seemed to waver, but it was only for a moment. “I had to pay a high price for running away, so I don’t wish for you to go on the same path.”</p>
 <p>I scoffed, “So this is for my own good? Didn’t know you had it in you to be kind to me...”</p>
 <p>It might be because I’ve always been ruthless when chiding him, or it was my tired expression that made him more affectionate in that moment. Unexpectedly, he lifted his hand to stroke my hair.</p>
 <p>I could almost hear the sound of my hair moving as his fingers swept through my red hair.</p>
 <p>“Indeed I am curious. Just why do I feel like I want to be kind to you?”</p>
 <p>This voice close to my ear was eerily similar to that of Gao Qi’s enchanting voice.</p>
