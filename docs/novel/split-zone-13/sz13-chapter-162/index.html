 <p>Volume 3</p>
 <p><strong>162 You’ll Find Out If You Try</strong></p>
 <p>I saw a familiar face as I reached the center of the sea of monsters!</p>
 <p>Among the monsters, there was this enormous python in the middle. It looked like an ordinary python, but it was humongous. A pair of bright green eyes was staring at both Gaoqin Jiuye and I.</p>
 <p>Wrapped up in that enormous python was a tiny figure. She was sitting on the python and she giggled as she blinked at me. She even waved at me.</p>
 <p>Soft, golden hair fell across her forehead, and she looked like an adorable doll even with a mischievous expression on her chubby face. Her looks did not match with that gigantic python at all!</p>
 <p>I said, “Lau… Laurel!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, Ah Shen <em>jiejie</em>, come quick, come over here.” Laurel kept waving at me, like a little child who was waiting for me to play with her.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye held me back. I turned and shook my head at him, reassuring him that I will not do anything impulsive.</p>
 <p>But Gaoqin Jiuye did not let go.</p>
 <p>I turned back, but I wasn’t able to see Nie Zun clearly.</p>
 <p>“<em>Jiejie</em>, come over quickly, don’t you want to go to the Northern District? Now that the Southern District is about to be destroyed by me, the only way to the Northern District is through my baby’s tummy.”</p>
 <p>Laurel giggled mischievously, pointing at that giant python below her.</p>
 <p>I kept my eyes on her. There were tons of questions in my mind, and seeing her unlocked a flood of emotions in me.</p>
 <p>Everything started because of Laurel. I still remembered how innocent and naïve she was when she first arrived in the Western District. She’s like this now because I wasn’t able to protect her.</p>
 <p><em>It’s all because of me.</em></p>
 <p>“Ah Shen <em>jiejie</em>.” Laurel smiled at me warmly.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that you’ll always protect me?” She continued in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>I bit my lips.</p>
 <p>“Laurel, it’s my fault for not being able to protect you. No matter what, no matter what you’ve been through, go back with <em>jiejie</em>. This time, I’ll definitely protect you well,” I said resolutely as I looked at her.</p>
 <p>She lifted a tiny hand to hide her lips. “<em>Jiejie</em>, haven’t I told you this before? I’ve found what I want. I hope <em>jiejie</em> can come with me too. Aren’t you always on my side, Ah Shen <em>jiejie</em>?”</p>
 <p>“What do you want.” I started to calm down as I kept my eyes on her.</p>
 <p>Laurel laughed. “What I want, you really cannot give, <em>jiejie</em>.”</p>
 <p>“How’d you know if you don’t say it.” I smiled.</p>
 <p>Laurel’s eyes flashed with a cunning flicker as she said, “I want to…</p>
 <p>“Bathe the Split Zone in blood…</p>
 <p>“I hate this pretentious look of you <em>jiejie</em>, kekekekeke…” Laurel laughed as she saw me frown in response to what she just said. There was a quick flicker in her eyes as those tiny hands continued to hide her laughter!</p>
 <p>Then, that enormous python opened its wide, bloody jaws!</p>
 <p>No, wide is not the right word. I could see nothing but blood red in front of me after it opened that mouth! I could see the flesh moving inside its blood red jaw, and there was a black hole right in the middle of it.</p>
 <p>“Come over quickly.”</p>
 <p>The sky disappeared from above me, turning into a blood red, and all I could hear was Laurel’s voice.</p>
 <p>“This is bad!” Gaoqin Jiuye seemed to have seen something, and he tried to pull me backwards!</p>
 <p>But it was too late. That python seemed to have a black hole in its throat, and as it opened its mouth, a massive force pulled me and Gaoqin Jiuye towards it!</p>
 <p>The both of us were hit by that force, and it felt as if there was no way to escape from that gravitational pull! It felt like there was an invisible hand in the darkness, forcefully pulling me and Gaoqin Jiuye towards the abyss!</p>
 <p>“You think of something!” I shouted at Gaoqin Jiuye as we were slowly sucked into the python’s mouth as it heaved with its rotten breath.</p>
 <p>“I can’t think of anything. You have any ideas?” Gaoqin Jiuye could actually smile at me in such a situation. I really felt like beating him up!</p>
 <p>My heart sank a little. Then I shouted as loudly as I could, “Nie Zun! Jiao S!”</p>
 <p>As the words ‘Nie Zun’ came out of my mouth, I saw Gaoqin Jiuye’s face instantly turn cold.</p>
 <p>“Don’t look for me to save you if you end up in danger later,” he said coldly.</p>
 <p><em>Hell, what is wrong with you?!</em></p>
 <p>While complaining inwardly to myself about Gaoqin Jiuye’s crazy mood swings, the both of us were already sucked into the python’s throat.</p>
 <p>As we were dropping into the stomach of the giant python, I shouted at Gaoqin Jiuye, “Do you think we’d still be able to heal if we were digested by the python’s stomach acids?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye answered me with silence.</p>
 <p>With that, we continued dropping into the humid darkness.</p>
 <p>Thud!</p>
 <p>“Aiyo!” <em>That was painful!</em></p>
 <p><em>Why was this python’s stomach hard like bricks? I almost snapped my neck!</em></p>
 <p>Feeling my head in a weird position, I felt around my neck with my hands.</p>
 <p>Crack!</p>
 <p>I twisted my neck back to its original position!</p>
 <p><em>Right, time to open my eyes!</em></p>
 <p>In a daze, I opened my eyes.</p>
 <p>There was nothing but white.</p>
 <p><em>Where’s this place?</em></p>
 <p>I moved my arms and waited for my body to heal as I attached a broken leg back, propping myself up into a sitting position.</p>
 <p>The white ceramic tiles on the floor felt cold. Looking up, it was also white.</p>
 <p><em>Bloody hell, where is this? This isn’t the python’s stomach!</em></p>
 <p><em>Wait, something felt familiar…</em></p>
 <p>As I touched the ceramic floor again, my vision started to clear up, and I finally recognized this place.</p>
 <p>My heart sunk immediately. I looked around in a panic. There was no one around!</p>
 <p>“Nie Zun?!”</p>
 <p>I tried to stand, but the pain in my leg made me fall back onto the shiny floor.</p>
 <p>“Gaoqin Jiuye?!”</p>
 <p>As I was shouting, I felt a gust of strong wind from above. I looked up, only to see a white dot coming closer and closer.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?” I asked myself. Before I finally realized what was happening, the white dot crashed into me!</p>
 <p>“Ah! F***!” I sweared without caring about my image! I just couldn’t control myself!</p>
 <p>After reattaching my limbs from a high fall, I’m now hit by a person falling from the sky! The annoyance!</p>
 <p>My nose was broken, and I felt like I was being weighed down by a thousand-pound boulder that almost turned me into minced meat!</p>
 <p>“What’re you shouting for, I’m in more pain than you are…” I could hear Gaoqin Jiuye’s voice though I was still in quite a daze. My nose bridge was hurting, and I had no strength to argue with him!</p>
 <p><em>I was like a cushion for you. How could you be in more pain when you literally fell onto this live meat cushion!</em></p>
 <p>“Ow… It’s so painful!” I teared up as I touched my bloody nose, waiting for it to heal. I wanted to push Gaoqin Jiuye away, but my dislocated shoulder hurt when I tried to move! I squinted my eyes in pain.</p>
 <p>Though this pain was nothing to me now, it was still painful! I opened my eyes in anger, looking straight at Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>He was sprawled onto me.</p>
 <p>I started pinching him, and his body seemed soft, so he probably had eight to ten broken bones or so.</p>
 <p>“What’re you pinching?” His beautiful eyes squinted in a frown.</p>
 <p>“Can’t I pinch you a little when you’ve already broken my nose?</p>
 <p>“And also, when are you going to get off me?” I looked at him as I asked, without realizing that I sounded pretty much like a hooligan.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye actually blushed a little before he flipped over to the side.</p>
 <p>I found it pretty funny. <em>Gaoqin Jiuye was someone who blushed too?</em></p>
 <p>I sat up as I suddenly thought of something interesting.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Gaoqin Jiuye, there’s something I’d like to ask. What exactly are soul splitters? Have you guys always been living here in the Split Zone?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shot me a cold look.</p>
 <p>“I know you won’t answer something like this. But actually what I really want to ask is…”</p>
 <p>I blinked at him. “Do you soul splitters get married and have kids too? Do you guys mate?”</p>
 <p><em>What I didn’t realize was that the word ‘mate’ was not exactly an accurate representation of what I wanted to ask!</em></p>
 <p>“Ahem ahem, ahem!” Gaoqin Jiuye sucked in a mouthful of air as he heard my question, almost choking himself in the process!</p>
 <p>I started laughing hysterically at this.</p>
 <p>“But in all seriousness, for soul splitters, males and females still date and do that right?” Though I still didn’t know what soul splitters were exactly, they still looked human. So I guess they’d be like us. Since it was rare to see the haughty Gaoqin Jiuye flustered, I had to make use of this chance.</p>
 <p>“Ahem ahem…” As Gaoqin Jiuye recovered from his coughing spate, a malicious smile appeared on him as he lifted his brows. He flipped back on top of me in a second!</p>
 <p>Pinning me against the floor, a mischievous light shone in his eyes as he looked at me with a devious smile.</p>
 <p>“How about you try and see if I do that or not?”</p>
 <p>His enchanting voice sounded just like that charming voice in my memories, except that his had a rather devious quality to it.</p>
