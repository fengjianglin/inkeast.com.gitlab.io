 <p>Volume 3</p>
 <p><strong>133 Hitting the Nail on the Head</strong></p>
 <p>Jiao S and I made our way to the Academy after Mi Fu left.</p>
 <p>Si Luo and Gaoqin Jiuye have been staying in the same room in this period of time. It’s no wonder Guan Nie left. I could almost imagine that heartbroken expression on his pretty face.</p>
 <p>But there is nothing to be done about it. This was Gaoqin Jiuye’s choice.</p>
 <p>Just like how I was infatuated with Gao Qi, it was something uncontrollable that could not be altered.</p>
 <p>Jiao S seemed to look slightly nervous as we were about to knock on the door. I guess she was like this as we were going to see Si Luo. It looked like she had not met Si Luo on her own while I was still on the rooftop. If she did, it would not have been often. I wonder if she felt better with my company.</p>
 <p>I pushed the door open after I heard Si Luo’s clear voice, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>As the rooms in the Split Zone were all designed in the same way, I naturally looked towards the bunk beds beside the window. Si Luo was seated on the bottom bunk. And Gaoqin Jiuye…</p>
 <p>I looked around and finally saw him near the wall, opposite Si Luo.</p>
 <p>He was leaning casually against the wall. That arrogance of his probably prevented him from asking Jie Pa for some clean clothes, because his bright yellow sneakers were still stained with dirt and blood.</p>
 <p>He looked distant, shifting his gaze from Si Luo to me. I immediately thought of Nie Zun as I looked at that lonely figure against the wall.</p>
 <p><em>Has Nie Zun always been like this, standing in front of me like a protector and keeping me company in the Split Zone?</em></p>
 <p><em>Why did I not notice it all this while? </em>My heart hurt at this thought.</p>
 <p><em>Why did you have to leave if you had kept me company for such a long time? Was it because I always ignored you and you finally couldn’t stand it? Or was it like they said, you got injured, but did you have to leave because of that? Don’t you trust me?</em></p>
 <p>“Does the Western District Commander love daydreaming so much that you can do it anywhere regardless of time and place?” Gaoqin Jiuye raised his brows, looking at me sharply.</p>
 <p>My brows furrowed slightly. <em>Is he still holding a grudge against me?</em></p>
 <p><em>But why did he have to hate me? Firstly, Si Luo isn’t dead, and secondly, I’m sure Jie Pa would have treated them well as guests here. The ones who hurt my Western District residents and Nie Zun were them, so what did he have to hold a grudge against?</em></p>
 <p><em>Moreover, he’s the soul splitter who captured me. Now that he’s revealed himself, I should be the one holding a grudge against him. Why is he getting angry first?</em></p>
 <p>“I’m afraid no one would be in the mood for anything once they meet a party-pooper like you,” I said sarcastically. Gaoqin Jiuye did not respond.</p>
 <p>I looked at Si Luo, not bothering to continue the conversation.</p>
 <p>Si Luo’s silvery-white eyes were glowing faintly, and he looked like he was being enshrouded in soft, white light in his white robes.</p>
 <p>“Seems like you’ve recovered well.” I smiled at him, seeing how he looked much better than before.</p>
 <p>He nodded. “Yes, I didn’t expect it either. I wonder if it’s the air here in the Western District, I’ve been recovering really well these few days.”</p>
 <p>“Does this mean there’s no longer any need for Mr Gaoqin Jiuye here to chase after me and make an attempt on Mi Fu’s life?” Gaoqin Jiuye’s pompous look was at the back of my mind, and I had to take a stab at him whenever I said something.</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled elegantly. “If I’m healthy, then that wouldn’t be needed. Even if my condition worsens, I’ll guarantee you they’ll stop troubling you, how’s that?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo was actually willing to compromise on this.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was not as understanding as Si Luo on this, and he spoke, “Don’t even think about that. If your condition worsens, whether it’s that little girl’s life or her life, I’ll personally take them!”</p>
 <p>He shot a cold look at me as he said ‘her life’. Anger welled up in me. <em>Did I offend you?!</em></p>
 <p>Looking at this, although Gaoqin Jiuye is loyal to Si Luo, he might not listen to everything Si Luo says. As long as he thinks something is beneficial to Si Luo, it looks like even Si Luo cannot stop him from doing what he wants to.</p>
 <p>Si Luo turned serious, but that beautiful face of his made every kind of expression look good.</p>
 <p>“Gaoqin, I’ll tell you seriously. You know I’ve promised Mi Fu’s older brother to take care of Mi Fu and keep her safe. This is the reason why I’ve made her the Southern District’s goddess, so that everyone has to respect and protect her. Have you forgotten?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo and Guan Nie both seem to address Gaoqin Jiuye as Gaoqin.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes turned gentle as he looked at Si Luo. “I know, and I’ve also made a promise to you. But you know me, how could I simply look on and do nothing when your life is on tenterhooks? If Huan Qing isn’t able to find a new body of consciousness, I’ll definitely be taking that girl.”</p>
 <p>Si Luo sighed softly, his silvery-white eyes shining.</p>
 <p>“Huan Qing and I will definitely find a new body of consciousness.” Jiao S spoke her first words since entering the room.</p>
 <p>I was sure that those two, like me, could hear constrain and nervousness in her voice, which was a rare thing.</p>
 <p>Her voice was already hoarse and low-pitched. Now that she is trying to sound calm, she was trying to keep her pitch steady throughout, and this made it sound even stiffer than it usually was.</p>
 <p>I glanced at her. She was still, not moving an inch, but her trembling gaze revealed her nervousness.</p>
 <p>I sighed inwardly. There was always something that could beat you in this world. I never expected Jiao S to be this nervous.</p>
 <p>“Huh, why should I believe you? Just because you’re never going to give up on your love for Si Luo?” Gaoqin Jiuye smirked.</p>
 <p>This hurt, and Jiao S eyes wavered. Si Luo’s eyes shone with a dim light, as if it was a shallow lake, but mysterious at the same time.</p>
 <p>I could not stand Gaoqin Jiuye’s conceited attitude. <em>If you can stay beside Si Luo like this, why can’t we persevere in our own beliefs?</em></p>
 <p>I scoffed. “Aren’t you also sticking to Si Luo all the time? At least Jiao S would never do anything that Si Luo doesn’t wish for. You, on the other hand, want to go against his wishes and take the life of Mi Fu, putting him in a position where people would look down upon. Do you think that’s very noble of you?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shot me a cold look. “So what? Looked down upon by others? Li Shen, you think you’re still living in your world? This is Split Zone 13 where the strong survive. May I ask who would dare to look down upon Si Luo? Who can look down on him?”</p>
 <p>My lips twitched in a smirk. “Oh yes, I almost forgot you guys are soul splitters and different from us. You’ve always seen these dirty sins and dealings as noble acts, or why else would you guys capture us?”</p>
 <p>Instead of arguing, Gaoqin Jiuye remained silent, and pain flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled widely. “Seems like you have a deep misunderstanding of soul splitters, but that’s understandable. From what I know, it’s also survival of the fittest in your world, and it’s common for people to backstab others. In the Split Zone however, these deeds are brought above the table. Do you prefer a world that is steeped in fake kindness, or this city that is openly full of sin?”</p>
 <p>He changed the subject from what Jiao S said about finding a way to save him as he spoke, effectively turning it into a conversation with me. But I noticed the quick look he gave Jiao S.</p>
 <p>Pale moonlight shone from those silvery-white eyes of his, and I was able to witness that quick glance he gave Jiao S. I wonder what Jiao S is to him. It was probably not easy to walk into the heart of this perfect person.</p>
 <p>Just like how I felt Gao Qi was perfect when I was alive.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it that way, I could understand much of how Jiao S was feeling.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter if I like it or not. I’m not courting death, so I’ll be trying my best to stay alive. You naturally can’t choose your plane of existence when you’re alive, so it doesn’t matter if I like it or not. Just like how we were forcefully captured here, you guys have never asked for our opinions when you did all that, so what’s the point of asking now?” I raised my brows in sarcasm.</p>
 <p>Si Luo’s gaze was inscrutable. “You seem different after activating your split symbol. You seem fiercer, more hostile. Though this should be a good thing, but it’s a little too much, and you look like you won’t care even if you got hurt in the process. If I’m right, I’m guessing this has something to do with that monster in your heart. Just what triggered that monster to break away from its restraints? Was it Nie Zun?”</p>
 <p>He hit the nail on the head, and it was a clean stab to my heart with every single word he said. <em>Are you saying this because you looked into my heart? Or could you see that monster which would sometimes appear beside me?</em></p>
 <p><em>If you can’t, don’t talk about it like you know how I feel. We’re both lonely people, just like you and Gaoqin Jiuye, Jiao S and Nie Zun. Since everyone is the same, why do we doubt one another like that?</em></p>
 <p><em>We always put up our defences when someone tries to pry.</em></p>
 <p>I gave him an icy look. “There’s no need for the Southern District Commander to worry about such issues. You should instead be thinking about how to save your own life.”</p>
