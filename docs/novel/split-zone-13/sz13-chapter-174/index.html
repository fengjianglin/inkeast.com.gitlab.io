 <p>Volume 3</p>
 <p><strong>174 You Ji’s Death</strong></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye remained silent, keeping his eyes on Du Yue.</p>
 <p>He then drew Shen Qi from his waist, pointing it at Du Yue. “Tell me, where’s Cang Ming and the rest?”</p>
 <p>His choice was crystal clear.</p>
 <p>Wiping away blood from the corner of my lips, I bent down to pick Piercer up from the ground. A bitter cold shot through my palm all the way to my heart as I picked it up.</p>
 <p>Facing Du Yue, I enunciated each word as I said, “Heal You Ji’s injuries.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue glanced at You Ji who was crouched on the ground. “Li Shen, I’ll be honest with you. She’s dying. You should’ve felt it from her split symbol, her life force is diminishing. All experimental subjects will not be able to heal, and they can only endure whatever their bodies could withstand in the real world. Her injuries are serious, and since she has already been turned into an experimental subject, there’s no way to save her.”</p>
 <p>I knew anger could solve nothing, so all I could do was point at her. I have never been more resolute as I spoke, “Right, don’t save her then. I, Li Shen, swear that if You Ji dies today, I’m going to personally kill you. I’ll find you wherever you are.”</p>
 <p>I bent down to help You Ji up after that, not taking another look at Du Yue. I could feel You Ji trembling while she leaned against me. It seemed like she was enduring immense pain.</p>
 <p>She looked around, but she could not see me with those black holes that had replaced her eyes. I then slowly pulled apart the black lines which sewed her mouth shut. Her mouth was already full of blood as I took it out, but I knew I had to do this, I knew she had something to say.</p>
 <p>Her voice was coarse and raspy. If I didn’t look at her, I wouldn’t have known it was her.</p>
 <p>She said, “Is it… Ah Shen…”</p>
 <p>She called me Ah Shen.</p>
 <p>My eyes welled up with tears, but I tried not to let any of them fall.</p>
 <p>I will never cry in front of Du Yue.</p>
 <p>“It’s me,” I answered croakily.</p>
 <p>You Ji’s arms started flailing about, and I grabbed her hand.</p>
 <p>She looked at me with those gaping holes where her eyes should have been, as if tears of blood could drip out anytime. “Ah Shen, I was jealous of you… Because I love Mr Blond… I did all this to look for him… I’m no longer able to achieve my goal… Can you promise me that you’ll find him for me…”</p>
 <p>I squeezed her hand tightly. “Alright, I promise. I’ll definitely find him.”</p>
 <p>After I spoke, You Ji’s arm slackened.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t like a television drama where we had some extra time with each other. She just died in my arms. Her body turned into light as it disappeared slowly.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t believe that this was the intelligent You Ji who had betrayed me the last time I saw her.</p>
 <p>This time, I’ll never be able to see her again.</p>
 <p>“This is the first time you’ve witnessed the death of someone close to you, right? Sadly, there’ll be more of this happening if you go against me. I know what kind of person you are, Li Shen. Do you really think a weakling like you can hold your ground against me?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue seemed like an arrogant goddess, looking down upon me.</p>
 <p>Jiao S walked over to my side, helping me up. Her eyes had a resolute gaze as she looked at me. It seemed like she was telling me that it’s fine, that we’ll avenge her.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was still holding Shen Qi in his hand. “Du Yue, you’ve really changed. Is this all because of Ta Lai?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue grabbed Shen Qi’s blade with her bare hand. “I’ve always been like this. Gaoqin, you and I are the same. Have you forgotten why you fell in love with me? Because you know that we’re the same! Stop running away from it. Cruel acts are merely child’s play to you and I, and sympathy will only make you weak.”</p>
 <p>Bian Ying ran over to Jiao S and I, and she turned and shouted at Du Yue, “You’re insane! You’ve gone crazy in loving Ta Lai! These people are innocent; take me as your target!”</p>
 <p>“Take you as my target? Who do you think you are?!” Incensed at Bian Ying’s words, Du Yue bent Shen Qi’s tip towards Bian Ying!</p>
 <p>Shen Qi was a flexible sword, and with Du Yue’s movement, it’s tip was now facing Bian Ying!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye obviously did not anticipate that Du Yue would do something like this when his sword was already pointing at her face. In the time that she used to bend the tip, Gaoqin Jiuye could have cut her hand off easily if he had raised his sword.</p>
 <p>But it was clear that she knew Gaoqin Jiuye would never do that. However, that doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t do something Gaoqin Jiuye won’t!</p>
 <p>I leapt forward to grab Shen Qi’s blade somewhere closer to the hilt. I didn’t blink an eye even when I felt the piercing pain of its sharp blade cutting into my palm!</p>
 <p>Du Yue’s hand was already dripping with blood where the blade had cut into her palm. We looked at each other, neither of us having any intention of backing off!</p>
 <p>Looking at the situation, Gaoqin Jiuye focused his MF on Shen Qi.</p>
 <p>There were three sources of MF on Shen Qi now.</p>
 <p>Du Yue glanced at Gaoqin Jiuye, then back at me, before a victorious smile appeared on her lips. She looked extremely sure that even though Gaoqin Jiuye will not help her, he would not wish for her death either.</p>
 <p>But she seems to have overestimated me on this. I’m not about to go solo against her.</p>
 <p>I called out loudly for Jiao S, “Jiao!”</p>
 <p>Jiao S knew exactly what I wanted her to do as she leapt towards us with her huge sword, swinging it towards Du Yue!</p>
 <p>With only one hand, Du Yue’s strength was now focused on Shen Qi. She wanted to retract her MF upon seeing Jiao S’s incoming attack, but I wouldn’t give her this chance! I focused all my MF on my hand and Shen Qi as I tried to stall her. Gaoqin Jiuye’s expression darkened as he hesitated. I knew he would not take Shen Qi back rashly in this moment, since both our hands were still on it, bloodied by its blade.</p>
 <p>As Jiao S’s sword was about to reach its target, a long and slender arm appeared to block it!</p>
 <p>I was upset about this sudden turn of events. Looking at the jade stone ring on that hand, I knew who it was immediately!</p>
 <p>Jiao S’s head tilted, doubt apparent in those big eyes of hers.</p>
 <p>I looked at Ta Lai, who was now in between Jiao S and I. “I don’t understand what’s happening now. You’re stopping us when she’s here to kill your lover, Bian Ying? What’re you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>Ta Lai had that composed smile on his face as he pushed Jiao S’s sword down with his MF. “Because she isn’t here to kill Bian Ying.”</p>
 <p><em>Not here to kill Bian Ying?</em></p>
 <p><em>That’s right, why didn’t I think of this. Although Du Yue hates Bian Ying, why would she suddenly want to kill her if she didn’t hurt her in all these years? Also, this territory in the Gate of Ghost doesn’t belong to her either.</em></p>
 <p><em>If so, then why did she come here to the Gate of Ghost?</em></p>
 <p>As I was lost in my thoughts, Du Yue let go of Shen Qi. Without her grabbing the tip of the sword, Gaoqin Jiuye and I naturally stepped backwards. Jiao S retreated to my side as Ta Lai had also let go of her sword.</p>
 <p>Bian Ying walked up, looking at Ta Lai with unfathomable eyes, not saying a word.</p>
 <p>I thought there would be a change in Ta Lai when he saw Bian Ying, but he looked as calm and composed as ever. It seemed like he didn’t even take one look at Bian Ying.</p>
 <p>I was confused at this.<em> Even if Du Yue wasn’t here to kill Bian Ying, Ta Lai still shouldn’t be on Du Yue’s side. Or is this because he wants to take my other personality, and he’ll work with whoever can help him do so?</em></p>
 <p>Du Yue was fearless with Ta Lai around. “Gaoqin Jiuye, I’m sure you’ve also heard of that cave where Cang Ming was headed. Looking at how much time has passed, he’s probably not gone too deep into it. It’s also likely he doesn’t know what’s happening yet. You just might be able to save him if you can find the cave and find him soon.”</p>
 <p>Her cunning eyes were full of malice. “You might not care about whether he lives or dies, and you might think that he and Nie Zun would think of a way to escape from that cave, but don’t forget that Guan Nie and Si Luo are both with them now, and they’re both not conscious. Even if Cang Ming can save Guan Nie, he won’t be able to wake Si Luo. What do you think is the probability of those three escaping from that cave with another person who’s as good as dead?”</p>
 <p>Jiao S stared at Gaoqin Jiuye after she heard Du Yue. “Why did you bring Si Luo in? You know very well that only Yu Liang can save Si Luo now, so why did you still do that?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes darkened. “It’s not that I did it, it’s just that the air currents near that cave were extremely uneven, and it’s different from that in the Eastern, Southern and Western Districts. I wasn’t able to control the air vortex that carried Si Luo well enough, and when I let Si Luo out, they just suddenly got sucked into that cave.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked. “Of course you’d think that was sudden. It was all planned by me. You haven’t forgotten that you were never able to win me, right?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye did not respond.</p>
 <p>I felt a little indignant at this. <em>When did Gaoqin Jiuye become like this?</em></p>
 <p><em>Where did that arrogance go? Why was he such a coward in front of Du Yue?!</em></p>
 <p>I stared at Gaoqin Jiuye angrily, but he simply looked into the distance as if he was in deep thought.&nbsp;<em>Why is he daydreaming at such a moment!</em></p>
 <p>Du Yue gained confidence as she saw Gaoqin Jiuye’s expression. “Well, you just might be able to save them if you go look for them now and stop them from going further into that cave.”</p>
 <p>Jiao S interrupted Du Yue. “If you’re talking so much even after planning all this perfectly, I’m guessing you probably didn’t expect for Gaoqin Jiuye to be able to escape and return here. You’re doing all this to divert his attention, right? You’re not here for Bian Ying, you’re here for Ah Shen.”</p>
