 <p><strong>98&nbsp;I am The Devil</strong></p>
 <p>“No use thinking about it too much now, let’s just see how it goes. We’ll be back when it’s time.” Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes were bright and clear.</p>
 <p>I sighed inwardly as I looked at the only person I can communicate with in this world. He was my enemy just a while ago.</p>
 <p><em>Gao Qi, our relationship really is complicated...</em></p>
 <p>“Let's go, I’ll show you around,” I said as I brushed my hair.</p>
 <p>We finally arrived at my university after crossing the street.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes brightened as if he saw something novel. That vibrant expression of his brought a smile to my face. It was rare that he had such a lively demeanor.</p>
 <p>As we walked into the university, Gaoqin Jiuye stopped to look at almost everything.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t go to class and the lecturer had to take attendance today. What luck,” a girl was complaining to another female student as she passed.</p>
 <p>I felt a moment of despair.</p>
 <p>Going to class… that phrase seems so distant now. I did not know how to cherish being alive before I died, and ended up in the Split Zone. Even if you are not happy being alive, you should still press on.</p>
 <p>To be alive is to be blessed, it is something to be so grateful for that one should be crying tears of joy.<em> But I took away the right to live from the person I love.</em></p>
 <p>As I thought of this, I quietly looked over at Gaoqin Jiuye, who was curiously looking at the flowers in the school grounds.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?” Gaoqin Jiuye asked while pointing at a tulip.</p>
 <p>“That’s a tulip,” my gaze lingered on him as I casually answered.</p>
 <p>His eyes seemed to shine. “Tu...lip? She has a name? It sounds nice.”</p>
 <p>My thoughts were filled with Gao Qi, and I did not wonder too much about why he did not know what are tulips, and why he was so curious about a single flower.</p>
 <p>Many years later I kept asking myself, if I had felt something was wrong today, would things have been different?</p>
 <p>What a pity that we cannot turn back time, nor can we foresee the future.</p>
 <p>“I know I’m good-looking, but you don’t have to keep looking at me with such a starved expression,” Gaoqin Jiuye said while waving a hand in front of my face.</p>
 <p><em>Narcissist…</em> As I wanted to roll my eyes, I coincidentally caught sight of someone walking not far behind Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>Almost as if struck by lightning, I was rooted to the ground in shock. My heart instantly felt like it was being branded and scorched, while I remained stunned and motionless.</p>
 <p>He was in the warm sunlight, and he walked unhurriedly. His back did not look as sturdy as before, his face was slightly pale, and I could not decipher his thoughts behind those dark, hazel eyes.</p>
 <p>A warm and gentle smile was on his lips, but his gaze was frosty.</p>
 <p>He was still in the same sportswear, and he was wearing a pair of bright yellow sneakers.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s clear voice sounded beside me, as if overlapping with the person I just saw.</p>
 <p>“What are you looking at?”</p>
 <p>My eyes finally moved back to Gaoqin Jiuye’s face.</p>
 <p>They were exactly the same, but Gaoqin Jiuye’s was comparatively more vibrant and menacing, while his expression was rather cold.</p>
 <p>Tears started to well up in my eyes, and Gaoqin Jiuye followed my gaze, looking back.</p>
 <p>“This...” Gaoqin Jiuye sounded surprised, but he did not seem that shocked.</p>
 <p>At that point, my tears were already falling and I rushed towards Gao Qi hysterically, no longer caring about Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>“Gao, Gao Qi! You’re not dead! You’re not dead right?!” I cried and whimpered as I tried to hold him, but I realised once again that I could not touch him at all.</p>
 <p>“A dream? Is this a dream? Can you see me? Are you really alive?” My entire face was wet with tears.</p>
 <p>However, he could not see me at all.</p>
 <p>He continued walking forward, slowly and unhurriedly.</p>
 <p>His beautiful brows furrowed slightly, it was not relaxed like before, and he looked as if he was enduring some sort of pain. His pale lips were also pursed into a straight line.</p>
 <p>“This is the lover you killed before you died, the one who looked like me?” Gaoqin Jiuye ran beside me, looking at Gao Qi with interest.</p>
 <p>Both of us activated our MF as we backed away while Gao Qi walked towards us.</p>
 <p>“It is exactly the same.”</p>
 <p>My tears were still falling. “Gao Qi, you’re alright now, right? Were you saved?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye grabbed me, and looked at me with slight blame in his eyes. “It’s obvious that he isn’t dead, what are you still crying for?”</p>
 <p>I flung his hand away and did not bother to look at him, solely focusing on Gao Qi’s face. “Why do you look so pale...”</p>
 <p>Gao Qi did not look at me, and Gaoqin Jiuye grabbed my hand again, lifting my arm, staring intensely at me. “You are already dead in this world, he won’t hear anything you say!”</p>
 <p>I stubbornly looked at him, allowing my tears to flow. “I still want to speak to him. It’s none of your business.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes dimmed. “Don’t you feel that I’m him now?”</p>
 <p>I stared at him, and looked at Gao Qi’s face.</p>
 <p>I laughed bitterly. “Even if I wanted to deceive myself, fact is you are not him no matter how much you look alike!”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye laughed icily, and with a sharp gaze, he tightened his grip on my arm. “It’s that no matter how much he looks like me, he is still not me! Don’t get that order wrong!”</p>
 <p>I scoffed, “That’s what you think. I’ve never gotten the order wrong!”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked outraged, and forcibly dragged me towards Gao Qi, who had now moved a distance away. He pointed at Gao Qi with one hand as he dragged me with the other. “Look clearly now, he can’t even sense your presence! You are already dead in this world!”</p>
 <p>I bit my lips and remained silent.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi stopped in his tracks abruptly, as if sensing something.</p>
 <p>Both Gaoqin Jiuye and I stopped moving. I looked at Gao Qi’s face, not daring to breathe.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi turned back slightly, and his gaze swept past me without stopping.</p>
 <p>Finally, his gaze landed on my face.</p>
 <p>I was breathless.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s hand, which was holding onto my arm, also seemed to be frozen.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi’s pale lips slowly widened into a smile, his eyes were warm and gentle. “Haven’t met in a while.”</p>
 <p>I was speechless. He, he, he, he can see me now?</p>
 <p>As I was still in shock and waiting for an answer, I saw Gaoqin Jiuye’s gaze focus on something behind me.</p>
 <p>Before I could turn back, a hand came out of my chest! That hand seemed to pass through my torso from the back with great force, and it was lifted high in front of my face!</p>
 <p>Smack!</p>
 <p>The hand that came out of my chest slapped Gao Qi!</p>
 <p>I moved aside in surprise, and finally turned to look.</p>
 <p>It was Pomelo!</p>
 <p>Pomelo was not in our couple wear, and she was wearing a high-necked sweater. She was a lot thinner, and her eyes looked distant and tired.</p>
 <p>“No!” I wanted to grab her hand, but I could only watch as she gave Gao Qi a slap.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi’s pale face did not turn red even after being slapped, instead, he looked more pale and sickly.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi’s smile remained, and he kept his eyes on Pomelo.</p>
 <p>“Why are you not dead yet. If you don’t die, how can you still face her?” Pomelo’s voice was frigid.</p>
 <p>Gao Qi’s gave a bitter smile. “I wish I was the one lying there instead.”</p>
 <p>Hatred flashed past Pomelo’s eyes. “Don’t pretend to be kind! Didn’t think that you would survive. That heart of yours is rather tenacious!”</p>
 <p>Gao Qi looked to be in agony. He looked different from before, when he looked mysterious but gentle. He put a hand over his heart. “It was able to heal after being stabbed, but, why do I feel as if I’m never going to heal.”</p>
 <p>This was heart-wrenching. I watched him miserably with tearful eyes.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, he could not see me. His unfocused gaze was still on Pomelo.</p>
 <p>Pomelo burst out laughing suddenly. “Gao Qi, why are you pretending to be nice? You have always been a sacred being to her, but I know what kind of person you really are. I know people like you well, and those who get involved with you will end up addicted, unable to tear themselves away from you. I tried all ways and means to get her away from you, but I wasn’t able to stop you from destroying her!”</p>
 <p>I started screaming at Pomelo, “Go away! Who are you to say these things to him?! Stop acting! What are you talking about?!”</p>
 <p>I could no longer keep my emotions in check, and nothing made sense to me here. <em>Just what is the truth? Are we back in reality? Why is he alive, and why is she saying such things to him when he is still alive? I had no idea what is happening!</em></p>
 <p><em>But I didn’t want to understand it either! I could still see Gao Qi… What should I be unhappy about?!</em></p>
 <p><em>Even if I see him alive, can this make up for all the harm I have caused him?!</em></p>
 <p><em>I, Li Shen, am still a devil who will kill the one I love when crazed!</em></p>
