 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>196 I Like You</strong></p>
 <p>“Since we’re all here now, I think it’s time someone explain all that’s happening so far.” I tried my best to sound calm and composed as I looked around me.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Du Yue answered. “Are you interested to come with me to my Palace of Cold Blood?”</p>
 <p><em>Tch, Palace of Cold Blood. The name suits you really well, Du Yue… </em>My mind started racing as I thought about the sudden change in her attitude towards me.</p>
 <p>Du Yue was different from Li Wen in that she doesn’t usually lie to trick you in doing anything. Though she’s ruthless, she does everything openly and doesn’t hide. She’s also very confident in her own abilities. If she wanted to hurt me, she can easily do it now instead of using extra time to take me elsewhere.</p>
 <p>She must have her reasons for doing so. <em>Was I of any use to her?</em></p>
 <p>I recalled that Li Wen said I was the only one who could kill soul splitters. <em>Did Du Yue know this too? Did she want to use me as well?</em></p>
 <p>“Why should I leave with you?” I had to ask even if it sounded a little retarded.</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked. “Jiao S is in the Palace of Cold Blood right now.”</p>
 <p><em>As expected of her.</em></p>
 <p>I turned around, expecting Li Wen to disagree. However, Gaoqin Jiuye placed Si Luo aside and he was the one who said, “You can’t take her with you.”</p>
 <p>I was stunned at this.</p>
 <p>Du Yue asked calmly, “Why is that?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye smirked. “Because she’s mine. Whether it’s you or Li Wen, don’t even think about taking what’s mine.”</p>
 <p>I looked at Gaoqin Jiuye in surprise. There seemed to be a light shining from behind Gaoqin Jiuye, making it look very much like the first time I met Gao Qi.</p>
 <p>I rubbed my eyes as I mumbled, “Gao Qi…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s smile froze as he looked at me. “I’m not Gao Qi, I’m Gaoqin Jiuye, and you’re mine.”</p>
 <p>Deep in my heart, something exploded.</p>
 <p>What was it? I don’t know.</p>
 <p>“Are you confessing to Ah Shen now?” Li Wen asked. Du Yue shot her a cold look.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me squarely, a mischievous smile still hanging on his lips.</p>
 <p>Though I wanted to avoid those eyes which felt like they were boring into me, I chose to meet his gaze. “What are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye said, “I said, I like you. You’re mine. No one can take you.”</p>
 <p>Something exploded in my heart once again. No matter how calm I was, the tips of my fingers were trembling now.</p>
 <p>I looked him in the eye. These eyes and this face, how familiar everything seemed to be. <em>How long have I waited for him to say this?</em></p>
 <p><em>But, did he really not say this before?</em></p>
 <p>My heart seemed to be scrunching itself up. Pain seemed to travel across all my blood vessels and congregate in my heart, making me feel as if I was about to be destroyed.</p>
 <p><em>This was something I hoped for, but why did it feel so familiar when it happened? </em>Something seemed to be reappearing in my memories.</p>
 <p><em>“Ah Shen, I like you. Die together with me.”</em></p>
 <p>I lifted my arms slowly and covered both my ears, trying to block out that enchanting voice in my head which kept telling me, <em>Ah Shen, come with me. I like you. Let’s die together.</em></p>
 <p>Seeing me like this, a deep sorrow seemed to fill Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>Li Wen rushed forward to grab my hand, interrupting that voice in my head. She looked at me with fire in her eyes. “Has she appeared? Your second personality?”</p>
 <p>Her words were like a sudden bucket of ice water being tipped over me.</p>
 <p>I pushed her away. “No, don’t even think about it. I’ll never see her again, so don’t even think about making use of her, ever.</p>
 <p>“And you.” I pointed at Du Yue. “You think I don’t know what you’re planning? You already know who I am, and all of you want to make use of my second personality. Dream on. I won’t let anyone take control of her. No one can control her anyway.”</p>
 <p>I then laughed mercilessly.</p>
 <p>Du Yue remained calm like still water. She glanced at Gaoqin Jiuye. “The one you like gets agitated so easily. Seems like you really don’t have much taste.”</p>
 <p>I smirked. “Is that so, he doesn’t have much taste? Why did I hear that he liked you before?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue’s gaze wavered as she looked at Gaoqin Jiuye. Gaoqin Jiuye did not meet her eyes. He looked at me and said, “I like you now, and I won’t let anyone else take you away from me.”</p>
 <p>He said it exactly like this, as if it was romantic. But I saw an endless agony buried deep within his eyes.</p>
 <p>I finally got it. He was using me as some kind of shield.</p>
 <p><em>Haha.</em> A bittersweet smile appeared on my face.</p>
 <p>Li Wen looked at all of us before her gaze landed on Du Yue. “Right, where’s Bian Ying and Ta Lai?”</p>
 <p>This was a normal question, since there was Ta Lai, Bian Ying, Du Yue and Jiao S in that river when we left. However, a killing intent appeared in Du Yue’s eyes. It seems as if her jealousy is enough to kill anyone who put the names Ta Lai and Bian Ying together in the same sentence.</p>
 <p>“Cang Ming appeared from out of nowhere and took Bian Ying away.” Du Yue answered Li Wen coldly.</p>
 <p>“How about Ta Lai?” Li Wen’s eyes seemed to smile.</p>
 <p>Du Yue stared at her as she said, “He’s returned to the Gate of Heaven.”</p>
 <p>Li Wen smiled. “You sure he’s back in the Gate of Heaven? He didn’t cook up an excuse for you and go looking for Bian Ying instead?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue’s patience seemed to end here. She lifted a hand and gave it a big wave.</p>
 <p>That feeling was back.</p>
 <p>The ground seemed to become magnetic and my heart felt like it was a piece of iron. My heart felt like it was being sucked downwards, causing me to fall face-down onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked before she lifted her right foot and stepped onto my head.</p>
 <p>A painful pressure was on my head, and that feeling of my heart being sucked towards the ground did not lessen a tiny bit. My heart felt like it was about to escape from my chest and stick itself to the ground.</p>
 <p>My hands were on the ground as I attempted to get up. However, I couldn’t escape this force no matter how hard I tried.</p>
 <p>Moreover, there was still a foot on my head.</p>
 <p>I laughed self-mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Let go of her.” I heard Gaoqin Jiuye’s glacial voice from the top of my head.</p>
 <p>Du Yue used more force on her foot. The side of my face was on the ground, and she was stepping on my right ear. I couldn’t hear their conversation very clearly like this.</p>
 <p>Du Yue seemed to ignore Gaoqin Jiuye and addressed Li Wen instead. “Isn’t she your goal? I can tell you now that I’m taking her life for sure. Does Li Qing dare to have you go against me? How about you ask her first?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye grabbed Du Yue’s hand, making her unsteady for a moment. The pressure on my head seemed to lessen by a fraction, but her hand was still held in that weird position. My heart was still stuck to some unknown force from the ground.</p>
 <p>“Did you not hear me clearly? I said she’s mine. Don’t even think about taking her away from me,” Gaoqin Jiuye said to Du Yue.</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked. “Gaoqin, have you forgotten that we grew up together? Do you think I wouldn’t know you well enough? You only look and act fierce. In reality, you aren’t as cruel as you look. If you were cruel enough, you wouldn’t have ended up leaving the Gate of Heaven together with Si Luo at that time.”</p>
 <p>These people were really enjoying their conversation. There seemed to be no conclusion on the part about taking me away either. Seems like it’s time for me to cut their conversation short.</p>
 <p>I focused all my MF on my heart. Something then answered from deep within it. That answer seemed to be coming from something buried in my heart that was finally being awoken.</p>
 <p>I grabbed her right foot in my right hand as I continued focusing MF on my heart.</p>
 <p>Boom.</p>
 <p>I stood up the instant I escaped from that unknown force, backing away quickly. Swinging my right hand, I threw Du Yue’s leg to the side.</p>
 <p>I smirked at her. “Seems like not all heirs are like insects.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue was visibly shocked at my escape. Though I had ripped one of her legs off, she was able to stand perfectly steady on one. “How could you have escaped from my restraining technique?”</p>
 <p>So that was called the restraining technique.</p>
 <p>I shrugged. “You guys said it before, that the only thing giving you power in the Split Zone is MF and the split symbol. As long as your mental endurance is strong enough, there’s nothing that cannot be broken here. Put simply, I’m stronger and can endure much more now. You can’t do anything to me.”</p>
 <p>I looked at Du Yue indignantly. <em>Know your abilities before you even try to take my life.&nbsp;</em><em>I can give up on myself, I can avoid things and remain cowardly, but I never said I’d let you guys order me around like this.</em></p>
 <p><em>Since I’ve become a weapon in your war, this means my life is worth something now. Come and get it if that’s the case. It’s best if you guys destroy each other. This way, I can save my friends.</em></p>
 <p><em>So many lives have been lost in the Eastern, Western and Southern Districts. I no longer know how to be afraid. I no longer know how to cry.</em></p>
 <p><em>Even Nie Zun has been taken away from me. Is this all because of the her in me?</em></p>
 <p><em>Come and get it then.</em></p>
 <p><em>I, Li Shen, will make the Split Zone a living hell. You guys owe me this much.</em></p>
