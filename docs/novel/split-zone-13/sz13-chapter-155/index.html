 <p>Volume 3</p>
 <p><strong>155 The Demon that is Nie Zun</strong></p>
 <p>“Your consciousness could actually devour the curse I planted in your eye…” Ta Lai muttered as he could not believe what he was witnessing. The black fog started to burn pieces of his skin as it surrounded him.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun’s other eye was starting to turn red as well. A bright scarlet layer enveloped his black pupil, and his pale hands continued to produce black fog. That fog surrounded his fingers, and white bones appeared from where he lost those three fingers!</p>
 <p>The white from the bones were in sharp contrast with that black fog, and I could see the flesh melding around it and knitting together at amazing speed!</p>
 <p>From the cold stone ground, I looked at Nie Zun’s hand. By now, it had already regenerated fully. In less than a minute, that hand already looked perfect, and there were no scars on it.</p>
 <p>A demonic light shone in Nie Zun’s eyes as that black fog surrounded his hands. He looked like a jet black shadow enshrouded in a dark mist. That black fog created a shadowy layer, covering the gray sky and bringing with it a sense of impending doom.</p>
 <p>Only Ta Lai’s head could be seen now as his entire body was already encased within the black fog. I could hear a crackling sound, as if he was being roasted. He looked like he wanted to cry out, but with a slight movement of Nie Zun’s left index finger, a monstrous face appeared in the black fog. Going around Ta Lai’s neck with a roar, it prevented Ta Lai from producing any sound.</p>
 <p>Ta Lai’s eyes were becoming wider and wider, as if his eyeballs were about to fall out anytime. I could hear the sound of bones being broken within that black fog, and it sounded like his bones were being smashed one by one.</p>
 <p>“Nie Zun…” As the black fog spread around the forest, I began to feel a horrifying pressure. I could not manipulate my MF very well since I did not get proper rest, and now that I was injured, I simply could not move any closer to Nie Zun. No matter how hard I tried, all I could do was wriggle on the ground like a tiny worm.</p>
 <p>The corners of my lips and eyes suddenly felt like they were being torn apart, and I attempted to prop myself up with my blood-stained hands, trying my best to reach Nie Zun.</p>
 <p>The scorpion insignia on my left wrist was flashing brightly. Nie Zun’s back was facing me, and I could only see his jet black shoes as I looked up.</p>
 <p>A hand suddenly grabbed my red dress, and before I could tell it was Gaoqin Jiuye, I was lifted up by him. He grabbed me and put a distance between us and Nie Zun. As I turned to look at him, I realized he still looked unusually pale.</p>
 <p>He was still pressing on his wound with one hand, and it seemed that his wound did not stop bleeding at all. His fingers were all stained with blood, and I could see that a lot of blood had already seeped through his trousers.</p>
 <p>As he pulled me away from Nie Zun, I saw two jet black swords in Shen Qi’s hands. He was charging towards Nie Zun!</p>
 <p>“Let go of me!” I stared at Gaoqin Jiuye angrily, but there was no strength in my voice.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me coldly as he spoke in a low voice, “Ta Lai’s curse was devoured by his consciousness. He won’t recognize anyone in this demonic state, not even you. Are you tired of living?”</p>
 <p>He was still unusually pale, and he looked rather weak right now.</p>
 <p>There was blood on strands of his hazel hair, and it stained his forehead. Under that blood-stained forehead were a pair of strong brows and a pair of evil, menacing eyes, which could at times be filled with warmth.</p>
 <p>“The more I can’t leave him like this,” I said softly, looking at him.</p>
 <p>I caught what looked like sadness flashing past Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Listen to me if you want to save him.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, I saw Shen Qi’s swords wrap themselves around Nie Zun’s monstrous hands.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun turned back. Under those wispy bangs, I could see those bright red eyes of his sweep past Shen Qi and us.</p>
 <p>A scarlet light flashed in his eyes, and his lips turned up in a cruel smile. Black fog started enshrouding Shen Qi!</p>
 <p>Shen Qi’s eyes were also red. With a wave of his hands, the two swords produced a clear sound!</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>The swords slashed into Nie Zun’s hands, severing them cleanly from the wrist!</p>
 <p>“Ah!” I covered my mouth as I took in what just happened.</p>
 <p>Though a living weapon could come alive, it was still a weapon. There was no withholding in that cruel attack!</p>
 <p>Nie Zun’s demonic hands were cut off just like this, but there was no change in his expression. His smile did not fade, and it did not even look like he felt an ounce of pain!</p>
 <p>Even weirder was that two sets of bone started growing from his wrists! Flesh was knitting together on these bones.</p>
 <p>A new pair of hands appeared in just a few seconds!</p>
 <p>As Nie Zun’s black sleeves had been slashed apart, his arm was now partially exposed!</p>
 <p>His hand regenerated at such godly speed! But the scars on his face still remained, and they did not look like they were going to heal anytime soon.</p>
 <p>I heard Gaoqin Jiuye sigh in defeat. “Seems like we’re all going to die here today.”</p>
 <p>I looked at him in shock. <em>Did you have to go and say something like this?</em></p>
 <p>“Once he loses his humanity, it would be difficult for even soul splitters to go against him.” There was strong emotion in Gaoqin Jiuye’s exhausted eyes.</p>
 <p>My expression of surprise turned cold. “Just what do you know.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye gave a menacing smile.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he grabbed my chin with the hand that was originally pressing on his wound!</p>
 <p>He wanted to press his blood-stained lips against mine!</p>
 <p>Nie Zun, who was about to attack Shen Qi, witnessed every moment of what just happened!</p>
 <p>I turned my head in the instant that I realized what Gaoqin Jiuye was trying to do! Because of this, Gaoqin Jiuye only met the corner of my lips!</p>
 <p>From Nie Zun’s perspective, it would look like we were locked in a passionate embrace as our faces were covered by that red hair of mine!</p>
 <p>“Are you trying to call upon what little humanity he still has within him?” I spoke softly in Gaoqin Jiuye’s ear.</p>
 <p>In reality, I was a little tense. He looked foreign yet familiar, and that face which originally had a cruel smile on it had just brushed past my lips with a warmth that felt so conflicting!</p>
 <p>I felt Gaoqin Jiuye’s throat move, and he tried to use his hand to adjust my head, attempting once again to press his lips against mine! Momentarily, a feeling of anxiety overcame me.</p>
 <p>As I tried to avoid it, Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me with a pair of forlorn eyes. I pursed my lips and avoided it as quickly as I could!</p>
 <p>I felt sorry for this, and I wanted to meet his gaze to convey an apology. But at this moment, a chilly laugh from Nie Zun immediately froze all of us!</p>
 <p>As I turned to look, Nie Zun had a deathly cold gaze, and a ghastly aura surrounded him! The smell of blood invaded my senses as the devil in Nie Zun had completely awoken!</p>
 <p>Not only did Gaoqin Jiuye’s method fail to bring out his humanity, it further triggered his rage!</p>
 <p>He lifted a cruel hand in the air. With a grabbing motion, a hand materialized from that black fog, capturing Shen Qi!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes darkened. He charged towards Nie Zun with great speed! White fog surged in his eyes as air currents started roaring around him!</p>
 <p>The air currents and black fog met each other in loud, thunderous clashes!</p>
 <p>Behind Nie Zun, Ta Lai was still encapsulated in that black fog. He looked like he was in pain but unable to make any sound!</p>
 <p>As Gaoqin Jiuye moved, Shen Qi had already turned back into that long, flexible sword in Gaoqin Jiuye’s hands!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was fast, and with his sword and those explosive air currents, he pushed back against Nie Zun’s demonic aura!</p>
 <p>The scarlet light in Nie Zun’s eyes was still burning brightly. With a light tap of his feet, he flew up into the air, avoiding Gaoqin Jiuye’s slashes!</p>
 <p>I was quite perplexed at this. In the end, why did it become a fight between the two of them!</p>
 <p><em>A fight between the two of them…</em></p>
 <p>As I thought of this, a horrifying scene appeared in my mind!</p>
 <p>It was the scene where Gaoqin Jiuye ruthlessly killed Nie Zun!</p>
 <p>It was that scene which appeared when Si Luo was looking into my heart!</p>
 <p>I looked on anxiously. Gaoqin Jiuye’s previously pale face now looked full of color. It was not how a gravely injured person should look like. This look was a look of a victor. He raised his sword high, slashing it towards Nie Zun!</p>
 <p>Nie Zun was a black figure with bright red eyes, and those pale hands of his made several complex signs. With those signs, the black fog started to quake and roar, encasing everything in its path!</p>
 <p>My heart sank. Without hesitation, I focused all my MF to prop myself up, and with a flick of my wrist, Piercer was back in my right palm!</p>
