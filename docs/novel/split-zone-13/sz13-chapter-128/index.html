 <p>Volume 2</p>
 <p><strong>128 The Second Personality</strong></p>
 <p>Guan Nie’s pained eyes lingered on Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>I glanced sideways at Nie Zun.</p>
 <p>Something was not right. He was very pale, and from his eyes, I could tell he was suppressing some sort of pain. He suppressed it very well, and I almost could not tell.</p>
 <p>“What’s… wrong?” I wanted to reach out to him, but he backed away, as if he was avoiding me.</p>
 <p>Guan Nie started coughing, just like Si Luo.</p>
 <p>*Cough cough cough*</p>
 <p>He then spat out a mouthful of blood!</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked slightly anxious, and tried his best to keep his voice from panicking as he held the beautiful Guan Nie in his arms. “Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>Guan Nie gave an exhausted smile. “You worry about me too…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye had a complicated expression.</p>
 <p>I could no longer be bothered with the two of them. I just found Nie Zun’s gaze becoming more and more unfocused.</p>
 <p>“Guan Nie, what did you do to Nie Zun?”</p>
 <p>I stared at Guan Nie. Ridden with anxiety, I did not realize that Guan Nie looked to be in more agony than Nie Zun was at this moment.</p>
 <p>Guan Nie smiled elegantly. “It’s not me, it’s you. Who else can break my illusion? With my pet’s ability, others might not be able to hurt him in the least. But with you by his side, he can’t help but get hurt while protecting you.</p>
 <p>“As long as he cares about you and he wants to protect you, he will not be able to protect himself.”</p>
 <p>“How about you, what did you do for him?” Nie Zun interrupted Guan Nie, pointing at Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was stunned.</p>
 <p>Guan Nie smiled, a longing in his eyes. He looked at Gaoqin Jiuye and said softly, “I can never compare to him… no matter how much I do for you…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye pursed his lips.</p>
 <p>A dark red line of blood seeped out from the corner of Guan Nie’s lips, and he looked like he was in anguish. “Why such an expression? Aren’t I right? Gaoqin, what’s so good about him? Is it because he’s more beautiful than me?”</p>
 <p>Though this was a sorrowful scene, I felt warmed.</p>
 <p>Guan Nie might be the most innocent among us all. He was infatuated with Gaoqin Jiuye, and thought that Gaoqin Jiuye cared about Si Luo more because Si Luo was more beautiful than him.</p>
 <p>A gentle warmth spread across Gaoqin Jiuye’s features as he looked at Guan Nie, though he did not speak.</p>
 <p>Guan Nie suddenly turned brutal, and he took Gaoqin Jiuye’s face in his bloody hands.</p>
 <p>“Say it, just why?</p>
 <p>“Even after spending all those lonely years with you, Gaoqin, I wasn’t able to move you, I wasn’t able to earn a place in your heart. Why did you leave with him with just a single word? You didn’t hesitate? There was nothing you missed? Why was he able to achieve something that I wasn’t able to when we’ve spent such a long time together?”</p>
 <p>Guan Nie teared up, and I was filled with pity at this. This looked like a scene where an injured but beautiful lady was crying to her lover, asking him why she was not able to move him.</p>
 <p>But what moved me was not the scene in front of me, but Guan Nie’s words.</p>
 <p><em>Why was he able to achieve something that I wasn’t able to when we’ve spent such a long time together?</em></p>
 <p><em>How many of us would have had similar thoughts?</em></p>
 <p>“Gaoqin Jiuye!” Guan Nie cried out suddenly!</p>
 <p>His eyes were filled with tears. “Gaoqin Jiuye! You’re a monster! I’m one too! I’m the only one who understands you!”</p>
 <p>With a breath, his hands fell to the ground. I only realized at this point that his wound did not heal! Gaoqin Jiuye noticed it too, and he looked like he was in a panic.</p>
 <p>I gave myself a bitter smile.&nbsp;<em>Gaoqin Jiuye, there’re things that you’re afraid of too?</em></p>
 <p><em>Are you afraid that he’ll die?</em></p>
 <p><em>What if I want him dead?</em></p>
 <p>As if shocked by the darkness in my heart, I opened my eyes wide and shook my head subconsciously.</p>
 <p><em>What was I thinking?</em></p>
 <p><em>Did I have to be controlled by this devil within me whenever it comes to Gaoqin Jiuye?!</em></p>
 <p>“Only me… why was Si Luo able to earn a place in your heart…” Tears flowed down Guan Nie’s cheeks. It was heart-breaking.</p>
 <p>“You were ostracized and left alone… but I loved that lonely look of yours… I really liked you at that time… doesn’t matter if you were just standing or sitting, it seemed as if no one could come near…”</p>
 <p>Guan Nie’s voice started trembling, “How I wished for you to be lonely forever… I wished no one else would walk into your heart… If I can’t do that, nobody else can do it either…</p>
 <p>“How I wish there would be no one by your side for all eternity… I wish for everyone to turn their back on you, leaving only me by your side…”</p>
 <p>Guan Nie’s voice became softer.</p>
 <p>My heart felt like it was shredded into a million pieces.</p>
 <p><em>Such a selfish and possessive love, wasn’t I like this before?</em></p>
 <p><em>I was ostracized and called a monster. They were right.&nbsp;</em><em>No matter how I justified my actions, I had to admit that I acted like this towards Gao Qi.</em></p>
 <p><em>Wishing that no one else remained by your side, so that there’ll only be me left.</em></p>
 <p>“Ka---!”</p>
 <p>A shrill and eerie laughter broke my train of thought, and as I turned back, I saw Rong Jin’s dark shadow pierce through Nie Zun’s heart!</p>
 <p>His dark shadow was long and thin, looking like a shadowy blade. As no one was paying attention to him, he took the opportunity to injure Nie Zun!</p>
 <p>“No!” I screamed, lifting my arm to strike with Piercer. Piercer produced a bright light, and my hand was actually restrained by this light!</p>
 <p>The pain shot up my arm and straight into my heart!</p>
 <p>Nie Zun looked calm, but his eyes were holding back pain. The light in his starry eyes seemed to darken.</p>
 <p>I could not move my arm!</p>
 <p>“Urgh---!” Guan Nie continued coughing mouthfuls of blood!</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Guan Nie’s condition, Gaoqin Jiuye seemed to go back to being enraged. He lifted his hand, and Shen Qi turned back into that long, thin sword in his hand!</p>
 <p>There was a horrific aura surrounding Shen Qi now, and one’s defenses naturally guarded against it. Once that hits you, your MF will be greatly damaged!</p>
 <p>Shen Qi was heading for the temporarily immobilized Nie Zun, who was impaled by that dark shadow!</p>
 <p>“Don’t---!” I screamed as my arm was not able to move even an inch. I looked at Gaoqin Jiuye, begging him with my eyes!</p>
 <p>I wondered if I was seeing things, but I thought that Gaoqin Jiuye slowed down for a second because of my cries! However, the cold glint that flashed past his eyes made me sure that he would not stop the attack!</p>
 <p>It was just a second away from peril!</p>
 <p><em>What should I do?! What do I do! I can’t move, I can’t move, my arm can’t move Piercer!</em></p>
 <p>“Shen’er…”</p>
 <p>A voice which did not belong to Nie Zun, but sounded like him, appeared in my head!</p>
 <p>Nie Zun’s eyes darkened, as if he had given up on dodging the attack. I reached toward my own neck with my other hand!</p>
 <p>I focused all my MF on that hand, and with lightning speed, I plucked out my splitting key, knelt down, and jammed it into my left ankle!</p>
 <p>Into that same scorpion symbol which Gaoqin Jiuye, no, which he and I shared!</p>
 <p>Clack.</p>
 <p>I heard a clear clicking sound.</p>
 <p>“Hai.”</p>
 <p>Something which sounded like a light sigh floated past my ear.</p>
 <p>It sounded familiar, yet helpless.</p>
 <p>It sounded sorrowful and lonely.</p>
 <p>Everything seemed to stop for a second. In this second, I was able to see Gaoqin Jiuye’s hand about to slash into Nie Zun, and Nie Zun’s eyes seemed to shine with a dazzling brightness!</p>
 <p>An uneasy feeling overwhelmed me from head to toe. This feeling… It was stronger than all the other times when I felt uneasy!</p>
 <p>It felt as if something deep within my soul was trying to break free, and even though I knew I was heading for an abyss, I dove in without hesitation.</p>
 <p>I could not tell if my soul was being torn apart or if my heart was being shattered. The monster within me could finally break free and roar, and I released it to destroy this world.</p>
 <p>I threw Piercer onto the ground, and Shen Qi stopped in the second before it touched Nie Zun. Rong Jin’s shadow stopped moving and Guan Nie looked at me with bated breath.</p>
 <p>All their eyes were on me.</p>
 <p>I cried out in what was possibly the most painful, sorrowful cry that anyone has ever heard in the Split Zone. Almost half of my MF was used up in this cry. It had a force that pierced through souls, making everyone quieten down.</p>
 <p>Even me.</p>
 <p>Because of that darkness which clawed its way through, I saw things clearly now.</p>
 <p><em>It was as if we were apart for a century, but you came back to me eventually.</em></p>
 <p>After I focused a high amount of MF on my throat, it felt hoarse after I let out that bloodcurdling scream. I fixed my eyes on someone in front of me.</p>
 <p>As I activated my split symbol, my body produced a streak of red light. This red was eerie but dazzling. It was bright, it was shiny, it was blinding.</p>
 <p>Not far from me, the red light materialized into someone. She had a gentle but ruthless smile on her, as if she could easily destroy the world in a second.</p>
 <p>Leaving no one alive.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she had a stunning smile. It was empty and cruel, and she was staring at me.</p>
 <p>She was dressed in red and she had red hair, looking exactly like me.</p>
 <p>She looked like she just returned from a bloody battle, and smiled at me with empty eyes.</p>
 <p>“Shen’er.”</p>
 <p>This was the voice of the siren in the sea.</p>
