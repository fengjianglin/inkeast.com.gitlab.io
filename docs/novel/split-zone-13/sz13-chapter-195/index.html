 <p>“If he’s really like how you describe him to be, then wouldn’t there be no one who can be his opponent in the Split Zone? Why do you dare to speak to him like that then?” I looked at Li Wen from the corner of my eye.</p>
 <p>Li Wen smiled. “That’s because I know he wouldn’t dare do anything to me no matter what I did.”</p>
 <p>I raised a brow. “Oh, really?”</p>
 <p>Li Wen seemed to look into the distance as she answered me. “If he dares hurt me, he can forget about seeing Li Qing ever again.”</p>
 <p><em>So something is really going on between Ghost King Huai Du and Li Qing. But using Li Qing as a bargaining tool was really low of her.</em></p>
 <p><em>Well, Li Wen is Li Qing’s soul splitter. If Huai Du did love Li Qing, then Li Wen would have nothing to fear. </em>I turned cold. “That’s right, you’re the best at threatening and attacking people with their weaknesses.”</p>
 <p>Li Wen knew that I was referring to how she used Jiao S to threaten me earlier, but she had no intention of arguing with me. She walked up to me and took my hand. “I know you must hate me now, but don’t forget who your real enemies are. Du Yue is the one who destroyed your Western District and hurt your friends. Since you’re the only one with what I am looking for, I’m not going to hurt anyone else as long as you work with me.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye responded with sarcasm, “Blaming everything on Du Yue? No matter what she does, at least she does it openly. But you? You do things sneakily.”</p>
 <p>Li Wen’s face turned pale for a moment.</p>
 <p>Though Gaoqin Jiuye was speaking up for Du Yue now, I was rather satisfied as I saw the look on Li Wen’s face.</p>
 <p>I realized that I’ve almost forgotten about someone.</p>
 <p>The ignored Ku Fei suddenly spoke. “Ah Shen, thank you for all your help. There’s nothing much for me here now that the Southern District has been destroyed, and Huan Qing and Mi Fu have both left.”</p>
 <p>My heart sank at this. I walked over and patted Ku Fei gently on the shoulder. “Don’t say that, Ku Fei. Gaoqin Jiuye is still here, Si Luo is still here. There’re still people from the Southern District who’re still alive. You can’t give up no matter what.”</p>
 <p>Ku Fei’s usually cheery face looked dispirited. It looked like he no longer carried any hope. “I’m not even qualified to give up on myself. I can’t leave the Split Zone if I can’t find my soul splitter, and I can’t even kill myself… I’m worried about Lord Si Luo too, but I can’t do anything for him…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye interrupted, “How do you know that if you haven’t tried? Rong Jin disappeared after a fight, and it’s only us few from the Southern District now. Among those who’ve survived, I’m afraid you’re the only heir. Are you still going to give up on yourself like this?”</p>
 <p><em>Right… Hearing Gaoqin Jiuye’s words, I was reminded that most heirs in the Southern District were rather weak. Even my residents weren’t able to survive this catastrophe, what more about those from the Southern District… If that’s the case, wouldn’t Ku Fei be the last surviving heir from the Southern District now?</em></p>
 <p>Ku Fei looked at Gaoqin Jiuye. ‘What can I do for you guys?”</p>
 <p>I didn’t know how Gaoqin Jiuye planned to answer this, but I had to cut him off no matter what. “There’s no need for you to do anything for us. You just need to follow us and find your soul splitter, undo the split symbol contract and leave the Split Zone.”</p>
 <p>I looked at him with determination.</p>
 <p>Li Wen suddenly laughed. “Gate of Heaven, Gate of Ghost, Gate of Exit. The size of each group is greater than any of you could imagine. Soul splitters aren’t as rare as an existence either. You just love wishing for things, Ah Shen. How would you help him find his soul splitter? As the last surviving heir from the Southern District, what he should do now is to run away and hide from Du Yue so he wouldn’t be controlled by her and end up living like an insect. He would be considered lucky if he can avoid her.”</p>
 <p>I smirked. I focused MF on my feet and charged towards Li Wen, giving her a hard slap.</p>
 <p>“You.” Li Wen was stunned as she didn’t expect this. She didn’t think I dared do something like this since I was weaker than her, and she also thought I didn’t care much for whatever happened in the world.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye and Ku Fei probably did not expect me to do such a thing either, since they were all stunned.</p>
 <p>I looked at Li Wen gently, caressing her face. I knew she wouldn’t avoid it.</p>
 <p>As expected, Li Wen did not avoid me. She looked at me with an intense gaze.</p>
 <p>I touched the part of her face where I had just slapped, saying softly, “Living like an insect? What right do you have to talk about others like that? Are you not living like an insect now? Though I still don’t know why you had to leave me time and again, I have a nagging feeling that whatever you do is simply to make up for what you weren’t able to obtain. Are you jealous of my place in Li Qing’s heart? Why are you doing all this? Aren’t you living like an insect yourself…”</p>
 <p>Sorrow flashed in Li Wen’s eyes. She took a deep breath. “That’s right, I’m jealous of you. Li Qing had already left the Western District with me, but you were still on her mind, and she thought about you all the time. Don’t all heirs live like insects here… The Split Zone is a world belonging to soul splitters…”</p>
 <p>She got more and more agitated as she spoke, and I could see tears in her eyes when she finished.</p>
 <p><em>Something felt wrong somewhere.</em></p>
 <p><em>Why did it sound like she wasn’t a soul splitter…</em></p>
 <p><em>But, it can’t be. Her split symbol was exactly identical to Li Qing’s.</em></p>
 <p>Li Wen seemed to realize that she had accidentally revealed something and averted her gaze. She continued after a moment. “Do whatever you want, it has nothing to do with me anyway. Don’t forget that you’ll have to work with me if you want to save Song Lu.”</p>
 <p>She retreated to a corner after that, not looking at us.</p>
 <p>Though I was filled with suspicion, settling Ku Fei was the more important task at hand. I looked at Gaoqin Jiuye, signaling for him to come up with a solution.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shrugged as if he could not do anything about this. <em>Please, isn’t Ku Fei someone from your Southern District?</em></p>
 <p>I sighed as I said to Ku Fei, “How about you come with us first, then we’ll see…”</p>
 <p>I thought of something important suddenly. <em>How could I have forgotten something as important as this?</em></p>
 <p>My gaze quivered as I turned to Gaoqin Jiuye. He noticed something different about me and walked up to grab my hand. “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“I… I left Jiao S alone with Du Yue…” I felt like crying now.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes darkened. “So…”</p>
 <p>“So… I thought we’d definitely make it back in three days, and although we still have time, I forgot that Jiao S used part of her MF to hide Si Luo… I’m afraid that Si Luo might be exposed like this…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye swung my hand away.</p>
 <p>I could see the anger rise in him. “Li Shen, Si Luo is in deep sleep now. Do you wish for his death by leaving them together with Du Yue and Ta Lai?”</p>
 <p>Li Wen furrowed her brows and turned to me, asking, “Why didn’t you tell me Si Luo is here too?”</p>
 <p>However, her eyes could not hide her real emotions.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you really didn’t know?” I asked mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Enough, Li Shen.” Gaoqin Jiuye cut me off angrily before turning to leave.</p>
 <p>“No need to rush over to me so quickly. I’ve brought Si Luo here.”</p>
 <p>We heard Du Yue’s voice somewhere near us. She walked towards us with steady steps in her knee-high boots.</p>
 <p>Du Yue was taller than the average woman, and she was carrying Si Luo in her arms at this moment. This scene looked like something out of the ordinary.</p>
 <p>She walked up beside Gaoqin Jiuye and threw Si Luo at him. “You can’t even take care of your own people.”</p>
 <p>I frowned. <em>Why did I feel uncomfortable when I heard this?</em></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye shot me a look as he caught Si Luo.</p>
 <p>I turned to Du Yue. “Where’s Jiao S?”</p>
 <p>If Si Luo was out, it meant that Jiao S had used up her MF. Du Yue smirked. “I’ve brought her to someplace good. Do you want to come have a look too?”</p>
 <p>My hands balled into fists. “What did you do to her?”</p>
 <p>Du Yue ignored me and turned to Li Wen. “There’s actually a tiny ant over here.”</p>
 <p>Li Wen brushed her hair and walked up to Du Yue. “It’s been a long time, Du Yue.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue scoffed. “Your blood has turned back.”</p>
 <p>Li Wen smiled. “Yes, my blood can no longer kill heirs now. I’m so upset about this. But thanks to the previous collaboration, most heirs are already dead now, and there’s no need for us to go against each other anymore, don’t you think?”</p>
 <p>I shivered. “You worked with her?” I pointed at Du Yue as I looked at Li Wen in surprise.</p>
 <p>Li Wen covered her mouth as she said, “Ah Shen you dumb dumb, you really think there’s some type of blood that can kill heirs? It’s just a poison, and it isn’t permanent. It’s the same with Song Lu.”</p>
 <p><em>What can I say.&nbsp;</em>I heard Du Yue behind me. “Heirs are heirs. They love to believe people who’re not worthy of their trust.”</p>
 <p>At this, there was a slight change in Li Wen’s expression.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye then laughed maliciously. “If being a soul splitter means I have to be cruel and ruthless like you, then I’d rather be an heir.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue probably did not expect for Gaoqin Jiuye to say this. She turned to him. “I helped you bring Si Luo back and I’ve given you all that you want, be it a peaceful life or Si Luo’s safety. What else are you unhappy about?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, what else can I be unhappy about?” Gaoqin Jiuye said in self-mockery.</p>
 <p>I looked around. Ku Fei was standing in a corner. He looked at Si Luo sometimes, but he was blanking out most of the time. Gaoqin Jiuye was looking at Du Yue. As for Li Wen, I couldn’t tell what was in her head at all.</p>
 <p>But I know one thing for sure. There wasn’t a single person I could trust here.</p>
