 <p><strong>134 You Love Him That Deeply?</strong></p>
 <p>“What’s there to think about? You hand Mi Fu over, I let Si Luo engrave a split symbol on her, and the problem’s solved,” Gaoqin Jiuye said with a sharp glance.</p>
 <p>Si Luo waved an elegant hand. “Li Shen, do you think that Jiao S and Huan Qing will be able to find new bodies of consciousness, or do you think you’re able to find another way to save me?”</p>
 <p>This question was unusual.</p>
 <p><em>How would I know other methods to save you? I don’t even know what’s going on with you soul splitters here in the Split Zone.</em></p>
 <p>I smiled casually. “Si Luo, I think the issue lies with whether you want to be saved by us, and not whether we can find a way to save you. If you wish for death, how can I save you? It’s just like what you said to me when you peeked into my heart, ‘No one can save him if he’s already dead in your heart’. There’s nothing we can do if you want death, but your loyal Gaoqin would end up pinning the blame on me. Wouldn’t I be so wronged then?”</p>
 <p>What I said seemed to cause both Jiao S and Gaoqin Jiuye to look towards Si Luo for an answer. Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes seemed to burn with a dim fire, as if he wanted Si Luo to deny it.</p>
 <p>Si Luo was silent for a moment, before breaking into a warm smile. “Li Qing really had good foresight.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve already said this,” I spoke calmly.</p>
 <p>“How about this. Let me speak with you in private, and you can make a decision after that.” Jiao S spoke abruptly, as if she finally found the courage to voice her opinion.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think of coming close to him.” Gaoqin Jiuye stepped forward, showing clearly that he will intervene if we even dare take half a step forward.</p>
 <p>Si Luo looked at him gently. “Gaoqin, let me speak with her.”</p>
 <p>“Si Luo, you…” Gaoqin Jiuye looked at Si Luo with a complex emotion in his eyes, and after a quick pause, he slowly retreated to where he was before.</p>
 <p><em>Haha, in this world, Si Luo was probably the only one who could get Gaoqin Jiuye to come to a compromise.</em></p>
 <p>Si Luo, who was originally lazing against the bed, suddenly flew towards Jiao S. His movement was so quick that I could only see a flurry of white go pass.</p>
 <p>I was stunned. <em>Was this the ability of the person with the highest MF in the Split Zone? Seems like he has recovered really well…</em></p>
 <p>His floating robes enshrouded him like a piece of painting, and his silver hair fell across his neck as he looked down, right in front of Jiao S. As he was only inches away from her, his long hair seemed to entangle with Jiao S’s black hair when he moved.</p>
 <p>It was obvious Jiao S did not expect him to do this, and I did not expect it either.</p>
 <p>Jiao S looked dumbfounded, and also a little surprised.</p>
 <p>Her emotionless face seemed to light up in an instant, as if she was suddenly alive. It was like a sleeping princess being awoken by a kiss from her prince.</p>
 <p>I kept looking at the both of them.</p>
 <p>Si Luo was really beautiful. No mortal could compare to such beauty, which also carried with it a hint of nobility.</p>
 <p>Although the dubious and emotionless Jiao S was not usually described as someone beautiful, she always had a unique aura about her. Her black hair framed those huge, black eyes of hers, and though she looked like a young girl, she had that domineering air when leading the S Clan, a kind of queenly aura.</p>
 <p>Right now, there was slight surprise and bashfulness on her emotionless face. This was an eye-opener for me. Yes, that was the word, eye-opener!</p>
 <p>The contrast between the two was great. Their auras were totally different, but this scene made it difficult for me to tear my eyes away from the both of them.</p>
 <p>I happened to catch a glimpse of Gaoqin Jiuye, and he had this dark, worried expression as he looked at the two of them.</p>
 <p>Si Luo kept his noble and gentle gaze on Jiao S, saying in his melodic voice, “You’re still the same as last time.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p><em>That’s weird having to hear him say this to her!</em></p>
 <p>Joy blossomed in me. This proves that Si Luo had been thinking of her.</p>
 <p>My heart softened. I believe that Jiao S would feel happy at this, after having suppressed that loneliness for so long. I was really happy for her.</p>
 <p>To prevent anyone else from being the gooseberry, I walked over to Gaoqin Jiuye and grabbed his hand. “Let’s go. Since your District Commander has spoken, why not we give them some time to themselves? You don’t actually think that Jiao S would actually hurt him, do you?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was visibly shocked at my sudden actions, and he seemed to be momentarily frozen. I made use of this instant to pull him out of the room.</p>
 <p>“We’ll wait in the room beside.” After speaking, I dragged Gaoqin Jiuye out, and closed the door after me as we entered the adjacent room.</p>
 <p>Behind me, I heard Gaoqin Jiuye scoff. “So much effort to spend alone time with me? What, are you going to mistake me for Gao Qi again?”</p>
 <p>I turned back and stared at him. “Gaoqin Jiuye, I don’t understand what’s up with your current attitude towards me. If I remember right, you pretended not to know me the very first time we met. Fine, that I understand if you might not want me to go any closer and realize you were a soul splitter. But why weren’t you cold all the time? I’m not blind, so don’t pretend. There was a time when you treated me like a friend, so why are you so against that?”</p>
 <p>“Huh, friend? I never have friends.” It was as if he just heard a joke, his eyes full of self-mockery.</p>
 <p>I kept my eyes on him. “Si Luo used a technique on me, I don’t know what, but it backfired on him and I was able to witness the scene where the both of you met.”</p>
 <p>I saw Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes tremble. “What did you say?”</p>
 <p>I held his gaze. “It’s true. It was probably this that caused his condition to worsen at the time, and you appeared after he passed out. In his dream, I seemed to have seen the younger you beside a small river, and it looked like your first meeting with him…”</p>
 <p>Before I could finish, Gaoqin Jiuye pushed me back against the door with his hands!</p>
 <p>Boom! He was not gentle about it!</p>
 <p>His eyes were on fire and it felt dangerous. He pressed on my shoulders with greater force as he asked, “What else did you see, huh? Li Shen?”</p>
 <p>I was perturbed by this sudden outburst, but I regained my composure quickly. After calming myself down, I looked at him squarely, “What you afraid of me seeing? That you were originally also a lonely person who was ostracized? That you were cowardly and full of self-loathing when you were younger?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye did not get angry like I thought he would. Instead, he simply let out a sigh. “So you only saw me at that age.”</p>
 <p><em>I don’t understand. Apart from those memories from your younger days, what else were you afraid of me seeing?</em></p>
 <p>I tried to pry. “There was actually another person around…”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye turned anxious again. “Was it a he or a she?”</p>
 <p><em>What?</em></p>
 <p>The suspicion in me grew. <em>Just who was he talking about? Seems like I knew these people as well? Wait, a girl… Yes, wasn’t he always a little weird with that Du Yue?</em></p>
 <p>I looked away as I answered as surely as I could, “Du Yue.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was stunned at first, but said, “That’s not possible.”</p>
 <p>He looked pained. “How could you have seen her in Si Luo’s heart. Are you trying to test me? Li Shen, I suggest you tell the truth.”</p>
 <p>As he said this, his head moved closer to my face. He still looked cold, but in the moment when he approached me, I thought I saw a hint of gentleness there.</p>
 <p>Upon a second look, he still looked cold. When has Gaoqin Jiuye ever been warm.</p>
 <p>I have never seen any warmth in his expressions, there was only complex emotions, pain and sadness even when others talk about Du Yue, who seemed to have a great influence on him, or about Guan Nie, who gave so much for him.</p>
 <p>It was only when he faced Si Luo would there be any trace of warmth.</p>
 <p>For some reason I was rather irritated, and I looked at him coldly. “Why should I tell you? What are you afraid of? You don’t have to worry, I’m not interested in your life at all. Your past, who you’ve met, I don’t care.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked rather stunned, and his eyes seemed lit with firelight. “You really don’t care about my past, who I’ve met, and everything else about me? Even if I might have some connection to the lover you killed?”</p>
 <p>His hands were still on my shoulders, and his face was about to touch mine.</p>
 <p>My heart ached immediately.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” I stared at him with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>His lips were right in front of my nose, as if it could come into contact with my nose anytime. He smiled sarcastically. “What, finally interested in me now? Because of him? You love him so much that you’ll continue loving him even after you’ve killed him? You still love him after you killed him? You still love him even after he’s dead?”</p>
 <p>He asked all this at one go. I was not seeing things this time, I was sure there was some wildness and passion in his voice and in his gaze.</p>
 <p>For some reason, I did not really dare to answer ‘Yes, I just love him’. I thus avoided his eyes and his questions.</p>
 <p>He grabbed my chin with a hand, forcing me to look at him.</p>
 <p>“Say it, Li Shen. You love him that deeply? Why is that so?”</p>
