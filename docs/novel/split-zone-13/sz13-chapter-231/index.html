 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>231 Fighting over Piercer</strong></p>
 <p>Nie Zun spoke with no emotion. “There’s no use in you throwing a tantrum here.”</p>
 <p>Putting his hands back into his pockets, he walked away towards one of the water vats.</p>
 <p>I pulled on his sleeve. “What do you mean by throwing a tantrum? Return Piercer to me if you’re going to leave.”</p>
 <p>Actually, it did look like I was throwing a tantrum here. But I didn’t care about that. All I knew was that I didn’t want him to disappear right in front of me.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun looked at my hand that was on his sleeve. “Piercer is no longer with me. You should be looking elsewhere.”</p>
 <p>I said stubbornly, “You threw it at Cang Ming. I want you to get it back for me.”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun furrowed his brows.</p>
 <p>Just when I thought Nie Zun was about to say something to hurt me yet again, Gaoqin Jiuye rushed over and took me into an embrace.</p>
 <p>There was a fire in his eyes and he was so quick that I didn’t have enough time to react.</p>
 <p>A kiss landed on my lips.</p>
 <p>This was the first time Gaoqin Jiuye put his lips against mine.</p>
 <p>I was absolutely stunned.</p>
 <p>He retreated just as quickly. Looking at me with fiery passion, he said, “Let him go. I can help you get Piercer back. Leave everything to me in future.”</p>
 <p>His words seemed to explode right beside my ears.</p>
 <p>It was lucky that I was no longer that childish Li Shen, the one who would be bedazzled after a single kiss.</p>
 <p>As I tried to calm myself, I stole a glance at Nie Zun, noticing that he had stopped in his tracks. He seemed to be taking note of Gaoqin Jiuye and me.</p>
 <p>I looked at Gaoqin Jiuye again. Though his eyes were bright and clear, something seemed to be amiss.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye was audacious, but he wasn’t someone who acted on impulse. Even though he had confessed to me before, there was no need for him to do this.</p>
 <p><em>Was he doing this to confirm if Nie Zun still had feelings for me?</em></p>
 <p><em>Was he such a kind individual?</em></p>
 <p>I felt Gaoqin Jiuye’s lips touch mine again.</p>
 <p>There was a wet softness to it as his tongue explored my lips.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t accept this kiss even if he was really trying to help me.</p>
 <p>I stole another glance at Nie Zun before deciding if I wanted to avoid this.</p>
 <p>Just when I could almost make out Nie Zun’s expression, something else distracted me.</p>
 <p>The source of that distraction came from countless images flashing past my mind. Coupled with those images were feelings of being helpless and terrified.</p>
 <p>I could not focus on Nie Zun’s expression at this point. All I could do was to look into Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes which were right in front of me.</p>
 <p>White fog surged in them and it looked just like he was controlling the air currents around him.</p>
 <p>Before I could react, I heard a voice in my head.</p>
 <p>“Ah Shen, you have to stab me with this knife if I turn into a devil and lose control someday.”</p>
 <p>“Ah Shen, I’m giving you this knife. Keep it with you at all times. I’ll be waiting for the day when you finally end this.”</p>
 <p>“I love you, Ah Shen, even if you might find out that I’m not me someday. You aren’t who you thought you were either. Please remember that I, Gao Qi, really loved you.”</p>
 <p>My lips quivered as thousands of voices seemed to appear in my head. Gaoqin Jiuye hugged me harder, and just as my lips were about to be pried open, Nie Zun pulled the two of us apart.</p>
 <p>There was a dark killing intent in his eyes. He stood between us as he said in a low voice, “Don’t even think of using whatever I’ve used a second time.”</p>
 <p>He stared at Gaoqin Jiuye sharply.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye kept his eyes on me. He looked a little exhausted as he spoke. “I don’t care about that. I’m going to take whatever you don’t want. What can you do about it?”</p>
 <p>He shot a sharp look at Nie Zun.</p>
 <p>Sizzle.</p>
 <p>Two blades of air pushed Nie Zun’s hands away, forcing Nie Zun to step backwards.</p>
 <p>I retreated a couple of steps as well.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me with furrowed brows, as if asking why I stepped back.</p>
 <p>None of them knew that I didn’t feel like talking right now, because all my energy was focused on Gao Qi’s words that I had just heard. <em>What did that mean?</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t even flinch at those hurtful words Nie Zun said as I was too preoccupied with piecing together what I could find in my memories.</p>
 <p>In those images, Gao Qi took me in an embrace on the balcony as I felt his lips meet mine with sorrow. His voice seemed to stab right through to my heart as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Ah Shen, you’ll have to kill me if I turn into a devil someday. You have to kill me in exchange for your freedom. You should never go there.”</p>
 <p>As I recalled his words, I looked at Gaoqin Jiuye and asked, “What did Gao Qi know? Just how are the both of you related to each other?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes seemed to shine. “What do you remember?”</p>
 <p>I answered immediately, “Are you afraid that I’ll remember?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve already explained this to you, haven’t I? I’m the one you loved, not Gao Qi. Gao Qi had fallen in love with you as well, and to protect you, he was ready to give everything up.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean he was ready to give everything up?”</p>
 <p>“It’s…” Cang Ming swung Piercer suddenly before Gaoqin Jiuye could finish.</p>
 <p>Crack.</p>
 <p>Violet sparks appeared and a violet blade flew towards me.</p>
 <p>I’ve never thought that my own weapon would end up attacking me someday.</p>
 <p>I raised Scorpion Ray on my left hand.</p>
 <p>My brain was on overdrive now. <em>Why did Cang Ming attack? Was it some secret that he didn’t want me to know? Is this why Cang Ming decided to interfere?</em></p>
 <p>But before I could even ask further questions, I had to win this.</p>
 <p>“Scorpion Ray!” I called out. Light condensed in front of me to form a screen.</p>
 <p>It shattered like glass upon contact with the violet blade. With that, the power of the violet blade was reduced as well.</p>
 <p>In the smoke and dust, I heard air currents whirling around me. <em>Had Gaoqin Jiuye been controlling the air currents all this while?</em></p>
 <p><em>Does this mean that both Scorpion Ray’s and Piercer’s attacks would be affected?</em></p>
 <p>I could see streaks of black amidst the white fog that appeared. The streaks looked like strands of hair floating in the wind.</p>
 <p>Looking towards Nie Zun, I realized one of his hands was already outside of his pockets, looking like it was simply resting by his side.</p>
 <p>I backed away in the chaos.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t understand any of them. Though it seemed like I might have the key to breaking this gridlock, I was actually entrapped in it myself.</p>
 <p>“I guess there are some things you don’t wish for me to know.” I smirked at Cang Ming as I said so. <em>Why else did he attack so suddenly if it wasn’t to prevent Gaoqin Jiuye from speaking?</em></p>
 <p>Piercer was glowing with a violet light as Cang Ming held it in his hand. I stared at Piercer as I focused MF on my thoughts, <em>Come back to me if you don’t want to be used by them. I can help you find Zou An.</em></p>
 <p>I didn’t know if this would work, but I had to try whatever I could think of. Unexpectedly, Piercer seemed to be able to sense my thoughts.</p>
 <p>Piercer glowed brightly and Cang Ming’s eyes darkened as he was forced to let go of it.</p>
 <p><em>Now’s the time.</em></p>
 <p>Stretching out my left hand, I created something resembling a whirlpool with my palm. Piercer flew towards it, looking like a purple snake that was flying through the air.</p>
 <p>Just as it was about to reach me, a dark mist wrapped itself around Piercer like a pair of gigantic hands.</p>
 <p>I reached out in haste to grab Piercer’s end.</p>
 <p>A numbing pain shot through my palm all the way to my heart. The drug applied to Piercer was no ordinary one, and it jolted me wide awake as I saw the blood seep out from my palm.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun was pulling on Piercer at the other end with his hand that was enshrouded in black mist.</p>
 <p>I focused MF onto my hand as I pulled Piercer hard towards me.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun was also pulling hard on the other end as we engaged in a fierce tug-of-war with Piercer being pulled taught in the middle.</p>
