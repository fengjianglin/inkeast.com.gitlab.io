 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>227 Don’t Underestimate Me</strong></p>
 <p>“No… It’s not like this…” Images flashed past my mind as I recalled what Bian Ying told me earlier.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t wrap my head around this. All of it just happened too suddenly.</p>
 <p>Bian Ying told me that it was impossible for us to be captured and brought to the Split Zone, and in order to save her, Cang Ming and Ta Lai both had to share the same split symbol with her.</p>
 <p>She also told me that although Gaoqin Jiuye wasn’t like Cang Ming, who was born with great MF, he wasn’t weak either. Logically speaking, there was no need for him to establish a split symbol contract with me and restrict himself like this.</p>
 <p><em>So, why did he do something like that?</em></p>
 <p><em>Was he telling the truth? That he did it to save me from Gao Qi?</em></p>
 <p>I don’t remember what happened from before, and I wasn’t able to piece together a full picture from those fragments that appeared in my mind.</p>
 <p><em>Was there something else going on here?</em></p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me.</p>
 <p>I met his eyes. “Bian Ying told me that others had to make a sacrifice if people like us wanted to survive in the Split Zone. I didn’t know what she was talking about at that time, but is this what you’ve been talking about?”</p>
 <p>“Also, before you tell me that, can you tell me why you’re here?” I asked.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye placed his hands back into his pockets. “Du Yue was in a rage after you left, and I don’t know where Li Wen went after that. Initially, Du Yue’s plan was to look for you first, but she scrapped that after hearing news about Ta Lai and went to look for him instead.”</p>
 <p>“So you came here after they left? Isn’t this a little too contrived? You don’t know I’m in the demon cave.” I stared at him.</p>
 <p>He shrugged as he answered, “I didn’t know you were here. And actually, I didn’t come here to look for you.”</p>
 <p><em>Oh, you weren’t looking for me?</em></p>
 <p>“He’s here to look for me.”</p>
 <p>I turned in surprise as I heard another voice from within the stone room.</p>
 <p>I didn’t realize that there was actually someone else in this place. <em>Wait, no, he wasn’t here from before. Where did he come from?</em></p>
 <p>Somewhere behind us, an evil-looking man wearing a blood-red robe was resting on the ground. He rested his head on a hand, propping himself up with an elbow as he rested against his side while he looked at us.</p>
 <p>“Cang Ming…” I muttered subconsciously.</p>
 <p>Cang Ming ignored me as he continued speaking to Gaoqin Jiuye, “You’re becoming less and less like yourself. You’re going to lose this woman if you continue being indecisive like this.”</p>
 <p>He pointed a finger at me, regarding me with what felt like a mocking gaze.</p>
 <p><em>What an audacious individual.</em></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s expression instantly returned to that cold arrogance as he spoke to Cang Ming. “I’ve already lost her. I just hope for her to have a happy life. I’m not going to follow your example in locking somebody up.”</p>
 <p>I sucked in a breath. This was obviously referring to how he forcefully kept Bian Ying by his side.</p>
 <p>Cang Ming was rather strange. He didn’t get angry when I thought he would. He simply smiled and answered in a conversational tone, “You’re right in not choosing to follow my example.”</p>
 <p><em>Is he really that audacious Cang Ming from before?</em></p>
 <p>“Hey, woman. I heard that you’re just like my woman, that you have a second personality here in the Split Zone.” Cang Ming posed me a question that I did not know how to answer.</p>
 <p><em>Woman. I heard that you’re just like my woman.</em></p>
 <p>So much must have went on between them.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Why, are you interested in my second personality too?” I raised my brows in mock curiosity.</p>
 <p>The corners of Cang Ming’s eyes turned up slightly. “Too? Who else is interested?”</p>
 <p>I pondered for a moment. <em>Should I tell him the truth?</em></p>
 <p><em>Should I tell him that your Bian Ying might be able to find that lost consciousness of hers? By taking over the empty shell of my soul?</em></p>
 <p><em>Should I tell him that this is Ta Lai’s goal?</em></p>
 <p>I couldn’t decide on this right away. I stole a glance at Gaoqin Jiuye.</p>
 <p>He was silent and he did not look like he wanted to be a part of this conversation at all.</p>
 <p><em>I guess I’ll just have to depend on myself for this.</em></p>
 <p>“Ta Lai has been chasing after me to find out more about this, probably. And possibly, also to find out why Bian Ying had a change of heart.” I smiled at Cang Ming as I answered.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye interrupted me. “You think she’d know? She’s just like the Bian Ying of the past. She’s simply being kept in the dark and being used as a tool. You’re better off asking me.”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming laughed, waving a hand. “There’s no need to play such games with me, Gaoqin Jiuye. I know you well enough. No one can get information out of you unless you’re willing to provide it.”</p>
 <p>I frowned at this. I knew he was referring to the fact that Gaoqin Jiuye was a sly fox, but this felt like an indirect attack on my intelligence.</p>
 <p><em>Trying to get information from me when he knows it’s impossible to get it from Gaoqin Jiuye? Am I that dumb?</em></p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes squinted in a smile. “Let’s not talk about all this. Where’s your Bian Ying now?”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming’s smiled seemed to freeze at this.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye noticed it immediately, and his smile faded gradually. “Don’t tell me that you’ve lost her. It doesn’t look like something you’d do, that she isn’t here with you now.”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming got up slowly, resting his elbows on his knees as he sat up. “Her condition is getting from bad to worse these days. Is it you or Du Yue who did something to her? Or does this involve Piercer somehow?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye furrowed his brows slightly. “Her condition is getting from bad to worse? Do you mean that there are signs of possible death?”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming nodded. “There are similar symptoms.”</p>
 <p>“So this is why you’re here. It’s not merely for Du Yue, is it?” Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes had a cold glaze to them.</p>
 <p>A mirthless smile appeared on Cang Ming. “There’s no need for me to explain anymore since you can already tell. Gaoqin Jiuye, I’ll be frank with you. Bian Ying sunk into soul coma when I took her away from Du Yue the other day. Her condition isn’t improving even though she regained consciousness after I woke her up. I’m disinclined to believe that this was Du Yue’s doing, since Ta Lai was there as well, and he wouldn’t let her do such a thing. But I’m not a hundred percent sure about that.”</p>
 <p>“So, what of it?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care what Du Yue is plotting, but I’ve heard an interesting story.” Cang Ming laughed wickedly and seemed to steal a glance in my direction.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye raised a brow as he asked, “What is it?”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming pointed at me as he replied, “I heard that her second personality can become a vessel for Bian Ying’s consciousness. Ta Lai is going about this right now. If he succeeds, Bian Ying’s life will no longer be in danger. Is that true?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye glanced at me. “What do you think? Ta Lai is obsessed with saving Bian Ying, and the one thing he wants to see is for Bian Ying to leave you. You believe Ta Lai just because it’s true that Li Shen has a second personality? You think you can whitewash Li Shen’s second personality to the point that it can turn into a vessel for Bian Ying’s consciousness? Firstly, you should know that this isn’t something Bian Ying would be willing to do. Secondly, what do you plan to do if it doesn’t work?”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming stood up. “But she has Piercer with her, and Piercer will recognize her as its owner. Is this all mere coincidence? Gaoqin Jiuye, you’d better pray that all this has nothing to do with her. If not, I’m definitely taking her life.”</p>
 <p><em>Definitely taking my life?</em></p>
 <p><em>Hahahahaha.</em></p>
 <p><em>Seems like I’ve been way too nice.</em></p>
 <p>“Taking my life? Aren’t you taking another person’s life too lightly like this?” I smirked.</p>
 <p>Cang Ming turned to me with disdain in his eyes. “I don’t know if taking your life would be an easy task, but I like efficient and effective solutions. If I remember right, that person whose face I helped to heal, you have feelings for him, right? Do you think I’d let him go easily if you refuse to listen to me?”</p>
 <p>I was incensed at this.</p>
 <p>I hate it when others use Nie Zun to threaten me, especially when Nie Zun has changed so much that even I was not able to understand him fully. Someone had the gall to use him to threaten me at a time like this?</p>
 <p>I smiled cruelly. “I’m sorry, but firstly, I don’t think you’d be able to do anything to Nie Zun. Secondly, I’d like to tell you that Bian Ying’s opinions run contrary to yours. If you continue like this, you’ll lose Bian Ying someday. You think that you have extraordinary abilities, but the fact is, even if everything goes according to your plan, you won’t be able to save her without my second personality. Do you think you should be talking to me like that?”</p>
 <p>Cang Ming finally seemed to take a slight interest in me. “Are you admitting that your second personality can save her?”</p>
 <p>I smirked. “There’s a possibility, but I’m not sure of it. No matter what my second personality can do or whether she can really help you, I’d advise you guys to give up. Do you really think you’re able to control me just because you have greater MF? Even I’m not able to control that personality of mine.”</p>
 <p>I spoke slowly now. “Don’t underestimate me, Cang Ming.”</p>
