 <p>Volume 4</p>
 <p><strong>250 One Against Five</strong></p>
 <p>Du Yue’s smile looked like she had anticipated everything. “Since you’re here, you must have that bottle with you then. Ah Shen’s friend, Jiao S, is still waiting for her eyes. You can return it to them.”</p>
 <p><em>Du Yue called me Ah Shen…</em></p>
 <p>My hairs stood on ends.</p>
 <p>A bottle magically appeared in Gaoqin Jiuye hands before he put it on one of the desks near him. “You know this isn’t the only reason I’m here. I knew that the opening had been activated when I saw this bottle in front of me. What did you do to her? You made her remember?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye pointed a finger at me with a cold look on his face.</p>
 <p>Though he was usually arrogant, he looked indifferent most of the time. This was the first time I saw a serious expression on him.</p>
 <p>However, he had not taken a single look at me since he entered. For some reason, it felt as if he was afraid to do so.</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked. “That’s right, that opening which I had created earlier had now been activated. She knows everything now.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye looked at me with bright eyes.</p>
 <p>Du Yue glanced back and forth between me and Gaoqin Jiuye. “She already knows that her senior Gao Qi wasn’t the one she had fallen in love with when she was alive. She knows that it was you who passed through the dimensions and who took over Gao Qi’s body.”</p>
 <p>I subconsciously looked at Nie Zun as she said this. Except for a slight movement in his hands, Nie Zun was completely still.</p>
 <p>I bit my lip.</p>
 <p>No matter what Du Yue’s plan was, I won’t let her get her way. That smug look of hers annoyed me so much. I spoke, “No, I didn’t recall everything. I only recalled the part when we first met. I’m not sure about whatever happened after.”</p>
 <p>I addressed this to Gaoqin Jiuye, thinking that he would clarify things. Instead, he looked at me and said, “You could only remember a tiny part even when you had the chance to recall everything? Looks like you’re still not ready to face yourself, and also to face me.”</p>
 <p>I stole a glance at Nie Zun again.</p>
 <p>Du Yue laughed out loud. “Don’t forget, Gaoqin Jiuye, you’re not the one she loves now. Why would she still be interested in those lost memories when she doesn’t love you anymore? I’ve told you that she’s not worth it. How much did you get in return for how much you’ve given up for her?”</p>
 <p>In response, Gaoqin Jiuye said, “Return? All I wanted was for her to be safe. It’s the same right now. That ring is gone now, and we are unable to find it no matter how hard we look. Don’t think that I’m unaware of your plans. You won’t be able to complete it without power. Now that you’re not able to find that ring, you’re trying to activate her second personality and use it to go against Huai Du at the same time, right?”</p>
 <p>Fed up with their conversation, I interrupted them. “Where’s Yu Liang? Aren’t you trying to save Si Luo, Gaoqin Jiuye? How long do you want Si Luo to be unconscious for? Du Yue said she’d bring me to see Yu Liang. Si Luo would be able to wake up with Yu Liang around. Aren’t you going to ask where Yu Liang is?”</p>
 <p>I looked at Du Yue as I said this.</p>
 <p>Song Lu’s gaze landed on Du Yue as well.</p>
 <p>Du Yue’s chances of winning would drop if I turned this into an argument that was five against one. She might even lose it.</p>
 <p>Du Yue was no fool though. Her eyes shone as she said, “You want to save Si Luo? Sure. But I want that second personality of hers. I’ll never give up on this. How about you, Gaoqin Jiuye? Don’t you want to see her again?”</p>
 <p>This angered me.</p>
 <p><em>Her? </em>She spoke as if that ‘her’ was the one Gaoqin Jiuye wanted to meet, as if she had so much value.</p>
 <p>Before I came up with my retort, I wanted to see how Gaoqin Jiuye would respond. Little did I expect for him to turn to me and say, “The truth is right here. Since you’ve already recalled some things, how about you try and remember everything else.”</p>
 <p><em>Why did he say that?</em></p>
 <p>Nie Zun laughed suddenly, breaking the suffocating atmosphere in this laboratory with that laughter made it sound like nothing in this world affected him at all.</p>
 <p>His gaze remained cold and distant. “All this is for naught. Do you think that you’ll really be able to control her even if she had regained all her memories in an instant? If that was the case, Huai Du wouldn’t have had laid eyes on me.”</p>
 <p><em>What?</em></p>
 <p><em>Huai Du did something to him?</em></p>
 <p>All of us stood stock-still after we heard Nie Zun reveal this.</p>
 <p>Nie Zun then explained with patience, “All those possibilities you’ve thought of, especially you, Du Yue, Huai Du would be able to think of them too. He had already put in place his defenses, and he put a curse on me in that demon cave. Well, instead of a curse, it would be more accurate to call it a key that would activate upon certain circumstances.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, once Li Shen’s second personality is being activated, she’d be in a constant state of rage. Without me, it’s unlikely that anyone else would be able to stop her in that state.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue seemed to hesitate before she responded, “Are you sure this is not you just thinking too highly of yourself?”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun laughed with malice. “Thinking too highly of myself? You should know very well whether I have the ability.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue frowned. “That doesn’t sound like you at all. What did Huai Du do to you?”</p>
 <p>Nie Zun smiled casually. “He merely gave me some memories for me to understand some of the secrets in the Split Zone. Why? Are you scared that I know everything? All that planning, even that excuse of taking revenge on a rival in love? You’re afraid now?”</p>
 <p>His words were an obvious challenge.</p>
 <p>Though Du Yue looked calm, I could see her pupils shaking. Nie Zun had touched a nerve.</p>
 <p>However, I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about.</p>
 <p>“What are you guys planning to do?” I had to interrupt these people before the situation got out of hand.</p>
 <p>What I had to find out was if I could regain all my memories, and what exactly happened in those lost memories of mine.</p>
 <p>Du Yue ignored me. Everyone else ignored me.</p>
 <p>She looked at Gaoqin Jiuye. “Yu Liang is right outside. You’ll be able to see him when you exit through the door.”</p>
 <p>I thought I saw Song Lu shiver slightly at this.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye narrowed his eyes. “Du Yue, you’re trying to trick me now? I believe you if you tell me that I have to exit the door to be able to see him, since you’re good at connecting these spaces. But how can I be sure that you won’t do anything to Li Shen after I’m gone?”</p>
 <p>For some reason, his words sent a rush of warmth to my heart.</p>
 <p>Du Yue seemed a little surprised at what he said. She stared at him with gritted teeth as she responded. “You can forget about Si Luo waking up if you don’t go look for Yu Liang. That’s right, I’ll be doing something to your little lover once you’re gone. I want her to regain every single one of those lost memories. You don’t want that? No matter how much you like her, you’d not give up on Si Luo if you’re presented with a choice like this.”</p>
 <p>My heart was about to sink, but Gaoqin Jiuye said, “It’s not the same today. I don’t want her to remember so much. I’m sorry, but you’re running out of chips today. I can think of another way to save Si Luo in future, but don’t even dream of getting me to leave right now.”</p>
 <p><em>Is this the first time he had chosen me over Si Luo?</em></p>
 <p><em>But why did I not feel happy about this at all?</em></p>
 <p>Du Yue laughed in self-mockery. “I guess you’re really loyal to her. But can you see that you’re not the one in her eyes right now? Guess who she’d choose between you and her current lover?”</p>
 <p>I thought those words wouldn’t have affected anyone, because it was said with the purpose of tearing people apart. But Gaoqin Jiuye seemed to be affected by them as he looked at me with sorrowful eyes.</p>
 <p>That sorrow seemed to be able to pierce right through my heart.</p>
 <p>It was different now, since I remembered some things from the past.</p>
 <p>Memories are such amazing things. You won’t feel it if you don’t remember it, but you’ll never be able to ignore it if you recalled it.</p>
 <p>I had fallen in love with him once. He wasn’t Gao Qi, and he didn’t die. My heart hurt so much that I had to furrow my brows in pain.</p>
 <p>I caught Nie Zun from the side of my eye and I turned to look at him.</p>
 <p>He still had that indifferent gaze, as if he did not have a care in the world, as if nothing had happened. But I stared into his eyes and I knew I wasn’t seeing things. I could see that loneliness deep inside them.</p>
 <p>It was heart-wrenching.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to look for Yu Liang.” Song Lu spoke, breaking the silence.</p>
 <p>Du Yue frowned. “I know you’re not happy that I kept you in the dark about this. But I have a reason for doing so. Trust me, please. I’ll bring you to him when the time comes.”</p>
 <p><em>Haha, Du Yue could actually be polite like this? Trust me, please?</em></p>
 <p><em>Song Lu must have some sort of extraordinary ability to the point that she was being so favored by Du Yue.</em></p>
 <p>Song Lu did not buy it this time. She sounded resolute. “I don’t want to repeat this a third time. I want to look for him now. Open the door.”</p>
 <p>Du Yue narrowed her eyes as she relaxed her frown. “What to do? I don’t like how the situation has turned out now. This makes me want to break the peace that has been maintained up until now.”</p>
 <p><em>She wants to fight.</em></p>
 <p>That was quite fearless of her. <em>Do you really think you can win if it’s one against five?</em></p>
