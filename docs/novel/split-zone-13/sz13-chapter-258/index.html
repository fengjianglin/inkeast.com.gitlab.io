 <p>Volume 5</p>
 <p><strong>258 Boy and Girl</strong></p>
 <p>The two soul splitters who had their split symbol contracts undone didn’t look any different. However, according to Si Luo’s predictions, their conditions would start deteriorating quickly without a new heir since they had low MF.</p>
 <p>The ropes on them loosened with a quick movement of Du Yue’s fingers.</p>
 <p>The boy stood up and dusted himself.</p>
 <p>When I wasn’t paying attention, the boy turned quickly as he focused all his MF and used it to attack the woman’s exposed split symbol.</p>
 <p>The woman in the black stockings screamed with wide eyes, “What are you doing!”</p>
 <p>But her screams were drowned by the sound of her body shattering into a million pieces.</p>
 <p>The boy had used up all his strength and he was aging rapidly now. It was just like what happened to Huan Qing when we got him out of that glacier in the demon cave.</p>
 <p>The boy was panting continuously.</p>
 <p>I walked over to him slowly as I looked at that rapidly aging face. “You. You…”</p>
 <p>Surprise turned into a smirk on Du Yue’s face. “Focusing all your MF to attack someone on their split symbol when they’re at their weakest to crumble their consciousness? What a barbaric method. But you’re so weak that the effects backfired on you too huh?”</p>
 <p>I shot a sharp look at Du Yue, but the boy grabbed my hand.</p>
 <p>“I, I know you. You’re a good person. I’ve had enough of being a soul splitter. Your, your world is great. You want to go back. You didn’t let me down. All the insults from before, I’ve taken my revenge on my own. I’m going now. I’m not going to drag you with me. You have to leave this place. Everyone here is a demon.” His body then started to break into pieces.</p>
 <p>Du Yue smirked coldly and started to make her way away from here, as if such a scene would mar her eyes. Before leaving, she said, “Come to the Palace of Cold Blood to look for me after this is done.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Du Yue leave, the boy left a key in my hands. “Keep this… you…” He shattered into a million pieces of light before he could finish.</p>
 <p>I looked down at the key in my hand. It was golden and it looked tinier than a splitting key. I didn’t know what it did, but I tucked it safely with me.</p>
 <p>I had gotten a new dress, and Piercer was back in my hands, but there were less people around me. <em>No, I should be saying that there was no one left beside me now.</em></p>
 <p>Jiao S was with Si Luo all the time.</p>
 <p>I saw Si Luo as I was making my way back to the Palace of Cold Blood. Jiao S was not by his side.</p>
 <p>“You have something to say to me in private?” I looked around for a place to sit, but there didn’t seem to be any benches in sight. We might just have to stand like this.</p>
 <p>I’ve been getting lazy these days. I didn’t want to stand, nor did I want to do anything else.</p>
 <p>I seemed to have returned to those days when Li Qing went missing and I just took on the role of the Western District Commander. During that time, all I did was stay indoors or practice the bow and nothing else.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing actually. I just wanted to tell you more about Gaoqin.”</p>
 <p>Mentioning Gaoqin Jiuye, I was reminded of that slap he gave me.</p>
 <p>I looked away in slight frustration. “What is it?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo grabbed my hand and placed it against his chest.</p>
 <p>This took me by surprise. I looked up at those beautiful silvery eyes of his and couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.</p>
 <p>It seemed unreal when a beautiful person locked eyes with you like this. Since the beginning of time, humans had always been weak against beautiful things.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Shh…” His lips moved.</p>
 <p>I then realized that a scene had begun playing in front of me, as if I was watching some sort of video.</p>
 <p>It was a waterfall.</p>
 <p>A bright-eyed youth and a young girl with emotionless eyes were trying to control the water at the waterfall.</p>
 <p>Both of them were trying to change the speed of the water with MF, but it was too difficult for either of them.</p>
 <p>The water splashed onto them, wetting their faces, their hair and their clothes.</p>
 <p>The both of them were panting after a while. The boy stared at the girl angrily before he grabbed the air with a fist.</p>
 <p>He held a circular ball of water in his hand and threw it towards the girl.</p>
 <p>The girl’s soulless eyes turned bright suddenly. Making a cross with her hands, two pillars of water shot towards the boy.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the boy clapped his hands and a pillar of water emerged from the waterfall.</p>
 <p>“I’m asking the both of you to work together to change the direction of the flow of water. I didn’t ask you to fight each other,” Si Luo said as he appeared behind them.</p>
 <p>The silvery-white in his eyes seemed to move, and those pillars of water lost its forms as it splashed everywhere.</p>
 <p>All three of them were splashed with the water and their faces shone brightly under the sun.</p>
 <p>The boy said angrily, “She isn’t even from the Split Zone. She’s only here when she’s dreaming. Why are you being so nice to her?”</p>
 <p>The girl spoke coldly, “Are you his only disciple? We’re supposed to learn how to control air currents together. Why are you always treating me like this?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo cut them off. “That’s enough now. Aren’t you guys hungry?” Their eyes shone at this and the two of them stopped bickering.</p>
 <p>A sweet smile appeared on Si Luo’s beautiful face. “Go over there, I have something good for you. But you’ll have to continue practicing after eating. The both of you haven’t gotten it right because you didn’t manipulate the MF accurately enough while trying to control the water. After you’re done with your meal, I’ll…”</p>
 <p>They were gone before Si Luo could finish.</p>
 <p>Turning around, he saw the boy and girl rush over to a huge boulder where their meal was waiting.</p>
 <p>A mesmerizing smile then appeared on his sunlit face.</p>
 <p>I retracted my hand quickly. I asked in shock, “This is…”</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled and nodded at me. “Yes, you already know the answer. What you’ve just seen is the Jiao S and Gaoqin Jiuye of the past.”</p>
 <p>I was stunned.</p>
 <p>I stood rooted to the ground, speechless.</p>
 <p>Lifting my hand slowly, I put it against Si Luo’s chest again as if possessed by some sort of other-worldly power.</p>
 <p>A scene started playing in front of me.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a continuation of the previous one. This time, it was night. Si Luo and Gaoqin Jiuye were both lying on the grass under a starry sky.</p>
 <p>Si Luo’s white robes seemed to glow faintly in the night, while Gaoqin Jiuye was dressed in black from head to toe, using his hands as a pillow.</p>
 <p>Both of them looked relaxed as they stared at the stars in the sky.</p>
 <p>The picture was indescribable…</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye spoke softly. “Si. I like a girl.”</p>
 <p>Si Luo raised a gentle brow. “Oh, who is it?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s gaze turned gentle as he answered, “A girl in my dreams.”</p>
 <p>Si Luo laughed. “From that world…? Gaoqin, it’s fated that girls from that world can never be with you.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s brows furrowed slightly at Si Luo’s direct answer, but he did not look upset or angry at this. He simply looked a little sad as he said, “This is why I think that it’s also good for me to be here looking at her and protecting her like this…”</p>
 <p>I haven’t seen that look on him before.</p>
 <p>My hand that was against Si Luo’s chest began to tremble.</p>
 <p>Si Luo seemed to smile under the moonlight as he yawned lazily. “Look at that star in the sky. Everything here is created to imitate that world, including that star. Usually, this star here and the star in that world would never ever meet. But what if this happens? Look.” Si Luo lifted a finger and drew a line in the air.</p>
 <p>A ray of MF shot from his finger towards the night sky. The trajectory of that star was changed just like this, and it hit another star.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye’s eyes widened.</p>
 <p>“Do you understand?” A trace of a smile hung on Si Luo’s lips.</p>
 <p>The scene changed again. Si Luo was sitting alone in the forest playing a zither, looking like a handsome music teacher from the ancient times. His slender hands created an enchanting tune.</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye spoiled the beautiful scene as he ran into it, anxiety and worry on his face.</p>
 <p>“Si, she’s in danger. I want to go to that world to save her.” Gaoqin Jiuye sounded anxious, and his eyes were full of worry.</p>
 <p>However, Si Luo was playing his zither like nothing happened.</p>
 <p>“Si!” Gaoqin Jiuye shouted urgently.</p>
 <p>Si Luo lifted his head finally, his eyes filled with love. “Okay, I can tell you a way. But you’re not that good at controlling MF yet. To get that power, you’ll have to conquer a weapon that matches that power. Are you willing to do that?”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye did not seem to be listening to this at all as he answered, “I’m willing, I’m willing.”</p>
 <p>Si Luo plucked a string on his zither. “I’m going to take you to conquer the strongest living weapon in the Split Zone. If you aren’t resolute enough and you can’t endure pain, you won’t be able to do it.”</p>
 <p>Gaoqin Jiuye asked, “Will I obtain great power after I conquer this living weapon? Is it just like your Feng Lie?”</p>
 <p>Si Luo smiled as he looked up. “Yes. This living weapon is called Shen Qi. The prayer of God. It’s stronger than Feng Lie. Are you going to do it?”</p>
