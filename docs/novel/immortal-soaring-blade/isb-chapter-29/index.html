 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenery on both sides continued to change as Zhao Jiuge ran as fast as he could using what spirit force he had left. Faint, golden-colored blood seeped out of the wound left by Xiao Yun from time to time. However, Zhao Jiuge was completely immersed in his memories, so he didn’t notice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was thinking about the lovely Mo Linger and the Mo mansion, who had brought him warm feelings in his heart, but now it was all destroyed by Liu Feng. Zhao Jiuge’s hatred increased—he swore that once his cultivation was powerful enough, he would flatten the Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While immersed in his memories, Zhao Jiuge suddenly felt an aura chasing him. He turned to see people in blood-colored light armor and his eyes narrowed. It was people from the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven figures were moving in the big dipper formation, and their auras were as one. Zhao Jiuge was secretly shocked and wondered if this was the Seven-Star Blood Fiend Formation that Xiao Yi was shouting about. He began cycling the little remaining spirit force he had as they caught up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stopped and looked at the people chasing him. When the seven of them saw Zhao Jiuge stop, they were shocked but also stopped, still maintaining the big dipper formation. Each of them was at the Blood Movement Realm, but there was also a hint of a bloody aura around them. Zhao Jiuge was curious and surprised. The two sides just stared at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person leading had a healthy body and his skin was a bit dark. His brows were sharp like swords and his gaze was locked onto the youth before him. Although this youth was young, no one would underestimate him after the previous performance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!” the leader of the group roared. When he looked at the wound on Zhao Jiuge’s chest, he decided to act without delay. Although the enemy was at the Spirit Transformation Realm, the leader was also very confident in himself and the people with him. The Seven-Star Blood Fiend Formation allowed for attack and defense and also merged the spirit force of seven people into one. It also contained a hint of a bloody aura, making their spirit force more dangerous. The seven of them had also worked together for several years, so they had good teamwork.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the word echoed, seven figures began to rush toward Zhao Jiuge. The blood-red spirit lights from the seven of them connected together, creating this bloody aura. Their aura surged and the pressure they created was no less than Zhao Jiuge’s Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a cold snort. He didn’t hesitate to turn and grab the blue long sword behind his back. He charged at the person in front, the little spirit force he had left surging into his sword. He had been holding in his anger from being chased by Liu Feng, and now was a good time for him to vent. He didn’t believe he couldn’t handle these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The collisions of treasures echoed as Zhao Jiuge rushed through the seven people with the blue longsword. He wasn’t careless this time—he carefully watched these seven people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During that brief exchange, Zhao Jiuge found that when they were using the Seven-Star Blood Fiend Formation, not only was their spirit force not weaker than his, but the blood aura was distracting him. He had to split some focus to deal with that, which made this situation that he thought he could easily resolve become troublesome.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath and no longer hesitated, as he could not let this last. He revealed a determined expression and his spirit force surged into the blue longsword. The sword hummed as if it could not withstand the pressure, and a few dazzling rays of sword light appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rays of sword light flew through the air like rainbows toward the seven people. The person in front formed a seal and the spirit force of the seven people surged forward like a fountain toward the man in front. The spirit force of the seven people formed a blood-colored shield before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored shield became even more solid as more spirit force was injected. It became even more bright red, as if it was bleeding. Finally, even the pattern on the shield could be seen clearly—it was a strange pattern. There was an aura of killing intent around the shield, making it look even more fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pale blue rays of sword light collided with the blood-colored shield and several explosions echoed. The blood-colored shield remained and only became a little dim. The rays of sword light had all collapsed from the collision. The man in front was calm—there were no changes to his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was shocked and was surprised by the mysteriousness of formations. This was the first time he had faced a formation, and it was a good lesson for him. The world was really amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After blocking the blow, the man in front stopped his seal and the blood-colored shield before him slowly disappeared. When the shield completely disappeared, Zhao Jiuge saw that all seven were forming seals at the same time. Their actions were synced up perfectly so that even the fluctuations in the air seemed to form some kind of pattern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sense of danger arose in Zhao Jiuge’s heart. He felt like this attack was stronger than before. He couldn’t help but feel angry at his own lack of strength and not having properly learned—being without a teacher was not good. Right now, with his lack of spirit force, running was not a good idea, and not running was also not a good idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neither side noticed a young girl in black standing on a tree not far away. The girl stared at Zhao Jiuge and disgruntledly muttered, “A complete block of wood, so stupid.” At the same time. there was a look of disgust on her delicate face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying aura spread out, creating ripples in the air. Zhao Jiuge felt the air tighten along with a faint smell of blood, and even the skin on his body tingled. This was the second time he had this feeling! Zhao Jiuge could no longer care about the rest, so he surged his remaining spirit force into his dantian to awaken the golden dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fluctuations in the air were increasing and the smell of blood became even stronger. The seven of them continued to form signs and injected their spirit force, creating a blood-colored lion in the air. It was very life-like and almost seemed real. The greatest advantage of a formation was allowing multiple people to pool their spirit force together, making them much stronger. Also, different formations had different effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored lion’s eyes were closed and its hair even moved with the wind. When Zhao Jiuge looked at the blood-colored lion, he felt like he was sitting on needles as the sense of danger in his heart grew even stronger. Just as the blood-colored lion appeared, Zhao Jiuge saw for certain this time that the smiling buddha in his dantain opened its eyes, causing his almost dried-up spirit force to stir. After some spirit force came out of the laughing buddha, it closed its eyes once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven people finished their seals and let out a collective roar. The blood-colored lion slowly opened its eyes, revealing its red eyes and terrifying aura. It suddenly roared as if it was showing off its might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the golden dragon in Zhao Jiuge’s body seemed to have its dignity provoked and rushed out. It hovered in the air and proudly stared at the blood-colored lion. There was disdain in its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored lion let out another roar and gave the golden dragon a disgruntled look. The surrounding air seemed to solidify from the pressure, and only the sound of the leaves could be heard. The blood-colored lion rushed forward on all fours toward the golden dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden dragon revealed a look of contempt as it floated in the air and lashed its tail at the blood-colored lion. With a bang, the blood-colored lion was knocked flying with pain in its eyes, and its color dimmed a lot. The golden dragon didn’t give it any chance—it dove at the blood-colored lion and coiled around it. In an instant, the blood-colored lion was crushed and disappeared. A thunderous sound echoed within a few dozen kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the blood-colored lion collapsed, the seven people received backlash from the spirit force, causing them to cough out blood. The golden dragon flew proudly in the air and rushed toward the seven of them. They all retreated and covered their bodies in a thin layer of spirit force. The golden dragon seemed to find them boring and returned back into Zhao Jiuge’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was secretly happy at how powerful the Sanskrit Divine Body was, but a powerful sense of weakness washed over him. He endured the discomfort and rushed toward the seven people. There was a flash of viciousness in his eyes—he had to remove the problem at the root. Rays of sword light shot out at the seven guards in blood-colored armor. They had all been seriously injured, so how could they have any spirit force left to protect themselves? Their breath all stopped one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to stop the Flowing Cloud Sect and the Xiao family from chasing him, he had to be ruthless. Zhao Jiuge revealed a bitter smile. There was not a trace of spirit force in his body right now—it had all been devoured by the golden dragon. His face was pale, but the wound on his chest had already sealed and began healing. That was the power of the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t stay for too long, as he was afraid that the sound would attract too much attention and cause people to come here. Fortunately, even without spirit force, his physical body was a lot stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky gradually darkened as Zhao Jiuge walked toward the wilderness. He went toward remote locations instead of any major roads. As he traveled, his spirit force slowly recovered and, just like this, the day became dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Zhao Jiuge didn’t know where he was going. It wasn’t until the moonlight appeared that he took a good look around him and saw that he was actually before a field of unmarked graves. He felt all the hair on his body stand up as he carefully looked around.</span></p>
