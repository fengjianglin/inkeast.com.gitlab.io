 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Instructor Wang didn’t finish his words. “That kid named Zhao Jiuge is a bit mysterious. I can’t see through the spell he cultivates. I don’t know if the two of you see through anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Li also shook his head with doubt. Instructor Zhou recalled everything that had happened since Zhao Jiuge entered the sect. “That child showed this spell during the entrance exam. Although it's mysterious, it doesn't seem extraordinary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Wang cautiously said, “Before the test for the inner sect begins, we have to properly check the histories of these disciples. Huayue Academy and the Ten Thousand Dao Sect have been getting more and more arrogant. Their ambition has begun to show. We must be on guard against them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The appearance of the laughing Buddha around Zhao Jiuge frightened the youth with the scar a little. However, he was confident in himself, and he let out an angry shout with a slightly hoarse voice. “Seven Layer Transformation Technique, first transformation!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light around the Great Earth Ash Bear shined brightly. It revealed its teeth and swiped its claws. It then rushed toward Zhao Jiuge with an extremely fierce and hostile aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t retreat, but charged forward. His heart was filled with anger. Zhao Jiuge felt like he was a little out of control after hearing the insults thrown at him by the youth with the scar. The Sanskrit Heart Sutra was undoubtedly a buddhist practice, and his faith had been influenced by the old man who raised him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar revealed a cruel smile as he rushed forward. The Great Earth Ash Bear waved its powerful arms and kicked off with its hind legs as it rushed forward in a flash. Zhao Jiuge could already smell blood in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the laughing Buddha opened its eyes and revealed a smile that caused one to feel like they were bathing in the spring breeze. Sanskrit chants softly echoed and it stretched out its arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two’s palms collided, and the stone platform under them cracked inch by inch, raising a cloud of dust into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low rumble spread out, and the hostility in the air was diluted and replaced by a refreshing sandalwood fragrance. Zhao Jiuge staggered back two steps, and the youth with the scar also staggered back two steps. Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but feel a bit helpless that he wasn’t even able to hold the advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very proud of the mysterious Sanskrit Divine Body that he cultivated, and he was confident that he could outperform others. When it came to a competition of spirit force, Zhao Jiuge was filled with confidence, and after taking the Spirit Tempering Pill, his spirit force had become even more pure. He thought he had victory in his hands, but he had forgotten that the youth with the scar had also obtained a Spirit Tempering Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could use a Spirit Tempering Pill to change his spirit force and cleanse his meridians, others could do the same!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, taking the Spirit Tempering Pill still had a huge effect. In the past, if he used the powerful Sanskrit Divine Body to the extent that he had used it today, he would have run out of spirit force already. But there was still plenty of powerful spirit force flowing through his body right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After retreating a few steps, the youth with the scar revealed a fierce light in his eyes, refusing to accept defeat. He stepped forward and was going to fight relying on his spirit force. “My Seven Layer Transformations Technique is extraordinary. The first transformation I used is the essence blood of a Great Earth Ash Bear. Although it's not a rare or powerful spirit beast, you are far behind me in terms of strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking the Great Earth Ash Bear’s mighty body leaped into the air and rushed forward. The hair on its body all stood up as if sensing danger, and its eyes were filled with vigilance. The tall and mighty figure, combined with its thick body, was the symbol of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge pursed his lips and didn’t conceal the disdain on his face. His eyes were filled with sarcasm. “Perhaps you might have supreme power once you reach the seventh transformation, but right now, hehe, you’re not qualified. So don’t pretend to be arrogant before me. My Sanskrit Divine Body is a body refinement spell that is shockingly powerful. Let my Buddha light cleanse your bloodthirsty soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he didn’t want to argue with the youth with the scar anymore. He closed his eyes and his mouth muttered something while his hands formed some complicated and mysterious seals. The cross-legged laughing Buddha raised its right hand and drew something before its chest. Then a torrent of golden lights rushed out toward the bear. There were plum petals mixed in the torrent of lights, along with the smell of sandalwood and the sound of Sanskrit chants. The torrent of golden lights were like ribbons that wrapped around the ferocious Great Earth Ash Bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Earth Ash Bear suddenly stopped moving and was uncomfortable with the torrent of golden lights around it. It became restless and stomped its limbs, roaring, but the torrent of golden lights was indifferent, as if it had already attached itself to the bear’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the youth with the scar felt his spirit force deplete rapidly. He ignored it and injected more spirit force into the bear, causing its aura to erupt. The Great Earth Ash Bear had a painful expression when it finally escaped from the torrent of golden lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bear was damaged and the youth with the scar suffered the backlash. He felt his mind and body tremble. It took a moment for him to slowly recover and withdraw the contempt in his eyes, becoming serious. Only now did the youth with the scar consider Zhao Jiuge a real opponent. The strength Zhao Jiuge had shown was worthy of the youth with the scar to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very good, I didn’t expect you to force me to go all out. It’s your honor to lose to me.” The youth with the scar gritted his teeth as he said those words. Right now, the youth with the scar was riding a tiger that was difficult to get off, so he had to win. If he lost, it would be the same as picking up a rock and dropping it on his own foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was already too lazy to speak nonsense with this person, so he rolled his eyes in disdain. His hands moved and another torrent of golden lights flew out from the laughing Buddha. Zhao Jiuge wanted to end this battle quickly. Now that the battle had reached this point, there was no room for either side to hold back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge now admired the person who created this spell even more and respected the light that enveloped him even more. When the laughing Buddha surrounded him, even his restless heart became more peaceful. If possible, Zhao Jiuge really wanted to see what this spell would be like once he reached the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For an offense even stronger than before, the youth with the scar’s expression didn’t change and he urged his spirit force even more to resist. A surge of spirit force rushed forward like a flood, but it was instantly devoured by the torrent of golden lights. Then the torrent of golden lights gathered in the air and unleashed its power on the Great Earth Ash Bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the youth with the scar calmly looked at the torrent of golden lights and closed his eyes. He completely ignored it and seemed to be controlling something. He let the torrent of golden lights come at him and only relied on the instinct of the Great Earth Ash Bear to resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as the torrent of golden lights closed in on the Great Earth Ash Bear, the bear’s claws slashed out to rip it apart. However, it had no effect—the torrent of golden lights split into two and enveloped the Great Earth Ash Bear from left and right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The feeling of being surrounded was still fresh in its mind. The Great Earth Ash Bear shook its body, then all the hair on its body stood up like needles and shot toward the torrent of golden lights. Although the bear looked very fat, it was very agile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when the rainstorm-like shadows touched the torrent of golden lights, the torrent of golden lights devoured everything like the ruthless ocean. This attack didn’t even cause a splash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the laughing Buddha appeared, who would dare to fight it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With an unstoppable aura, the golden lights were about to engulf the Great Earth Ash Bear and the youth with the scar together. On instinct, the youth with the scar surrounded himself with a layer of spirit force. It was this somewhat thin spirit force that caused the torrent golden light to stop for a moment. However, a few breaths later, a crisp sound echoed. In this silent square, it felt very harsh to the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One crack, two cracks, and a series of crackling sounds echoed. Each crack was like a hit to everyone’s hearts, as if a big hand was holding their hearts. Finally, the thin layer of spirit force shattered, causing not only the female disciples, but even some male disciples to let out cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outcome was about to be decided, but soon, everyone became worried about the fate of the youth with the scar that was about to be devoured by the torrent of golden lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three instructors instantly cycled their spirit force and were ready to stop this fight. However, just as they were about to move, they all stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Li was stroking his beard when he exclaimed, “Eh, fluctuations of a magic treasure!” He didn’t think the battle, which he thought was over, was going to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s getting more and more interesting, but I like it, haha.” The amount of times Instructor Zhou had smiled today was more than all the other times combined. It has to be said that making the strict and harsh Instructor Zhou to smile was more difficult than climbing to the top of the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, it wasn’t only the three instructors who discovered that something was wrong. Even the expressions of the older disciples that covered the sky like locusts changed, because the youth with the scar opened his eyes and there was a flash of cold light in his eyes. The drastic change stunned the new disciples below. Their little hearts couldn’t withstand all these sudden changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting, even magic treasures appeared. The new disciples’ family sure is rich.” Wu Tianshan was lazily standing in the air,gently waving the fan in his right hand. He was muttering to himself as if he hadn’t awakened yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The glamorous woman in the white dress and standing on the fiery-red flying sword seemed to have heard Wu Tianshan’s words, and her eyebrows suddenly moved. Then she suddenly looked at Wu Tianshan. When Wu Tianshan noticed the woman looking at him, his lazy expression immediately cleared up. He pretended not to see her and looked at the two people on the stage with a serious expression.</span></p>
