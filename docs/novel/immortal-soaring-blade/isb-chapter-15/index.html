 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the golden-robed youth heard his little sister’s words, the corner of his mouth twitched. He rolled his eyes and said, “Linger, stop making a fool of yourself. How can a girl act like this?” Although he was blaming his little sister, there was not the slightest hint of blame on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the words from the youth in the golden robe, the girl named Linger let go of Zhao Jiuge’s right arm, but her flower-like smile remained as she looked at this poorly dressed young man before her. She suddenly noticed Zhao Jiuge looking at her, and her delicate, white face turned red like a plum blossom in the snow. There was panic in her eyes and she lowered her head to look at the ground, but in her heart, it was like a little deer was running all over the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was no longer the mountain village youth who had never seen the world before. Killing Wang Dazhuang, his strange encounter with his teacher, and finally his meeting with the plain-clothed woman had caused Zhao Jiuge’s heart to change greatly. He was no longer that shy, little kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man quickly walked up and clasped his hands. “Little friend, I have not thanked you for your rescue. If not for you, my family’s young master and lady would have faced a dangerous situation.” At the same time, he observed the young man before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, brother. My name is Mo Shouyi. If not for your rescue, not only would we not get the Blue Moon Grass, but my little sister and I would have faced great danger. I still don’t know your name.” The young man in the golden robe looked very childish, but his words were very old-fashioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge smiled slightly. “Zhao Jiuge. I just couldn't stand their behavior, so no need to thank me.” His words were not humble or arrogant. The old man secretly thought that youth had a righteous appearance, talked calmly, and had the spirit force of a late stage Blood Movement Realm cultivator. Also, from his actions earlier, this youth didn’t look like an indecisive person. He thought about how although his young master was not a useless second generation, he was not someone who would be great in the future. When he himself died, only the family head would be left to support the Mo family. Just thinking about this made him sigh and want to recruit this youth before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s wrinkled filled face revealed a kind smile. “Little friend, the Xiao family won’t let this go so easily, and since this matter is my Mo family’s fault, how about you stay with us for a period of time until this matter is resolved? We will also give some of the refined Blue Spirit Pill to you. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, let my Mo family play the role of host and thank Jiuge.” Mo Shouyi smiled and quickly followed up. “Yes, yes, Big Brother Jiuge should come stay at my house for a while and then there will be someone to play with me.” The little girl named Linger was very happy, with a big smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge silently pondered, and after a while, he thought it was feasible. He had just arrived and knew nothing. It would be good to settle down for a bit to understand the situation, so he gently nodded in response. After seeing Zhao Jiuge agree, the old man and Linger were happy. The old man wanted to recruit Zhao Jiuge to the family, while Mo Linger was purely thinking about her own feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man carefully gathered the Blue Moon Grass and carefully put it away before the four of them walked through the forest. Along the way, Mo Linger would occasionally look at Zhao Jiuge and then shyly lower her head. However, she couldn’t help but secretly look at Zhao Jiuge again. Mo Shouyi looked at his little sister helplessly and the corner of his mouth twitched. He rolled his eyes to show his dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man and Zhao Jiuge continued to talk. The old man kept talking in an attempt to get information from Zhao Jiuge. When he learned that Zhao Jiuge was by himself, he was very happy, but when he asked Zhao Jiuge about his master, Zhao Jiuge didn't give a clear answer. However, the old man didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge also got a rough understanding of the outside world from the old man. Outside the mountain was Dong Yang City, with the Xiao and Mo families as the rulers of the city. Near Dong Yang City was the Flowing Cloud Mountain, which contained the Flowing Cloud Sect, a small sect. Dong Yang City was only a third rate city under the Huaxia Dynasty and was on the border, so there weren't any powerful cultivators here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the human body was a container, then the cultivation method was used to bring spiritual energy into your body. The quality of the cultivation method determined how far you would be able to walk down the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, without a cultivation method, it would take very long to gather spiritual energy, so one wouldn’t be able to reach the next realm before dying of old age. The most powerful Xiao and Mo families only had people at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, so one could imagine how bad the cultivation methods around here were. In Zhao Jiuge’s eyes, the Spirit Transformation Realm was merely the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first realm, the Spirit Detecting Realm, merely allowed one to detect and gather spiritual energy to convert to spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second realm, the Blood Movement Realm, was simply to allow one to have a constant cycle of spirit force and to refine one’s body to become physically stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third realm, the Spirit Transformation Realm, would finally allow one to release spirit force to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fourth realm, the Foundation Realm, was when one could create something similar to a formation inside one’s dantian. This would automatically absorb spiritual energy and refine it into spirit force to allow one to fly in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dong Yang City didn’t even have one Foundation Realm cultivator, which surprised and also disappointed Zhao Jiuge. He wanted to enter a sect to learn, but he really didn’t consider the small sects worthwhile. Fortunately, the Mo family was merely a pit stop. Once he had figured out a route, he would look for a sect to join.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They walked like this for a few days before he finally saw Dong Yang City in the distance. Although it was only a third rate city in the Huaxia Dynasty, Zhao Jiuge realized that it was not small. After all, how could a mountain village be compared to a city? He suppressed his excitement as they quickened their pace toward the Dong Yang City below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing outside the city, he could see the three large words “Dong Yang City” hanging on the city wall. Although it was a third rate city, it was very large, and while standing outside it, Zhao Jiuge could feel the age of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering Dong Yang City, a mix of noises rushed toward Zhao Jiuge. The sounds of people selling, telling stories, and chatting mixed together like music. The streets of Dong Yang City were all straight and not curved. After walking around, Zhao Jiuge had a rough understanding of how to get around the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The romantic street, the lively city center, fragrance of the restaurants, and the traces on the road that had witnessed the age of the city were all very exciting. Zhao Jiuge was filled with curiosity as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Mo, I’ll go visit your home tomorrow. Today, I want to explore Dong Yang City and find an inn to stay at,” Zhao Jiuge whispered to old Mo as he continued to look around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo frowned and said in a blaming tone, “Jiuge, what kind of words are those? You came all the way to Dong Yang City and said you will &nbsp;stay at an inn. That would be like hitting my old face.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about I take Big Brother Jiuge around Dong Yang City and then come back home together at night?” When Mo Linger heard about looking around the city, her eyes lit up. Her lovely face was filled with joy as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing old Mo and Mo Linger’s enthusiasm, Zhao Jiuge felt a bit helpless. He just wanted to quietly walk around the city first. “I just want to explore the city alone first. Tomorrow, I’ll visit you all.” Old Mo tried to persuade Zhao Jiuge, but seeing that Zhao Jiuge wouldn't budge, he gave up. He had to quickly return and tell the family head about what had happened a few days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mo Linger’s little face was filled with unhappiness. She was pouting and her black eyes were filled with bitterness as she stared at Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge was completely occupied with the thought of exploring the city and didn’t notice at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they separated, Old Mo brought Mo Linger and Mo Shouyi toward the Mo family mansion. Zhao Jiuge leisurely walked around the street. Everything looked so novel.</span></p>
