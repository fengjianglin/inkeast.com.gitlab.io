 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

He had been taken to the Ponder Sword Cliff and the Duty Hall by Instructor Zhou via flying sword. How could he know that it would take him so long to walk back with his two feet?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had walked for two days, and there was still one day before he could leave the sect. The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was built on the Mysterious Heaven Mountain Range. The mountain range had hundreds of large and small peaks. Some were too steep to reach by walking, so one had to be at a certain cultivation level to get up there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge remembered those flashy flying swords and strange mounts. When would he be able to have those things? In the end, he was still lacking strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge felt melancholy about how long the path was, he was very happy in his heart. Just thinking about the Blue Plum Sword in his storage ring improved his mood and made his steps lighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had walked for two days already, and he should be able to leave the sect today. The grey steps were like a belt wound around the mountain. On one side was the mountain covered in green, and on the other side was the cliff. Although Zhao Jiuge had been at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Act for a year, he had only been to the Mysterious Heaven Peak, the Ponder Sword Cliff, and the Little Bell Peak, where the Duty Hall and the Treasure Pavilion were. As for the other places, forget going there, he had never even heard about them. He didn’t find the scenery to be boring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the morning wind blew by, the green wave filled with countless trees that Zhao Jiuge couldn’t name swayed. It was a memorable sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, Zhao Jiuge saw some old people sweeping the floor or sitting there cultivating. Most of these elders were wearing plain-looking clothes that were very ordinary. However, Zhao Jiuge knew that these elders were not that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time he encountered someone older, he would lower his head to show respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face didn’t lack determination, and he carried a bag on his back that contained the black clothes he wore before he entered the sect. Those clothes were made by his grandpa, so he was reluctant to throw them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was afraid the Blue Plum Sword would be too eye-catching, so he kept it inside his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another gust of mountain wind blew by, awakening him from his memories. He remembered the old man who was tipping at the edge of life, he remembered the playful Su Su, he remembered how cold the world was, and he remembered Zhao Xiaotian, who shared a similar fate to his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also remembered a lot of familiar faces. These faces suddenly appeared and floated through his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An alluring figure suddenly appeared in his mind—Bai Qingqing. She was a woman he wished he could run away from, but who would have thought that they would become such good friends? If not for her help, he wouldn’t have been able to get the Blue Plum Sword. After all, she had given 100 sect contributions to him. And if it wasn’t for her, he wouldn’t have been able to kill the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf that he had traded it in for 300 sect contributions. Just thinking about this made him smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fickle nature of fate, he would have lived a poor man’s life, never to embark on the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking back at everything that had happened in the past, his footsteps became lighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an unknown amount of time, a small pavilion appeared before Zhao Jiuge’s eyes. Zhao Jiuge let out a long breath. He had finally made it out of the mountains. Zhao Jiuge found this strange. If he had to rely just on his feet, it would take several years to walk through the entire Mysterious Heaven Mountain Range. Fortunately, he had been climbing mountains since he was young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He arrived at the pavilion, where there were several young men wearing black robes. Both of them had a hint of a killing aura and blood-colored swords embroidered on their robes. When Zhao Jiuge got close, he found that even the air became heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at them in awe. There was a total of three exits to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Each exit had members of the Enforcement Hall guarding it, and people constantly patrolled the area just in case. However, nothing had happened in the past thousand years. Not only was the formation protecting the sect, there were also many powerful cultivators who kept tabs on this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those young men with killing intent glanced at Zhao Jiuge. After they confirmed that everything was fine, they withdrew their gazes and no longer cared about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw that there was no problem, he walked forward. He then turned around and revealed a self-deprecating smile. He couldn’t blame those disciples from influential families for looking down upon them. No matter what he saw, he was envious of it. Now he was a bit envious of the Enforcement Hall’s robes, not to mention all the treasures and strange items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He threw aside all the distracting thoughts and quickly left his place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before Zhao Jiuge walked far, he suddenly looked back and turned around. How had he walked out so easily? Wasn’t there supposed to be a formation protecting the sect? How come he hadn’t seen it? Zhao Jiuge couldn’t figure it out and was too lazy to think about it. He looked at the wooden token to determine the location of the town of Yu Hua and headed towards that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the day was almost over, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes lit up. After turning a corner, he saw a house, farmland, and smoke rising into the air. It was like a peaceful, otherworldly garden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s lips were slightly dry as he whispered, “I finally made it out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a year, Zhao Jiuge finally saw the people and scenery of the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding air was filled with smoke from the house, and he looked into the distance. He should have made it out of the mountain and this should be the suburbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, there were only two to three houses side by side, and outside was a large farmfield. The smoke was rising from one of the houses that was beside a small bamboo forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A burly middle-aged man who had his sleeves and trousers rolled up was busily working in the field. At the corner of the farmland, there was an old, tired-looking black and yellow cow casually wagging its tail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a five or six-year-old child sitting on the back of the cow. The child was wearing a red vest and loose pants with no shoes. As the child rode on the old cow, they were playing with their fingers. Only a small clump of hair on the middle of the child’s head remained, and the rest was all shaved off, making them very cute. The child would look back at their dad from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this familiar scene, Zhao Jiuge felt warmth in his heart. Perhaps these people were not rich, but their lives were filled with happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything here seemed like an otherworldly garden, perhaps because he hadn’t seen something like this in a long time. He swallowed and then prepared to inquire about his destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge left the sect, he changed back to his black robe and carefully put the blue sword robe in the bag he had carried down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His footsteps attracted the attention of the burly middle-aged man, and he stared at Zhao Jiuge. His face was sunburned from working in the field and contained hints of doubt and vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle, I want to ask how far the town of Yu Hua is from here.” Zhao Jiuge revealed an honest smile. He even scratched his head with his right hand as if he was a bit embarrassed to ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the unfamiliar youth asking for directions, the middle-aged man stopped and carefully examined Zhao Jiuge. The cheap clothes and the honest expression made the middle-aged man relax his vigilance a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man smiled softly and then pointed the direction of the town for Zhao Jiuge. “The town of Yu Hua is not far from here, only about 20 kilometers that way. Little Brother, are you traveling alone?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge gently nod, he looked at his son riding on the old cow in the corner of the field. Then he calmly said, “I just finished my work and am about to head home, we can walk and talk.” Then he placed the child on his shoulders and his free hand led the old cow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although people in the mountains were honest, the careful middle-aged man was still vigilant. However, he was still very enthusiastic and answered all of Zhao Jiuge’s questions. The two talked and laughed while they walked. Soon, they were 100 meters from the house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The child sitting on his dad’s shoulder stared curiously at Zhao Jiuge. It seemed like he rarely saw unfamiliar people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing voices from outside, the woman cooking in the house walked out. She was in her late 30s and was still good-looking. She was wearing a green skirt and a wooden hairpin that gave her a certain charm. She was a bit surprised to see an unfamiliar person and felt a bit embarrassed. However, when she saw that it was only a child, she relaxed a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t say anything, she only looked at her husband. Then a young couple walked out of the house nearby because they were also attracted by the sound of talking. The young man was a little thin, and when he saw an outsider, his hands clenched onto a farm sickle while he stared at Zhao Jiuge. The suburban wilderness was not the same as a town, so you couldn’t blame them for being so careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the young man was a young woman who had her hair wrapped up and held a baby wrapped in a blanket. From the looks of it, she had given birth not long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man protected the young woman behind him and carefully watched Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge was not dumb—he realized what was happening. However, he understood why. Sometimes, you just have to be more vigilant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be nervous, I just want to ask for directions. After I get the directions, I’ll leave and I won’t bother you anymore.” Zhao Jiuge smiled apologetically and felt somewhat embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he burly middle-aged man heard this, all suspicion in his heart disappeared. He also felt a bit embarrassed. He looked up at the sky and said, “How about you eat a meal before you go? As long as you don’t mind the meager food.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth remained unmoved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly shook his head. “No need. Thank you, Uncle, but I still need to hurry along on my journey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere was a bit oppressive and they didn’t know what to say. The middle-aged man looked at Zhao Jiuge but didn’t advise him to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt a bit awkward. Seeing how everyone was staring at him, he couldn’t stay much longer, so he said his thanks once more and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He walked through the field and looked back at the two families. He saw the child first climb around his father’s shoulder and then onto the old cow’s back to play. Zhao Jiuge longed for this kind of warmth from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finding that he was only about 20 kilometers from the town of Yu Hua, his mood became better. The fatigue from traveling the last few days had unknowingly faded away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He started jogging in the direction of the town. One could see a youth in black with a bright smile on his face running through the fields.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of a youth happily singing echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Walking on the country road.</span></p>

The song echoed through the countryside.</span></p>
