 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep in the mountains, a lone youth was slowly walking through the forest. It had been half a month since he successfully formed the golden dragon and the Sanskrit spirit. The youth carefully observed his surroundings as he walked through the silent forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some spirit force fluctuations suddenly came from the distance, causing Zhao Jiuge to frown. He looked toward the source and quickly rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Old Man Mo, leave behind the Blue Moon Grass and take your family’s little young master and lady away. Otherwise, I’ll change my mind.” There was a burly man who looked to be about 40 years old. He had a long scar going from his forehead to the corner of his eye that made him look very fierce. Although he was laughing arrogantly, he gave off a powerful killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The burly man was releasing his spirit force and was surrounded by a pale yellow light while holding a large, blood-colored blade that was also emitting spirit force fluctuations. He was at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, and the large blade in his hand was a magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him stood a beautiful youth about the same size as Zhao Jiuge who wore a silver robe and had long, flowing hair. His face had distinct features, and at this moment, there was a smile on his face. His eyebrows made him look a bit gloomy and his slender, white fingers held a long sword covered in a light blue light—it was another magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were fluctuations of spirit force, none of it was released outside of the body because he was at the early stage of the Blood Movement Realm. Behind him stood five lightly armored guards with ordinary weapons staring at the opposite side. They seemed to be ready to act at any moment and there were faint spirit force fluctuations coming from them as well. They were all around the Spirit Detecting Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Xiao family is too much. We found the Blue Moon Grass first. Xiao Zhan, you have become more and more unreasonable!” On this side, there was the figure of an old man who had messy hair and thick brows. He was an ordinary-looking old man, but his spirit force light was even stronger than that of the person called Xiao Zhan—late stage of Spirit Transformation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was guarding a girl and a boy that were around 11 or 12 years old. The boy was wearing a golden robe and his youthful eyes were filled with anger like a stubborn, little lion cub. Due to his anger, his fingers holding his long sword had turned white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl wore a long, yellow dress, and the breeze pushed the dress against her body. Her face was delicate and her features distinct. She was flustered and seemed confused. There were faint spirit force fluctuations from both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rules? Aren’t rules set by the strong? I’m afraid your Mo family can’t afford to devour that Blue Moon Grass.” Xiao Zhan’s voice was filled with sarcasm and disdain. “What’s more, you know how precious the Blue Moon Grass is. With it, you can make the Blue Spirit Pill, and as for its effects, I don’t need to say.” After he finished talking, he looked at the Blue Moon Grass between the two groups of people. When Xiao Zhan thought about the Blue Spirit Pill that might finally help him break through the bottleneck he had been stuck in, he subconsciously swallowed and his eyes became filled with greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge observed the two sides and the gently swaying Blue Moon Grass. After hearing their words, he had a rough understanding of what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xiao Zhan’s words, the old man from the Xiao family became even more gloomy. How could he not know the effect of the Blue Moon Grass? It was precisely because of this that he could not retreat. However, at the same time, he was afraid. Originally, he had come to the mountains with the young master and lady to cultivate and hopefully allow them to reach the Blood Movement Realm. However, they had unexpectedly found the Blue Moon Grass, and just before they could take it, Xiao Zhan arrived with the Xiao family’s second young master, Xiao Yu. They also saw the Blue Moon Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, you’re not afraid that my Mo family will come find you later?” If he were by himself, he could take the Blue Moon Grass and escape since he was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, but with the young master and lady here, he could only intimidate the other party with the Mo family name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, before, my Xiao family might’ve been afraid of your Mo family, but not now. My big brother has been accepted into the Flowing Cloud Sect. So what if your Mo family comes for revenge?” the young man in the silver robe said, his eyes filled with disdain. His words contained pure arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Xiao Yu’s words, the old man of the Mo family became silent and felt bitter. In Dong Yang City, the Mo and Xiao families were the strongest. The Mo family had two late stage Spirit Transformation Realm cultivators, while the Xiao family only had their family head and Xiao Zhan. However, a while ago, something suddenly changed. The first young master, Xiao Yun, reached the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm at the age of 20 and was accepted as a disciple of the nearby Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, thinking about how precious the Blue Moon Grass was and how it would allow him to break through, the old man’s eyes became fierce. At the same time, the spirit force around him became brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” Xiao Zhan, who had been observing the old man, suddenly became alert and activated his spirit force as well. A big battle was about to begin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man from the Mo family held up his pale cyan longsword and a gentle wind wrapped around it. The sharp blade extended out and left a shallow cut on the hard ground. The body of the sword gradually rose up and pointed at Xiao Zhan as the sunlight reflected off the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Zhan’s palm gradually grasped the blade and suddenly drew it. A powerful pressure smashed into the ground and a gust of wind blew the dust away. A faint, yellow spirit force appeared on the blade as he pointed it at the old man from the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other people from the two sides quickly retreated to not be affected by the battle. After all, Xiao Zhan was only at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, one realm below the old man. His spirit force was not as strong and he could not withstand the pressure, so he was forced to act first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Zhan raised the large, blood-colored blade, and after a few steps, he leaped toward the old man. This leap caused cracks to spread across the forest with his foot as the center. The ray of blade light flew forward as the old man raised his longsword and a ray of sword light shot out. The two lights touched and the blade light melted like snow facing the blazing sun. It slowly melted until nothing remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword light that easily pierced the blade light shot toward Xiao Zhan. Xiao Zhan quickly raised his blade and the sword light smashed into it. The sword light finally disappeared as all the spirit force sindie was gone, but Xiao Zhan was forced back one step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Zhan’s pupils shrunk. The old man was worthy of being at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm. His spirit force was stronger. He took a deep breath and a yellow light flashed through his body. At this moment, his spirit force became more profound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s expression became serious when he saw Xiao Zhan’s spirit force rise. He no longer gave Xiao Zhan any time and rapidly brandished this sword five times, sending out five rays of sword energy. The old man’s face became paler. Using spells consecutively like this had consumed a lot of his spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Zhan’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch when he saw the old man shoot out five rays of sword light. His expression combined with his scar made his face look even more vicious. His spirit force surged and an armor made of spirit force appeared on Xiao Zhan’s body. It covered his whole body and shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the five rays of sword light closed in, Xiao Zhan shot out a ray of spiritual force toward them, and at the same time, he waved his large blade. There was a series of explosions that happened one after the other. First, the ray of spirit force collided with one ray of sword light. Then the large, blood-colored blade hit two rays of sword light, and finally the last two rays shot toward Xiao Zhan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One flying sword light stabbed into the armor that had appeared on Xiao Zhan’s body, forcing him to retreat a few steps. The sword light disappeared and the armor around Xiao Zhan became dim, but it didn’t break. Just at this moment, the last sword light closed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a thunderous bang as the sword tip pierced into the surface of the armor. The armor cracked and broke, but the sword light also dimmed. The sword light pierced Xiao Zhan’s body and he was sent flying into the ground. There was blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth, his whole face was pale, and his eyebrows were furrowed due to the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Xiao, are you ok?” After seeing Xiao Zhan being sent flying, the second young master of the Xiao family ran up, filled with worry. “No problem, no internal damage.” Xiao Zhan waved his hand and gloomily stared at the old man from the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go keep the old man busy, you all go deal with the young ones.” Xiao Zhan’s words were vicious, and he immediately charged at the old man. Hearing those words, the old man from the Mo family became angry and shouted, “You dare!” Although anxious, with Xiao Zhan here, he could only fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force fluctuations of the battle between Xiao Zhan and the old man shook the entire forest. As their spirit force lashed out, broken tree branches fell everywhere. As the two fought, Xiao Yu dashed toward the young master and lady of the Mo family with killing intent. The blue light on his sword shined brightly.</span></p>
