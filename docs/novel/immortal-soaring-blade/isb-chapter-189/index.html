 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Only after all five people on the other side had released their spirit force did he finally let go of the weakened Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly stepped forward. When he passed by Luo Xie, his lips moved slightly. When Luo Xie heard Zhao Jiuge’s words, he was shocked and found it estranged. However, he still nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jealous and unhappy youth had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. He was filled with anger and stared unblinkingly at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge glanced at the youth with the scar and found it very funny. Although there was nothing between him and Bai Qingqing, he wanted to anger the youth with the scar. A frivolous smile appeared on his face and he moved his right hand under his nose to smell it. He revealed a look of enjoyment as the fragrance still lingered on his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s face became even more red when she saw Zhao Jiuge’s teasing action. She scolded in her mind,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little hooligan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar could not endure it anymore. His chest heaved up and down and he gloomily questioned, “Right now, you’re worse than a dog and you’re in the mood to pretend to be cool before a woman?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge squinted at the youth with the scar and sarcastically said, “Why do you care? I have the ability to pretend before a woman, you don’t even have that. If you have the ability, go find a woman and pretend to be cool before her for me to see.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he no longer looked at the youth with the scar. He slightly closed his eyes and exclaimed, “Fragrant, really fragrant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Yinger’s face became even colder and she turned her head. She didn’t want to see Zhao Jiuge's current expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Keep pretending. I want to see what you can do now. You better have the ability to deal with all five of us at once. If not, then watch me beat you until you beg for mercy.” The youth with the scar revealed a cruel smile and he licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge heard this, he was too lazy to listen. He lazily said, “I said before that if I was able to beat you until you couldn’t move once, I can do it again. So what if there are five of you now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun slowly stepped forward and said in a heavy tone, “Don’t be too arrogant.” Today he was going to make his first move against Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to be arrogant, are you going to bite me? A man should not be so indecisive. I have waited for so long, but since none of you will make a move, then I will.” Zhao Jiuge had grown impatient and he could give it his all. He still had one ace left, but as for the outcome, he would only know once he used it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, his originally weakened aura slowly changed and began to surge. The spirit light that had disappeared resurfaced and emitted a faint glow. His aura was still on the rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His blood-stained blue sword robe started to flutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His sword robe fluttered without any wind. The vitality of youth seemed to move with this invisible wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge gather the spirit force in his body, the youth with the scar shouted in disdain, “Acting all mysterious, let’s see what you can even do!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Bai Zimo stepped forward two steps, leaving Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger in the back. The three of them stood side by side, and Bai Zimo whispered, “Be careful, this brat is really strange. We better not lose to some trick—that would be truly embarrassing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s gaze swept past the three of them and he thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, idiots, for once again underestimating me and giving me time. I told you I have an ace saved and you won’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an obvious lack of practical experience. In these situations, one small thing could cause the entire situation to change. Looking at the situation, it seemed like the order he had whispered to Luo Xie was pointless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar sneered, “A bumpink is really a bumpkin. You had a magic treasure-grade flying sword, but now it's broken.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then three crisp sounds echoed and three different colored flying swords appeared. They held the swords tightly in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three flying swords had different shapes and lengths, but they were all shining and the space around their edges were slightly distorted. All three flying swords were spirit treasure-grade, but in terms of quality, they were much worse than Bai Qingqing’s Wind Flower Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge really wanted to curse out loud when he saw this. Spirit treasures seemed to be worthless and everyone had one, yet he was working so hard for just a precious treasure-grade flying sword. If you constantly compare yourself to others, you will anger yourself to death. The foundations of these influential families were not ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even though he didn’t have a flying sword, did that mean that he had no other ace up his sleeve?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After stalling for all this time, it was time for him to make his move. Zhao Jiuge’s eyes lit up and &nbsp;the golden light around him flickered. Then his hands moved to form seals and a strange fluctuation spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar still dreaded this scene. Seeing the familiar seals, the youth with the scar shouted, “Golden Dragons!”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he soon reacted. He was very different from when he had just entered the sect. Did Zhao Jiuge think he could win with just two golden dragons? What’s more, they had five people on their side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ray of golden light shined and ripples followed. A golden dragon ⅔ of a meter long suddenly appeared. It was very lifelike and each of its scales was clearly visible. The dragon’s roar echoed, its tail swayed side to side, and it raised its head arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, another golden dragon appeared in the sky. The two golden dragons swayed side to side next to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar sneered,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The same old trick? Is this what you called your ace? I thought it would be something amazing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the next moment, his pupils shrank because there was another flash of golden light. It looked like there was another golden dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that bright light appeared, another golden dragon materialized in the sky. Three golden dragons!</span></p>

He didn’t think Zhao Jiuge’s spell could increase in power. The memory of being beaten by these golden dragons was still fresh in his mind.</span></p>

During that half a month, not only had he managed to condense the third dragon, but he also found out something special about the Sanskirt Divine Body. However, it had cost him more than 3,000 spirit stones, so it made his heart ache. He wanted to see just how much the power of the golden dragons could display when their numbers increased.</span></p>

He pointed the cyan flying sword in his hand toward the golden dragon charging at him. Then a light gradually surrounded his body like armor. He defended himself and attacked at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being able to form a layer of spirit force armor around one’s body was the sign of the Spirit Transformation Realm, but at the Foundation Realm, one would be able to keep it up constantly.</span></p>

He quickly released his spirit force to surround his body. He went completely on the defensive and only sent out a blow to test the power of the golden dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar was the last one to react; he only reacted after he saw Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo move.

There was a flash of light before his chest and a mirror appeared before him. The mirror looked like it was made of jade and was the size of one’s face. After it appeared, the youth with the scar quickly grabbed it with his right hand and injected spirit force into it. The originally dim mirror suddenly began to shine brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mirror was also a rare spirit treasure, and it could rebound most spirit force attacks. It was one of the two spirit treasures he had brought from his family, the other being the flying sword in his hand. His family was worried he would be bullied, so they had given it to him.</span></p>
