 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge arrived at the square, he was filled with energy. It was as if something about him had changed, but no one knew what exactly. All the older disciples carefully observed the youth coming toward the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were clear, his long, black hair was tied with a black cloth, and there was no trace of emotion on his handsome face. His expression was as calm as the weather, and his blue sword robe made his figure look a little thin. His back was facing the sun, and the early morning breeze lifted the corner of his robe. Just his appearance alone caused some of the female disciples' eyes to light up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the sky covered in people riding mounts or standing on flying swords shocked Zhao Jiuge. He was wondering what had happened for all these people to gather. There were even people with aura no weaker than that of the cold and noble woman that appeared at the cold pool that day, Bo Re.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing that everyone was watching him, even Zhao Jiuge felt his face become a bit hot, even though he was no longer the introverted boy from before. He arrived next to Bai Qingqing and company and softly asked, “Why are there so many people here today? What kind of situation is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing lowered her head and whispered, “We also don’t know. A lot of people suddenly arrived. They are all older disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. I guess someone spread the news. The battle between you and the youth with the scar was originally a small event, but now I don’t think it will be so simple. Be careful, I’m optimistic about you.” Looking at the current situation even she felt nervous for Zhao Jiuge. If he lost, it would be difficult to get out of this situation. However, he could only do his best, because everything was already set in motion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, okay, since everyone is here, let’s begin. Let’s get this started. It’s a competition between members of the same sect, so there will be no killing, don’t overdo it. We instructors will be here to protect you, so display all your strength.” Instructor Zhou’s words were stern. When he finished, he released his powerful aura, which made people's hearts feel a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Li just rubbed his beard and smiled kindly. He also wanted to see how far the potential of this group of disciples could go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Instructor Zhou finished speaking, the youth with the scar revealed a cruel smile and didn’t bother hiding his ill intent. He looked directly at Zhao Jiuge with a playful smile as if he didn’t take Zhao Jiuge seriously. It was as if he had already won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished staring, he looked at Bai Qingqing, who was standing charmingly next to Zhao Jiuge. She no longer had that charming appearance but was filled with worry. When she heard that the fight was about to start, she couldn’t help but say, “Be careful. If you lose, don’t say you know me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch, and he fiercely rolled his eyes. He irritably said, “It’s all because of you. If not for you, would the youth with the scar have picked a fight with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar had seen Bai Qingqing on the stairs. He was shocked by her appearance and was infatuated by this alluring girl. However, whenever he saw Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge close together, he would become filled with anger. Now he could finally resolve those grievances. Today, everyone would know who was stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble, rumble, rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone retreated and then a platform several hundred meters wide slowly rose from the ground. Instructor Zhou formed seals with his hand and then shot out a ray of spirit force onto the platform. The platform that was several hundred meters wide and raised up in the sky was surrounded by a light curtain. This locked Zhao Jiuge and the youth with the scar inside. A strange aura flowed through the light curtain, and it had a strange pattern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere reached a boiling point!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two people faced each other, but neither took the lead. They coldly looked at each other. It would be a lie to say that Zhao Jiuge was not nervous. It was unknown if it was excitement or something else; he felt unnatural, and it felt like his body was shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the stage, everyone supported someone different. They were all cheering to the point that their faces turned red and their voices turned hoarse. Even the youths in the air found it interesting. The outside of the stage was more lively than the two people on the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the youth with the scar became impatient and frowned. The next moment, a buzzing sound came from his body and his aura surged. His late stage of Spirit Transformation Realm strength revealed itself. When the youth with the scar made his move, the noise outside the stage abruptly stopped and everyone widened their eyes to look at the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar’s aura continued to rise. His aura was like a peerless beast opening its bloody mouth to let out a roar, revealing its fangs and waiting to devour its opponent. Feeling the power through his body, the youth with the scar became even more confident. He was already thinking about how he was going to deal with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the light curtain around the stage, the people outside couldn’t feel the pressure from youth with the scar’s aura. However, Zhao Jiuge could clearly feel the oppression that made his body feel stiff, but he stood tall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge saw the youth with the scar’s disgusting face, he felt unhappy.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you think I’m someone easy to bully, I’ll take this opportunity to make you my first stepping stone after entering the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sword robe trembled and his eyes were clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the pressure from the youth with the scar, Zhao Jiuge’s clothes flapped loudly. Even his black hair was moving. At this moment, the youth with the scar’s power seemed to reach a peak, and he was trying to suppress Zhao Jiuge with his pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar was like a peerless beast ready to set off a storm, but Zhao Jiuge suddenly revealed an inexplicable smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter how much of a raging storm you are, I’m the lone blade of grass on the mountain that sways with the wind but will not fall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the connoisseurs recognized the artistry, the layman simply enjoyed the show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge stood still, as if he was frightened silly by the youth with the scar. The youth with the scar was filled with spirit, and spirit light flashed around him. His powerful aura shocked the disciples that were only at the Blood Movement Realm and Spirit Detecting Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Tianshan and the powerful inner disciples knew that when facing an enemy, one should be like Zhao Jiuge. Even though life or death could be determined in an instant, once one is at their peak state, they’re also not far away from exhaustion. Zhao Jiuge’s indifferent and calm expression made Instructor Zhou nod with a trace of admiration. On the other hand, Instructor Li looked at the youth with the scar with a smile. It was obvious the two instructors had their own favorites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar finally couldn’t bear this atmosphere anymore, because he had to maintain this state. He grabbed the wooden sword on his back with his right hand and raised it before him. An extraordinary aura released from his body and he had an arrogant expression on his face. “Looking at you, I don’t know what kind of hole you jumped out of. You don’t have any family background, and I don't even need to use any other magic treasures to bully you. Just this wooden word is enough to deal with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A person shouldn’t be too arrogant. Are you not afraid of being slapped in the face?” After hearing the words from the youth with the scar, Zhao Jiuge felt his head swell a little and he could not control himself. Killing intent erupted from his eyes, and at this moment, Zhao Jiuge decided he wouldn’t hold back. He was going to teach this youth with the scar a lesson because he was more annoying than Bai Zimo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m arrogant. I have the ability to be. Do you?” Facing Zhao Jiuge’s words, the youth with the scar smiled instead of becoming angry. His face was filled with disdain and his eyebrows were raised. His tone was extremely arrogant, as if no one could question him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll let you see if I have the ability!” With an angry roar, Zhao Jiuge could not hold back any longer. His breathing became rough as he rushed forward toward the youth with the scar. He drew the wooden sword on his back. As he rushed forward, he released his spirit force and his aura gradually increased. However, he was only at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, so his cultivation was a bit weaker than that of the youth with the scar, making it so he was slightly overwhelmed. However, the oppressive force he felt disappeared when he released his spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Battle intent appeared in the eyes of the youth with the scar as he watched Zhao Jiuge rush toward him. His eyes narrowed and he coldly snorted. “An insignificant skill that's best kept hidden from the public!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he also grabbed his wooden sword and rushed toward Zhao Jiuge. The eyes of the bystanders became fiercer as everyone awaited their collision. The spirit force released by the two of them even caused the surroundings to be distorted a little. The next moment, something shocking occurred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open Fan Raised Oar, Soft Yet Unyielding, Little Oar Boat, Grass Creek Hanging Silk!” The youth with the scar suddenly yelled out the moves of the Sword Energy Elucidation, then a bright light surged from his wooden sword. The originally wooden sword exuded lightning-like light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Small Boat One Leaf, Great River Drill, Vast Cold Wave!” The youth with the scar didn’t give Zhao Jiuge any time to respond. When he finished chanting, the youth with the scar shifted his sword and fiercely stabbed toward where Zhao Jiuge was heading. Because of their speed, Zhao Jiuge could not dodge that stab.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ordinary stab was like a lonely boat piercing through the vast ocean. No matter how violent the waves and wind were, the lonely boat would still bravely sail forward. The youth with the scar had gained a preliminary understanding of sword intent!
