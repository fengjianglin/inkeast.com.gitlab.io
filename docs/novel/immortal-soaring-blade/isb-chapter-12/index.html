 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slept all the way until morning and opened his sleepy eyes. He stretched and let out a lazy yawn, feeling very spirited. However, thinking about the plain-clothed woman in his dream, he suddenly became slightly dispirited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt the spirit force surging through his body as he watched the sun shining into the cave. Zhao Jiuge’s mood was very good, and now that he had reached the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm, he was constantly absorbing spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked out of the cave and made his way through the valley. There he saw Little Black jumping through the trees in the jungle, playing around. Zhao Jiuge shouted from a distance, “Little Black!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a kick of his hind feet, Little Black jumped to another tree after hearing Zhao Jiuge. Then Little Black landed on the ground and rushed toward the youth in the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After jumping on Zhao Jiuge’s shoulder, Little Black pulled the youth’s hair and played around. When Little Black saw Zhao Jiuge wince in pain, he let out a cheerful cry and looked at Zhao Jiuge joyfully. Although Little Black had gained intelligence and was following the same path as his mother, he had not lost his wildness, so he still loved to mess around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge laid down on the grass in the middle of the valley with a straw of grass in his mouth. He slowly chewed and let the faint fragrance of the grass spread throughout his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His left hand caressed the obedient Little Black crouching next to him. He raised his slightly dark right palm to block the dazzling light from the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Black, now that I have broken through to the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm, it won’t be long before we leave the valley. You should play to your heart’s content here while you can.” The youth was deep in thought as he had too many things to think about. Not only did he have to go to the Carefree Valley his teacher had talked about, but the distant figure of the plain-clothed woman was still in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally docile Little Black suddenly became very excited after hearing Zhao Jiuge’s words. He continued to screech as he waved his little hands around, signaling something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Black what’s the matter?” Zhao Jiuge could not understand what Little Black was trying to convey. Aftering seeing this, there was a trace of sorrow in Little Black’s eyes as he pulled Zhao Jiuge’s sleeve and pointed toward where his mother was buried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge somewhat understood what Little Black meant when he pointed at his mother's grave. “You don’t want to leave the valley, right?” After so many days, Zhao Jiuge had gotten used to Little Black’s company and had grown very attached, but Little Black didn’t want to leave the place where his mother was buried. He had just stepped into the cultivation world—he couldn't stay here. At this moment, his heart felt heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Black’s emotions were a bit high as he continued to pull Zhao Jigue while pointing at his mother’s grave. He kept shaking his head while screeching. Zhao Jiuge, feeling Little Black’s desperate mood, quickly hugged him and said, “You don’t want me to leave, right? But I have too much to do. Once I become stronger, I’ll come back to visit you, okay?” Little Black’s eyes were filled with reluctance and tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moon that night was as round as a disk and the sky was covered in stars. The cave was not filled with the usual laughter; it was particularly quiet. Tonight was their last night together, and both were very quiet. The night breeze flew by and the cave was filled with a sense of reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge finished packing up the next morning and was prepared to leave. He carefully looked at the valley he had spent several months in. He had experienced too many things here, and most important of all was the time he had spent with Little Black. On his way out, he wanted to engrave everything in his mind before he said his farewell to the valley and Little Black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of branches rustling echoed behind him. Little Black was following him with teary eyes. “Go back, Little Black. Once I reach the Spirit Core Realm, I’ll come back to visit you.” Then he left without turning back. Although he was very unwilling to leave, he could not be too sentimental now. However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t know that by the time he came back, everything would have changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun shined through the gaps between the branches and stretched out his shadow. At this moment, the youth’s shadow seemed so lonely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge passed the pool, he stopped. The damage from the battle from before was still there. However, this time, without the plain-clothed woman and Little Black, the mood was different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He jumped into the pool and felt the cold energy inside. Without the waterfall and the flood dragon, Zhao Jiuge could feel that the cold energy was slowly disappearing from the pool. He calmed down and began to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body as his eyes burned with passion. Now that he had broken through to the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm, he was going to see if he could cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body and reach the first stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spirit force cycled and the cold energy in the pool quickly entered his body. He felt a sharp pain as the mix of spiritual energy and cold energy entered his body. There were flashes of light as Zhao Jiuge accelerated the absorption rate. His hands trembled and white gas spewed out from his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spirit force gathered all the sparkling light together and slowly fused with it, becoming more and more pure. After half a day, the sparkling light was now the size of a goldfish. As he continued to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body, the rest of his spirit force also gathered together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a large mouthful of foul air and continued to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body. Time quickly passed, and soon he was at the most critical step of the Sanskrit Divine Body, the last step to refine the defining feature of the first stage of the Sanskrit Divine Body: the golden dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to use even more complex hand signs compared to before, and Zhao Jiuge began to sweat. His sweat mixed with the coldness of the pool, a pale, white mist surrounding his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very tired, but he continued to refine his spirit force with the Sanskrit Divine Body until the outline of the golden dragon finally appeared. However, due to his unfamiliarity with the signs, there was a moment of pause and the outline collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He failed again and again, but he continued to try again and again. Zhao Jiuge saw hope and became disappointed over and over again. Fortunately, his lonely early life had made him very determined, so he continued to endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A burst of dragon cries suddenly echoed through his body and a palm-sized golden dragon appeared inside him. The golden dragon still needed to stay inside his dantian to be slowly nourished while a buddha sat in his dantian. The success of reaching the first stage of the Sanskrit Divine Body had made the buddha golden glow even stronger. At this moment, there was a layer of golden light around Zhao Jiuge’s body, and as the golden dragon moved through his body, the sound of a dragon’s roar echoed inside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ripples started to spread across the pool and a powerful aura flowed out from Zhao Jiuge. The corner of the youth’s mouth rose up and he began to laugh. For the first time in his life, he felt what it was like to be strong. Looking at the golden light around him, he muttered, “Is this the power of the Sanskrit Divine Body? Legend has it that those who reach the ninth stage of the Sanskrit Divine Body become invincible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was still immersed in the joy of obtaining power. He couldn’t help but feel like he was one step closer to that cold and arrogant woman!</span></p>
