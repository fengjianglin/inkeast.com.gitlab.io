 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

In fact, when he heard that he could go to the Duty Hall, he was so happy that he smiled until his eyes became lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Instructor Zhou, I’ll go now, but where is the Duty Hall? I have never gone there before, I’ll have to trouble Elder to take me there.” Zhao Jiuge smiled while scratching the side of his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou only took a faint look at Zhao Jiuge and then turned around. Then he simply said, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou knew that if this gentle and honest youth went crazy, he was more terrifying than anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge followed Instructor Zhou outside the courtyard. Instructor Zhou was going to wave his sleeve and bring Zhao Jiuge onto the flying sword. However, when he saw how absent-minded Zhao Jiuge was, he seemed to guess what Zhao Jiuge was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t bother, Bai Qingqing has entered a spirit vein to cultivate. She has reached the Foundation Realm and has comprehended Elucidation. I really don’t know what to do with you, being even worse than a little girl. After a year, it looks like you only touched the realm of Elucidation.” At first, Instructor Zhou was angry, but the more he spoke, the more happy he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was scolding and criticizing Zhao Jiuge, he felt very satisfied. He felt that Zhao Jiuge’s progress was very good, considering his background and having no one to help him. He believed that Zhao Jiuge only needed to take some missions to hone himself in order to comprehend Elucidation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was much better than those disciples with good backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing that Bai Qingqing had already gone into a spirit vein to refine her body, Zhao Jiuge was a bit shocked, but he soon calmed down. No wonder he hadn’t seen her even though he had been back for a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those poor disciples might not know what this meant, but he knew what it was from the jade tube left by his teacher, Ye Wuyou. There was detailed information about going from the Spirit Detecting Realm to the Blood Movement Realm, from the Blood Movement Realm to the Spirit Transformation Realm, and then from the Spirit Transformation Realm to forming the foundation formation to forming one’s spirit core and nascent soul. As for the realms beyond the Nascent Soul Realm, there was no information, as Ye Wuyou was afraid Zhao Jiuge would look too far ahead and delay his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the Mysterious Heaven Temple looming in the clouds Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh. When would he be able to enter that position?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about his deceased teacher, Ye Wuyou, he remembered that he still had to take a trip to the place called Carefree Valley.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s gaze of determination, Instructor Zhou didn’t say more. Some people only needed a few words to point them in the right direction, saying more would be pointless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He rolled up his sleeves and the two of them stepped onto Instructor Zhou’s flying sword. Then the flying sword disappeared into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Duty Hall was located on Little Bell Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the flying sword closed in on Little Bell Peak, Zhao Jiuge saw more and more people entering or leaving this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of those people were disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. There were not only the blue, green, and orange robes of the three peaks, but also clothes of varying colors. It seemed that even inner sect disciples often came to the Duty Hall to get missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou’s flying sword circled a few times and then slowly landed on Little Bell Peak. The mountain peak was filled with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You go in yourself, the hall there is the Duty Hall. Remember to show the wooden token you got when you entered the sect. New disciples like you won’t be sent too far, and you won’t be able to take dangerous missions, but you still have to be careful. The outside world is not as safe as the sect, and even if the location is close to the sect, there might still be many accidents.” This time, the instructions were very serious. No matter how extraordinary the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was, they couldn’t ensure the safety of all disciples heading out. After all, a baby eagle must fly on their own one day. They couldn’t always hide under the shelter of the adult eagle. Only after experiencing the vast sky themselves could they truly soar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seriously explaining a few matters, Instructor Zhou looked worriedly at Zhao Jiuge. However, he flew off and didn’t say more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has to be said that when new disciples began taking missions, they would often go in groups. However, Zhao Jiuge was different from ordinary people, so Instructor Zhou had high expectations of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the more than 30 people he was teaching, Zhao Jiuge was the only good seedling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Instructor Zhou left, Zhao Jiuge didn’t rush to enter the hall. Instead, he looked up at this unfamiliar peak. He looked enviously at the people flying through the sky on flying swords or riding various mounts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After watching for a while, he felt his horizons broaden, but this was also a bit pointless. After all, it wasn’t him who was flying, and if he had time to watch others, he could use that time to earn sect contributions instead. This time, Zhao Jiuge didn’t think too much—he just walked toward the Duty Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Duty Hall was created to help train their disciples so they could hone their skills with real combat. There was nothing better to stimulate these disciples than treasures. The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was not like the other holy lands, where the elders would reward disciples with treasures and pills. Everything in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had to be earned on their own. This wasn’t that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had a weaker foundation. In fact, because of their founder, their foundation was stronger than everyone else’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inside of the hall was very lively. Aside from the black-robed instructors, there were also young disciples helping with giving out missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was stunned. This was his first time here, so he didn’t know what to do. He could only look around and see how others were accepting missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After watching for a while, Zhao Jiuge finally understood how it worked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black-robed instructors and black-robed youths were members of the Duty Hall. Disciples went directly to them. After hesitating a bit, Zhao Jiuge found a rather gentle-looking young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge lowered his head and respectfully said, “Hello, Senior Brother. I’m here to receive missions, but it's my first time here, so I’d like to ask how to receive missions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the gentle young man heard Zhao Jiuge’s question, he smiled faintly. “When you first entered the sect, you were given a wooden token, right? Take it out. Also, you should be one of the new disciples who have only been in the sect for one year. You don’t get to choose missions, you basically just take what we give you. This is because you’re still relatively weak, and it's for your own safety.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly nodded and quickly took out the wooden token. He was surprised that this wooden token still had this use. There were still 200 sect contributions recorded inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gentle young man took the wooden token and then picked up a white jade tube. Then he glanced at the wooden token. Zhao Jiuge’s name and all his information were clearly recorded there. He also saw there were already 200 sect contributions in there, which made the gentle young man look at Zhao Jiuge with a hint of shock.</span></p>

It seemed like this youth was undoubtedly one of the best among the new disciples.</span></p>

Then he waved his hand and a ray of white light shot out from the jade tube and entered the wooden token.</span></p>

Head to the largest family there to get more information. This mission was added recently. It seems like there is some kind of haunting going on there. As for the other matter, you will have to deal with it yourself. The details of the situation and the geographical location have been recorded in your wooden token.”</span></p>

When he picked up his first mission, he was like this too, and he later suffered a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at that figure like he was looking at his younger self.

I saw on your wooden token that you still have 200 sect contributions. Why not use those to buy some common treasures? Don’t think that 200 sect contributions is very little, it's still enough for some common treasures. Of course, you can’t afford anything good, but it's better than going out empty-handed,” the gentle young man patiently explained to Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge thought that this was reasonable and said, “But I don’t know where the Treasure Pavilion is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gentle young man didn’t lose his patience as he explained to Zhao Jiuge, “Just go and head toward the hall up there.”</span></p>

He looked back at the Duty Hall and thought about how many fierce individuals were inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One needed a certain amount of strength to become an instructor and elder; otherwise, don’t even think about it. It was said there were also old monsters in the sect that never came out.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire pavilion was black and was supported by eight black pillars. The pavilion was divided into five floors.</span></p>

How much manpower and resources were needed to create this system? Most missions were brought back by the Enforcement Hall, and those that were urgent were usually completed by the disciples in the Enforcement Hall. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the specific details and workflow, an outer disciple like Zhao Jiuge would not know.</span></p>

He had only been able to enter the first floor, yet there were already so many people. He wondered what the upper floors would be like. However, he believed that he would be able to reach there with his one strength one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge no longer hesitated and walked toward the Treasure Pavilion to buy some useful things before leaving. Then he suddenly remembered that the wine from Leng Rufeng was obtained from the Treasure Pavilion.</span></p>
