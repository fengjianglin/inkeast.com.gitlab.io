 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s actions were concise and vicious, and she didn’t hesitate at all. All the disciples watching this were stunned to see a woman being so overbearing. Each of them swallowed hard and looked at this beautiful and alluring woman. Normally, men would feel disgust toward this kind of woman, but when everyone looked at Bai Qingqing, they didn’t feel disgust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Mysterious Heaven Peak Square, everyone watched the scene unfold. When they heard Bai Qingqing’s final words, everyone burst out in cheers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Bai Qingqing could seize the opportunity brought by the twilight drum, how could Zhao Jiuge let this chance go? He was out of spirit force and had to rely on the Little Xuan Pill to recover bit by bit. He couldn’t even use the Sanskrit Divine Body, but even if he had just a little bit of spirit force, it was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge used the Twilight Drum, he didn’t retreat and instead charged toward Chen Jie’s group of five. At this moment, these five were the only ones remaining, and on the Mysterious Heaven Peak’s side, Leng Rufeng was the only one injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Zhao Jiuge rushed toward Chen Jie, he released his spirit force. The small amount of spirit force he had left rushed forward and instantly surrounded them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had just lost their focus and the spirit force inside their bodies had stopped moving for a moment. Therefore, they couldn’t resist this spirit force attack that looked weak but was strong enough to deal at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Jie and the two others in front were immediately surrounded by this spirit force. Crackling sounds echoed as their skin cracked and blood appeared. Not much blood flowed out before it was immediately frozen over with a thin layer of ice. Although they were at the Foundation Realm, they had made their breakthroughs late, so they hadn’t gotten to temper their bodies in a spirit vein yet. Once they were injured by the spirit force attack, their auras immediately dimmed. Only Chen Jie was able to remain standing with his mid stage Foundation Realm cultivation, but he was barely holding on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge had already arrived before him. Zhao Jiuge didn’t waste time speaking nonsense—he wrapped his palm in spirit force and punched Chen Jie in the face. Before, Zhao Jiuge wouldn't dare to do this, but most of his spirit force was gone, so the power of the punch wasn’t that strong. Chen Jie managed to react and his spirit force was showing signs of returning. The Twilight Drum’s effect only lasted for a very short period of time, but it had already drained all the spirit force Zhao Jiuge had recovered from the Little Xuan Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Jie quickly released his spirit force to block this blow. Factoring in his Foundation Realm body, he didn’t suffer much damage, but since Zhao Jiuge had taken the initiative, he would always be a step behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Zhao Jiuge’s punch turned into a palm and he quickly grabbed the collar of Chen Jie’s robe. Right now, Zhao Jiuge didn’t have much spirit force, so he turned it into a brawl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After grabbing Chen Jie’s collar, he planted his right knee on Chen Jie’s abdomen. Chen Jie had just recovered his breath, so his face immediately became distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let go of Chen Jie’s collar and his palm slammed into Chen Jie’s chest. He didn’t worry about his strength like when he punched Chen Jie’s face. He used all the power he had and surged what little spirit force he had recovered into his palm, causing it to shine brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Jie coughed out a mouthful of blood and his eyes were filled with hatred. His crazed aura had quickly wilted down. His chest was caved in from Zhao Jiuge’s palm, and not only were his bones damaged, even his meridians were damaged. He would need months to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was strange was that there wasn’t any blood flowing out. Chen Jie looked at Zhao Jiuge reluctantly. His body twitched a few times, but he could no longer move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Zhao Jiuge had lost his Blue Plum Sword and didn’t have much spirit force left, he could still deal with the disciples of the Mysterious Strange Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t even have time to relax when two rays of silver sword energy closed in. He felt a tingling pain on his skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tingling pain on his skin became more and more obvious, but this sensation soon disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then two rays of silver sword energy came from Bai Qingqing and accurately stopped those two attacks. The two rays of sword energy then exploded before the two Mysterious Strange Peak disciples’ chests, resulting in a bloody mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of cultivation levels, Bai Qingqing was a head above them. In terms of treasures, Bai Qingqing’s Wind Flower Sword was a spirit treasure. They had been focused on Zhao Jiuge and were immediately injured by those two rays of sharp sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had stopped those two rays of sword energy at the same time that Zhao Jiuge sent Chen Jie flying. He turned his head and kicked off with his right foot, using this force to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light around his body shined brightly again. It seemed like his spirit force was slowly increasing thanks to the Little Xuan Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge kicked off with his right leg, the golden light around him danced like a faint halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge closed in on the last two remaining Mysterious Strange Peak disciples, his hands turned into two palms. Chilly, white light surrounded his palms, and he aimed for their chests, which had just been injured by Bai Qingqing’s sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two miserable screams echoed across the top of Wu Hua Peak. Everyone who heard them felt a chill in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their chests were already bloody messes from the sword energy, and then they were each hit once more by Zhao Jiuge’s palms. Both of them trembled violently and lost their senses. They dropped to their knees and supported themselves with their arms. They could only see blurs of blood and flesh on the wounds on their chests. The surfaces of the wounds had frozen over with a thin layer of ice that had mixed in with their skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all 12 Foundation Realm cultivators from the Mysterious Strange Peak were defeated, all of them seriously injured. Although the injuries weren't life-threatening, they wouldn’t be able to do anything before the inner sect selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every disciple of the Mysterious Strange Peak had been beaten hard, and they were all suffering. Zhao Jiuge glanced at the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples who were either lying or kneeling on the ground. Each of them was extremely weak or their faces were distorted in pain. He silently muttered one thing in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leng Rufeng, big brother has gotten revenge for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge was not in a good state either. The right sleeve of his blue robe had been cut into pieces and his body was covered in blood. It was impossible to see the original blue of his robe, and some of his wounds were still bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bleeding was not obvious before, but Zhao Jiuge's large movements had opened the wounds even more. His mostly blue sword robe was now dark red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge felt very proud about having dealt with 12 people on the other side. He didn’t care much about his injuries because his core wasn’t damaged. The Sanskrit Divine Body was extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled and used his left sleeve to wipe away the blood from the corner of his mouth. The golden light around him flickered and his eyes were filled with pride. He loudly shouted, “Who else wants a go?”</span></p>
