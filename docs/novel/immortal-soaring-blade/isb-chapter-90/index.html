 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, Zhao Jiuge was knocked to the ground by the Chill Wood Ruler. The blood in his body was surging and his bones felt numb. He couldn’t even move, and didn’t even get a chance to use his ace. Fortunately, the youth with the scar was confident and had underestimated his enemy, which gave Zhao Jiuge a chance to recover. While he silently endured the beating from the youth with the scar, he was regaining control of the spirit force inside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking advantage of the youth with the scar’s carelessness, he could only act first. He pulled out a purple jade gourd that exuded a warm feeling—it was the Purple Gold Fire Gourd that he had taken from Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the gourd shined brightly and a cluster of orange true fire flew out, all under Zhao Jiuge’s control. It was like a roaring fire snake, and it was about to surround the youth with the scar with intense heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was originally just relying on the natural instinct of the Chill Wood Ruler to release some power, but now it was faintly being suppressed by the fire soaring in the sky. One was just relying on instinct, while the other was being actively controlled, so they couldn’t be compared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge, who was in an extremely sorry state, jump up again and holding a small gourd in his hands, everyone became excited. They knew that the situation on the platform was about to undergo a shocking reversal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the youth with the scar’s face froze from his triumphant expression. He cursed inwardly—he had been careless. How could he know that this brat was waiting for a chance? Although he cursed in his heart, he didn’t slow down. He manipulated his spirit force to flow into the Chill Wood Ruler, causing it to shine brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chill Wood second scroll!” The youth with the scar’s voice became anxious and his pupils shrank as he looked at the incoming flames. The flickering fire lit up his face as if it was showing his current mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his hurried words echoed, the temperature raised by the flames dropped once more. The originally clear sky suddenly lost color and became gloomy. The cold wind that blew like knives was mixed in with snow. If the two were not fighting, this scene would be somewhat beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bursts of cold wind surged to form a tornado, then it condensed into a cold dragon that violently charged into the incoming fire. When the Chill Wood Ruler released its shocking power, the flames in the sky had already dimmed. When they were hit by the cold dragon formed by the wind, they instantly dimmed and scattered, but they didn’t disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this situation, Zhao Jiuge could no longer hide. His face was grim and eyes opened in anger. His spirit force poured into the purple jade gourd in his hands to the point of it shaking. The orange fire that was torn apart began to slowly gather and was about to confront the wind and frost again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar sneered. He had just suffered a loss, so he didn’t give Zhao Jiuge a change. He injected more spirit force into the Chill Wood Ruler, making it release even more power. The cold dragon became even more clear and its eyes shined with power. Although it was made of spirit force, its power was not to be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, its claws violently stretched out and tore apart the orange fire that had just gathered until the scorching true fire disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar didn’t reveal a complacent look this time. The Chill Wood Ruler was no ordinary treasure. Due to his low cultivation level, it wasn’t that strong. A good treasure also depended on the person using it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You even took out that trash treasure to embarrass yourself.” Zhao Jiuge was able to come back due to his carelessness and made him embarrass himself. This time, he was not going to play any games—he was aiming to cripple. His dark eyes were filled with cruelty, and the pressure in the sky was about to rush violently toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cold wind howled and was as sharp as knives. Zhao Jiuge felt pain from this wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the dim Purple Gold True Fire Gourd, he helplessly let out a sigh. The only magic treasure he had seemed to be damaged and had become temporarily useless. The difference between their treasures was so great that even though the youth with the scar could only use less than 1/10 of the Chill Wood Ruler’s true power, it was enough to easily deal with his Purple Gold True Fire Gourd. Fortunately, Zhao Jiuge still had his true ace. The gourd was just there to buy him some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now he was finally ready!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind and frost surged before him, but Zhao Jiuge remained unmoved as it closed in on him. Instead, he erupted with an unyielding gaze. He was like a proud lone wolf; even after leaving the pack, he was still dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This proud lone wolf had encountered a peerless beast filled with hostility. Who was stronger and who was weaker?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mysterious hand seals were made before his chest. As the complicated seals appeared, ripples echoed in the air before him like water. His sluggish aura suddenly surged once more like a bud that was blooming again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sanskrit Heart Sutra quickly surged in his body, ignoring the depletion of his spirit force. The golden dragon inside his dantian had already opened its eyes and was ready to move. After being nourished by spirit force, the scales of the dragon had become even more clear and lifelike. However, instead of just one golden dragon, there were two!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two golden dragons coiled up, their sharp claws swaying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yesterday, Zhao jiuge remembered that after reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm, he could form his second golden dragon. He gave it a try and was able to condense it. This was why Zhao Jiuge had arrived late this morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he reached the Spirit Transformation Realm, he went into the big battle against the Xiao family. Then he was hunted and had to slaughter his way out to finally escape. Then he ran into a powerful enemy at the unmarked graveyard and met Su Su. Up until he came to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he never had the chance to cultivate this seriously, so it had been delayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was able to cultivate this last night by luck, and it was his final ace. Zhao Jiuge always looked calm before the youth with the scar was because of this. His confidence came from the Sanskrit Divine Body that he had always relied on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge’s aura reached a peak, the corners of his blue sword robe started fluttering. At this moment, everyone outside the stage was silent as they stared with their eyes wide open. They were afraid to breathe too hard, as if they would disturb the two people fighting. Who would have thought that two little fellows at the Spirit Transformation Realm who had just entered the sect could cause such a big commotion in a fight? The older disciples all felt ashamed. No matter who won or lost, their future was unlimited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the three instructors looked at each other, they all saw the shock in each other’s eyes. Even Wu Tianshan and the glamorous woman looked surprised at Zhao Jiuge’s actions. This kind of aura was not something a little fellow at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm could achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, two successive ripples spread across the Mysterious Heaven Peak. Accompanied by the roars of dragons, two golden dragons appeared in the sky, shocking everyone. The roars were filled with joy and excitement. The two golden dragons looked much stronger than the cold dragon formed by the wind and frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I can’t compete with you with treasures, but let me use this spell to break you.” Zhao Jiuge smiled with confidence on his face. The already-dried blood on the corner of his mouth was unusually dazzling. After Zhao Jiuge spoke, the two golden dragons in the sky moved. Not only could the Sanskrit Divine Body defend, it could also attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two golden dragons rushed into the sky, and after they reached a certain height, they coiled together. The ear-piercing dragon roars and the howl of the wind seemed to mix together like the music of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After doing all of this, the originally shining Zhao Jiuge endured intense pain. His face became flushed and all the spirit force in his body was exhausted. If this blow couldn’t defeat the youth with the scar, then he would have to concede to his fate. At that point, he would have no strength left and he would certainly lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the shocking attack, the youth with the scar was stunned, then he felt bitterness in his mouth. This hillbilly who he had always looked down upon had shocked him time and time again. This time, he felt a bit powerless. The Chill Wood Ruler was his ace in the hole, but now he could only wait to have a final confrontation with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a long breath and the last bit of fatigue disappeared from his face before being replaced by battle intent. He had been sent into the Barbarian Forest since he was a child; was he ever scared? When faced with difficulty and danger, when had his mind ever wavered?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chill Wood second scroll, Unrestrained Wind and Frost!” A roar with a decisive aura echoed. A surge of wind and frost even more violent than before filled the stage. This was the strongest attack the youth with the scar could use with the Chill Wood Ruler. This attack drained all his spirit force, making his face deathly pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge was no better than him. Both of them were relying on these last moves to decide the outcome of this battle. On the platform, the two of them stared at each other as wind and frost raged across the sky. The two of them coldly stared at each other as the wind and frost covered their vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the wind and frost were covering their vision, the passion of the crowd wasn’t affected. Finally, after a long time, the winner was going to be decided after this collision. The two attacks collided before everyone’s excited gazes.</span></p>
