 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

They two of them flew for a while and soon arrived at the entrance of Iron Mouth Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After one day, Iron Mouth Village was not different from before. Everything in the village was peaceful and quiet. Riding on his sword, Zhao Jiuge could see several women squatting down by the stream, washing clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when the two rays of light appeared above Iron Mouth Village, the women washing clothes immediately looked up at this strange scene. When they saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, their faces erupted with joy from the bottom of their hearts. This scene shocked Zhao Jiuge. They instantly dropped the clothes they were washing into the stream and rushed back to the village. They were wiping their hands on their dress and the wooden basins were just left there in the stream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After these women ran into the village, they began shouting around, and other villages quickly ran out. After some time, more and more people gathered. Some felt joy, while a few others felt complicated. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing had put away their flying swords and arrived at the entrance of the village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, hundreds of people gathered and the old village chief walked out. Beside him was Cai Na, and to his right was Big Bear. He was followed by the men, women, and children of the village. The crowd kept increasing, but the old village chief remained in front. There was no noise coming from the crowd. Instead, they looked curiously at the two extraordinary-looking youths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the old village chief saw Zhao Jiuge walk across the bridge with his sword in hand, he asked, “Was there any trouble?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he asked, he looked at the two youths. Once he determined that the two of them looked fine, the old village chief continued, “What happened to that piece of dog shit?” There was inquiry and anticipation on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he asked, Zhao Jiuge felt everyone hold their breath. At this moment, he felt like even if a needle dropped, it could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had a faint smile on his face. Just as he was about to speak, Bai Qingqing suddenly made a move. She opened the cloth in her hands and a round object rolled out before everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cries erupted from the crowd, they were mostly women and children. Accompanied by the screams were gazes filled with terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the men who saw the object, at most they sucked in breaths of cold air. It turned out that the round object was Han Songcheng’s head. His eyes were wide open from shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment of silence, a thunderous burst of joy and happiness erupted from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great, great, that piece of dog shit is finally dead. We’ll never have to be scared anymore! The villages of Yellow Flower Ridge will never be hurt again!” The old man’s left hand that was holding the cane trembled and he had a big smile on his wrinkled face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you!” Cai Nu shyly looked at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. On the side, Big Bear was also very happy, but he wasn’t very good with words. He had a big smile on his face and scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, the thing we promised you all is done. This piece of dog shit is dead, so you don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Zhao Jiuge said with a smile, but then he found that he didn’t know what to say while facing the crowd of people before him. He then said, “Okay, now that the matter is resolved, we need to head back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the noisy atmosphere became completely silent after Zhao Jiuge spoke. They all stared at the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two are going to leave like this? Why not stay for a few days so we can entertain you two?” The old man was startled. He didn’t expect Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing to leave so quickly after killing Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We understand your good intentions, but we still have things to do, so we must hurry.” Zhao Jiuge felt a bit overwhelmed by the old village chief’s enthusiasm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, a dozen kilometers away, on Fallen Leaf Mountain, the place is not empty. If you have time, you guys can go clean it up, there is a lot of stuff there.” After Zhao Jiuge finished speaking, he pulled Bai Qingqing and prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden light and a water-blue light appeared. The two of them had already stepped onto their respective flying swords. From beginning to end, Bai Qingqing didn’t speak. However, at the final moment, she looked back at the villagers of Iron Mouth Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the two were about to leave, the villagers behind the old village chief all knelt down. They felt sincere gratitude toward Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. Outsiders could not imagine how painful these times were and how terrible Han Songcheng’s reputation was. Now that this cancer had been dealt with, the villagers felt like they had obtained a new lease on life. After all, who didn’t have a wife or daughter in their home? They didn’t want much—as long as they could live together with their families in peace, it was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These villagers’ sincere actions had even moved Bai Qingqing. She hoped that there would be less evil in the world. The two of them sighed in their hearts and then left on their flying swords, leaving behind the villagers that continued to kneel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, this matter spread across more than a dozen villages in Yellow Flower Ridge. Some people gathered the courage and headed to Fallen Leaf Mountain. They found the blood and traces of battle, and they couldn’t help but admire the handsome young man and alluring young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterward, the villagers in the area used the things found at Fallen Leaf Mountain to hire a skilled painter and commissioned a painting based on the impressions of the villagers. Finally, they carved two statues to show their gratitude and so the future generations would forever remember it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, who had returned to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, didn’t know. Since they killed Han Songcheng, this trip to Yellow Flower Ridge was over. The two of them took three days to return to the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After returning to the sect, Bai Qingqing, who still had something on her mind, immediately split from Zhao Jiuge. Before she left, she told Zhao Jiuge to pick up the mission to kill the spirit beast. Then cultivate for a while before going out on that mission. She wanted him to pick it up now to prevent someone else from taking it. They were not far from the inner sect selection, so after cultivating for a bit, this would likely be the last mission they would do as new disciples of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Bai Qingqing now had more than 500 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone, Zhao Jiuge was more interested in creating his own defensive treasure. After returning to the sect, he quickly bade farewell to Bai Qingqing. He didn’t go to the Duty Hall to collect his sect contributions, nor did he go buy materials at the Treasure Pavilion. Instead, he rushed to the Sword Casting Hall that he hadn’t gone to before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Casting Hall was located on Sword Casting Peak. Although it was called the Sword Casting Hall, it could also forge other treasures as well. It was called the Sword Casting Hall simply because the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect focused on swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sword Casting Hall was not like the Duty Hall and the Treasure Pavilion, which were located on the surface. On the contrary, the Sword Casting Hall was located at the bottom of the mountain. He landed on Sword Casting Peak and then eagerly ran toward the entrance of the Sword Casting Hall. His eyes were burning with passion and he constantly looked around. This was the first time he had come to the legendary Sword Casting Hall, and it was inevitable that he would come here often in the future. His heart fluttered just thinking about forging his first flying sword. However, before that, he had to refine a defensive treasure; otherwise, he would always suffer in terms of defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the way back, Zhao Jiuge had gained an understanding of how precious Purple Ji Spirit Stone was from Bai Qingqing, which made him even more ecstatic. He had a special love for treasures, and the more powerful the treasure, the better. Thinking about how precious and scarce Purple Ji Spirit Stone was, Zhao Jiuge had even more expectation toward the defensive treasure he was going to refine.</span></p>

Sword Casting Peak was different from the other peaks. The peak of the mountain was left in its natural state. The entrance was a cave hidden on the side of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking many turns, Zhao Jiuge walked along a rocky cliff. His eyes lit up when he saw a cliff with several youths wearing the Enforcement Hall uniform. Zhao Jiuge knew that this was the entrance. He smiled and walked toward it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop. What are you here for?” a youth wearing the Enforcement Hall uniform shouted because Zhao Jiuge was wearing ordinary clothes and was unfamiliar. His brows furrowed and he was secretly on guard while staring at Zhao Jiuge’s every moment. The three people next to him were also prepared to act. Although the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was very secure, there were people guarding all the important locations just in case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I came to refine a treasure,” Zhao Jiuge calmly replied. He quickly took out the wooden token that represented his identity and handed it to the youth that had walked forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth took the wooden token and carefully looked at it. After determining there was no problem with the wooden token, he returned it to Zhao Jiuge and said, “Go inside.” After confirming Zhao Jiuge’s identity, the young man filled with bloodlust’s voice softened. He turned to the side and made way for Zhao Jiuge to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge put the wooden token away, then he nodded and walked into the cave under the cliff. The Sword Casting Hall was at the bottom of the mountain, so he had to go through the mountain. It was similar to the Purple Ji Spirit Stone mine under Fallen Leaf Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason the Sword Casting Hall was built underground was not to hide it, but because refining treasures required fire. There were more than a dozen Earth Heart Fires of various sizes under Sword Casting Peak. In order to utilize the Earth Heart Fire to help refine treasures, the Sword Casting Hall was built underground. Borrowing the power of the Earth Heart Fire, not only would the success rate go up, but the quality of the treasure would increase too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had their own unique way of refining. Most flying swords and treasures the disciples used came from the sect. The disciples worked hard to earn sect contributions and buy resources. The sect used this method to encourage disciples to work hard and cultivate powerful cultivators. The idea was that the sect would become stronger because it had stronger disciples, and this would allow them to obtain even more treasures and resources. This cycle needed to continue for years before a holy land could be born. However, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had shown signs of weakening.</span></p>
