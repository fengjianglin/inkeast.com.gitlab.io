 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long’s short, black sword rotated a few times in his palm and then he slashed down with a ferocious light in his eyes. His spirit force wrapped around his sword and his slash collided with the sword energy. There was a flash of light, then Zhang Long only felt his head ring, his arm go numb, and a sweet taste in his mouth. He couldn’t help but be forced back a few steps. At the same time, Fat Dragon and Cheng Jianqian finally followed up from the left and right. They were like his left and right arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon’s leg bent slightly and he was ready to exert force from his hands. Seeing the two rays of sword energy close in, he raised the golden blade in his hand and aimed at one of the rays of sword energy. He then chopped with all his might to the point that the fat on his cheeks was shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the two made contact, Fat Dragon couldn’t help but retreat and clench his teeth. Fat Dragon ignored the pain of his muscles being torn and let out a roar. He kicked his right foot back to stop himself from being pushed back! Unlike Zhang Long, who was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, Fat Dragon was only at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, so he suffered more pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another ray of sword energy left, and Cheng Jianqian charged up to greet it. Cheng Jianqian held a dagger in his hand and slashed at the sword energy. The collision created a shock wave that directly sent Cheng Jianqian flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle had just begun, but the three of them had received various degrees of injuries. The difference between the Foundation Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm was large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long was filled with anger and let out a hysterical shout. “Quickly, use the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram like we practiced.” At this moment, he had to use the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram, which contained eight different forms of sword art. From Han Songcheng’s understanding, it should be made for eight people. When practicing, he unexpectedly found that the spirit force could superimpose, and when the eight of them used it, their spirit force could multiply by several folds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long didn’t have to say more after that roar. The four people who rushed ahead had already arrived on the left and right. Zhang Long had recovered from the numbness from blocking the hit. The man at the early stage of the Spirit Formation Realm who hadn’t acted yet accompanied Zhang Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from Cheng Jianqing, who had been sent flying, even Fat Dragon walked forward and got into position. The seven of them vaguely formed a large half-circle to surround Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. Zhao Jiuge was ready to make a move but stopped. He was curious about what they wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was somewhat surprised, so he asked Bai Qingqing, “Could it be another formation?” His grip on the Blue Plum Sword did not loosen. He was on guard just in case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing frowned and carefully observed the party’s stances, movements, and actions. There was doubt in her eyes because it was very similar to a formation but also wasn’t. She removed those thoughts from her head. Since she couldn’t figure it out, there was no need to think about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then she shouted, “Attack!” The Wind Flower Sword in her hand shined again. It didn’t matter if it was formation or not. In the end, strength would win. The injured Cheng Jianqian quickly got into his position in the formation. Victory or defeat would be decided in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing shouted, Zhao Jiuge moved as well, but Zhang Long moved even faster because he hadn’t stopped moving. When Zhao Jiuge raised his sword to attack, Zhang Long was already within three steps of him. Zhang Long kicked off with one foot and was ready to cut down with the short sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long’s actions forced Zhao Jiuge to give up his attack and defend instead. He slanted his sword to block. This time, Zhao Jiuge didn’t feel the sharpness of the attack. It felt like an illusion, like his sword had collided with an indestructible object. Zhang Long succeeded in his plan and used the collision to retreat. Just as Zhao Jiuge was recovering to strike again, Fat Dragon followed up with a powerful chop that gave Zhao Jiuge no time to react. Helpless, Zhao Jiuge could only block again and had no chance to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It's like fighting someone as strong as an ox while you were trapped in a place where you couldn’t even lift your arms or exert any strength. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt this sense of helplessness. Bai Qingqing was facing the same thing—she had strength but couldn’t use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While blocking the other party’s attacks, Bai Qingqing was thinking about what kind of formation this was. It was very similar to a formation, but something was not right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit force fluctuations were centered around them, and the eight people attacked in waves. One attack was stronger than the last, allowing only a few Spirit Transformation Realm and Blood Movement Realm cultivators to suppress her and Zhao Jiuge like this. If this dragged on, Han Songcheng and Vulture would have time to recover, and things would go really badly for them. If not for the spirit treasure in Bai Qingqing’s hand, their power would be equal to hers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of formation is this!?” Zhao Jiuge was filled with anger and anxiously roared. He thought Zhang Long and company were using something like a formation the people from the Xiao family had used when he was being hunted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking advantage of this situation, Zhang Long let out a cold snort and contemptuously said, “You think I’ll tell you my ace? Dream on!” After he spoke, his empty left hand subconsciously touched his chest. This action, however, was caught by Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhang Long felt a burst of joy. All the depression and resentment he had been feeling disappeared. The situation was slowly turning in their favor and was being controlled by them. Zhang Long thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Eight Desolate Sword Diagram is indeed powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing, who had been silent this whole time, suddenly shouted and startled Zhao Jiuge. “Jiuge, quick, we’ll attack the weakest one together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, Bai Qingqing was just blocking attacks, but she hadn't been idle. The strange behavior of the group seemed like a formation, but it wasn’t. Bai Qingqing found it familiar, and this caused her some headache. She had been educated since young, so her horizons were a lot wider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, learning too many things made it so she couldn’t exactly remember what it was or how to break it. Zhao Jiuge’s angry shout just now had made her realize that whether it was a formation or not didn’t matter. Since it was similar, she was going to break through this strange siege with the same method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like how she needed to find the formation eye to break the formation, Bai Qingqing chose the weakest among them. That would be like the formation eye, and the rest would just be like the remaining formation flags—unable to do anything without the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s shout, Zhao Jiuge awakened and realized Bai Qingqing’s intention. Zhao Jiuge wasn’t the only one who awakened. Hearing Bai Qingqing’s shout, Zhang Long cursed in his heart. He had control of the sword diagram, so he understood its characteristics and weaknesses best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhang Long first obtained the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram, he couldn’t grasp it at all. He had to rely on his own comprehension to slowly understand it. He didn’t know if this was the intended method, but his understanding was limited. Han Songcheng and he had never seen a sword diagram like this before. When he found that the eight of them could superimpose their spirit force, Zhang Long was a bit proud of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the biggest drawback was that once the rhythm was disrupted, this superimposing spirit force effect would no longer exist. If one of them were missing, then the remaining seven wouldn’t be able to display the power of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram. When he heard Bai Qingqing’s words, Zhang Long’s heart became anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge immediately glanced at the burly man in green to the right. This man was at the mid stage of the Blood Movement Realm and was the weakest among the eight. After he was sent staggering back after a collision with Bai Qingqing, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes turned cold. The Blue Plum Sword in his hand trembled and he sent out a few rays of sword energy that instantly surrounded the man in green.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahahaha…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miserable cry came from the man in green, and the next moment, blood sprayed everywhere. Blood dyed his clothes red, and before his eyes could close, his body was already on the ground.</span></p>

This was the second time he had killed someone, but compared to the first time, he was not bothered. He didn’t feel nervous at all, but a sense of joy. When it came to these evil scum, only by removing them could people enjoy peace.</span></p>

A brother that had accompanied him for so many years had died just like that. However, this was no time to grief, because at this moment, they were missing a person. The advantageous situation they were in no longer existed, and an even bigger crisis was coming.</span></p>

The two sides were in melee combat, so it was a contest of pure spirit force. &nbsp;At this moment, Zhang Long and company’s weakness was becoming obvious.</span></p>

Blood was still flowing out and the flesh was peeling back toward both sides.</span></p>

As a female herself, she understood how much those girls had suffered under these pieces of dog shit. Bai Qingqing felt that killing them was letting them off easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words filled with killing intent, Zhao Jiuge felt his scalp go numb, but he still listened to her.</span></p>
