 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked up at the door and saw the happy Luo Xie return. When Zhao Jiuge was looking at him, Luo Xie also saw Zhao Jiuge sitting on the bed. The smile on his face instantly magnified countless fold and he quickly rushed up to Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiuge, you came back. Your performance today was so good. You didn’t see the faces of the people in the audience, it was so enjoyable. I didn’t expect you to be so powerful. Even I admire you.” Luo Xie opened his mouth and chattered endlessly. It was as if he had endless things to talk about. Looking at how excited he was, you would think he was the person who had won the fight today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drops of saliva flew through the air, and Zhao Jiuge felt helpless. Just as he wanted to cultivate and recover, Luo Xie had come back. Although Luo Xie’s usual smile was a bit evil, after being with him for a while, Zhao Jiuge knew that he was a chatterbox. Once he started talking, he would go on endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge could only let out a weak smile. The pain in his body and the tiredness of his mind made him not want to waste any energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Xie seemed to be in high spirits and spoke with joy. When he saw Luo Xie’s excitement, Zhao Jiuge could only endure his eagerness to cultivate and heal and patiently listen to Luo Xie talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was not in high spirits and only responded with a sound or a slight nod, Luo Xie closed his mouth. He looked timidly at Zhao Jiuge and let out an awkward smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge also felt awkward, but it was not good to pour cold water on Luo Xie. He opened his mouth and asked, “Where did you go just now? I didn’t see you after the fight.” After he finished speaking, he seemed to agitate one of his injuries. The pain caused his brows to furrow, but he did his best to endure so Luo Xie wouldn’t notice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finally hearing Zhao Jiuge speak, Luo Xie’s originally dim expression became excited again. He quickly said, “Jiuge, after the fight, I went for a walk around the peak with like-minded friends I met during the fight. You don’t know how much those people admire you. Even Leng Rufeng was there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Luo Xie spoke, he had a mysterious expression. When talking about Leng Rufeng, his expression became even more extreme. “Also, some people want to meet you and become friends when there is time. Also, Leng Rufeng personally asked me to pass on a message to you. He wants to talk to you next month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the name “Leng Rufeng,” he was startled. Then he remembered that person who also won Spirit Tempering Pills. The person that was restrained and not arrogant. At the time, he wanted to find a chance to meet this person. Thinking about it now, his desire to talk with Leng Rufeng increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the people that had gone out together with Luo Xie, Zhao Jiuge had a good guess as to who they were. They were all youths who had similar families, because all the youths from good families had left together. They relied on their good family backgrounds and acted extremely arrogantly. They looked at the disciples from poor families like dogs, and the hostility was long there. After his speech, the whole matter was now public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a sigh in his heart. He just wanted to cultivate in peace, why did some many people want to find trouble with him? He couldn’t even cultivate in peace. However, no one could stop him from becoming stronger. Three years from now, he had to enter the inner sect. At that point, he would reach the sky with one step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiuge, what you said on the stage today was simply too domineering. You spend most of your time cultivating, so you don’t know a lot of things. The disciples from the good families have always bullied us, and several of us have even been beaten, so your performance today was really satisfying for us. I wish youth could have beaten up that youth with the scar a bit more.” There was hatred in Luo Xie’s eyes and his teeth were clenched. Zhao Jiuge felt helpless but also felt like Luo Xie looked a bit funny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt a little dizzy and almost couldn’t endure anymore. His voice was hoarse and weak as he whispered, “Okay, you should not always spend your time playing around. Cultivate more. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t even entered the inner sect yet. Everything will be different once you enter the inner sect. Only then will you be a carp that transforms into a dragon. I’ll meet Leng Rufeng and take a look at those new friends you made. Okay, I have to cultivate to heal my injuries. Although I won today, it was a pyrrhic victory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Luo Xie nodded. He looked at Zhao Jiuge’s injuries with concern before returning to his wooden bed. He watched Zhao Jiuge as he cultivated. He was worried that something might happen to Zhao Jiuge and he couldn’t react in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were slightly closed and his head felt dizzy, so he quickly began to cultivate. As usual, the spiritual energy in the Mysterious Heaven Peak continued to pour into Zhao Jiuge’s body. Time slowly passed, and the Moonlight Dew’s effect was in full force now. Although the spiritual energy poured into his body could not be seen with the naked eye, Zhao Jiuge could feel that it was much faster than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This speed was enough to stun people before the Foundation Realm. After reaching the Foundation Realm and condensing a foundation formation, the spiritual energy absorbed automatically was already comparable to someone cultivating diligently every day. This was why heavenly treasures were less effective when your cultivation level was higher, and if they were used too much, they would lose their effect. Zhao Jiuge didn’t pay much attention to any of this. He always thought that as long has steadily moved forward, the day he hoped for would arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the spiritual energy turned into spirit force in his meridians, his body was like a dried-up rice field absorbing the sudden rain. Even the pain in his meridians and internal organs eased a bit. The tingling sensation made Zhao Jiuge let out a subconscious groan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body had suffered varying degrees of injuries, but none of them were serious. After cultivating the Sanskrit Divine Body, he was like an unkillable little cockroach. He just needed a period of time to recover. This was what was so domineering about the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After looking at the two golden dragons coiled up in his dantian, he felt warmth. This was not the first time these golden dragons had helped him. According to the Sanskrit Divine Body, when he reached the peak, not only would he have nine golden dragons, his body would change too. Perhaps his cultivation was still too shallow, because apart from the golden light that he released around his body, he hadn’t found anything else that was special about his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge was looking forward to cultivating the third golden dragon and what the next phenomenon would be like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his cultivation became stable, Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the injuries didn’t affect his roots. The youth with the scar was indeed strong. Not only did he have a deep understanding of the sword art, but his background was indeed strong. No wonder those disciples from big families looked down upon someone who came from a mountain village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual energy that violently surged into his body was transformed into spirit force and filled every part of his body. Zhao Jiuge noticed that after each battle, as long as he cultivated while injured, his cultivation would improve extremely fast. The color of his spirit force became bright and brighter. It hadn’t been long since he reached the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm. With the help of the Spirit Tempering Pill and the battle, Zhao Jiuge was surprised to find that his cultivation was showing faint signs of breaking through. This discovery made him very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had defeated the youth with the scar, who was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, while he was only at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, the gap in spirit force was obvious. No matter what methods he had, spirit force was fundamental. Without spirit force, heaven-defying spells and mysterious treasures couldn’t be used. Zhao Jiuge’s goals for these next three years were to reach the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm as soon as possible and begin to accumulate spirit force. Then he would comprehend the sword energy to the level of Elucidation. Then he would condense his foundation formation and breakthrough to the Foundation Realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he would utilize a spirit vein in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect to temper his spirit force with an attribute. Then he would successfully enter the inner sect in the exam. These were the goals Zhao Jiuge had set for himself. When he thought about the inner sect, his heart began to burn with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The road must be walked step by step. The meal must be eaten one bite at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With longing and expectation in his heart, Zhao Jiuge completely immersed himself in cultivation and threw aside all distractions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the courtyard of the room Zhao Jiuge lived in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A youth with a thin build and a black piece of cloth tying his hair together was holding a wooden sword in his hand. He constantly waved the sword, and the sword light flickered, creating afterimages. It was as beautiful as a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Zhao Jiuge, who had recovered. It had almost been a month since the fight. Not only had his injuries completely recovered, but his cultivation had become even more refined. It was a gift from the youth with the scar. Without that fight, it would have taken him several months of painstaking cultivation to reach this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the courtyard, Zhao Jiuge continued to practice the Sword Energy Elucidation. He either practiced it or studied it every day. His sword energy had increased to the size of his wrist, but there was still a big gap to Elucidation. However, Zhao Jiuge was not discouraged. Every day, after he cultivated for a while, he would come to the courtyard to practice the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge held the wooden sword and moved around like a dancing dragon coming out of the sea, and sometimes he danced around like the wind. Suddenly, a powerful sword intent appeared and a ray of silver light created a howl of wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A loud sound echoed and the dirt on the ground erupted. A pit more than three meters deep appeared on the ground, and the dirt that had flown into the air fell to the ground. This strike was profound, and even Zhao Jiuge was shocked by this. During this month, it was the first time his sword had reached such power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t understand what had happened to him, but at that moment, there was a flash of light. The first chapter repeatedly appeared in his head until he comprehended a proud and mysterious feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That strike was not only powerful, it was also not as flashy as before. Although it looked ordinary, it contained sword intent. When the sword swung, it felt like it was floating, plain yet melodious. It was like a lone boat drifting in the vast ocean. A ray of silver sword light the size of his wrist shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That feeling was profound and mysterious—he didn’t know how to express it in words. However, he was ecstatic because he had a faint feeling he had touched the domain of Elucidation. Although it was still far away, he had found the right direction. As long as the direction was right and he persisted in that direction, he would be able to touch the domain.</span></p>

Zhao Jiuge’s sword domain had reached an incredible depth and he had finally condensed a profound sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sword had touched the mystery.</span></p>
