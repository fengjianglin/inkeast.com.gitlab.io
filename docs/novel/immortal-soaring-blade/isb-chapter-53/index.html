 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chain of Immortal Dao Seeking? Those four words echoed in Zhao Jiuge’s heart, and he frowned. He wrinkled his nose as he looked at the chain before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chain softly rattled in the cold wind. The sound washed through everyone’s hearts like a life-threatening song.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a moment, no one spoke. They stared at each other dumbfoundedly, unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, an extremely arrogant voice broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go first, all of you watch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-robed Bai Zimo waved his hand and walked toward the edge of the cliff. His eyes were locked on to the chain and the corner of his mouth was curved up with his habitual look of sneer and disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, although his handsome and tender face contained a sense of gloominess that didn’t match his age, his luxurious and gentle temperament gave him quite the aura. The cold wind blew on his robe and his long hair fluttered. On this cold cliff, his figure seems somewhat warm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the young girls were smitten. Their frightened and confused faces began to shine as they looked at Bai Zimo with bright smiles. Zhao Jiuge felt helpless as he looked at these girls staring at Bai Zimo. Even some of the boys were affected by Bai Zimo’s actions and felt their blood boiling. They looked toward Bai Zimo in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought in his heart that Bai Zimo liked to stand out, but Bai Zimo was qualified to show off like this. He was also looking forward to what secret the chain held. After all, seeing someone else test the waters first would give everyone else some information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the change in the atmosphere among the people on the cliff, he felt proud, but he didn’t show anything on his face. After seeing that he had successfully pulled everyone’s attention, he was even more energetic and took one step onto the chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After one step, the already-shaking chain began to shake even more. Bai Zimo only tentatively took the first step, and because he wasn’t used to it, his whole body tilted forward. This caused everyone who was focused on him to let out a cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl’s expressions changed color and they covered their eyes, not daring to look. Even Bai Zimo was covered in cold sweat from the scare because he wasn’t prepared. It has to be said that the cliff was very tall, so if he didn’t die from the fall, all his bones would be broken. Even being at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm wouldn’t help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo stabilized his mind, swallowed, and his whole body tightened as he cycled his spirit force. He once again stepped on the chain, and this time his foot landed solidly. Although the chain was only as wide as a fist, it felt very sturdy when he stepped on it. However, he still felt a floaty feeling, but with all the gazes behind him, he could not back down. He no longer thought about it anymore—he hardened himself and his other foot stepped onto the chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chain was like a swing that swung side to side. Even with his spirit force cycling through his body, it was still not a good feeling. He looked down at his feet and saw the darkness below him. There was only thin, cold, white fog flowing through the darkness like a thin vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he could not see what was below, even a fool would know the consequences of falling. Bai Zimo could no longer pretend. He stretched out his arms to maintain his balance as he walked forward step by step as if he was walking on thin ice. After all, he had already said those cool words to catch everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, Bai Zimo’s figure gradually became smaller until he was engulfed by the night and completely disappeared. No one knew what it was like where he was or what kind of environment he was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the gazes that were gathered on Bai Zimo scattered after he disappeared. They all looked at each other and everyone was silent. No one wanted to be the second person to take the lead. After all, everyone was afraid of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the void on the mountainside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few powerful sword lights and dozens of spirit force fluctuations were quietly floating in the air. Not a trace of their presence was revealed. The three in front were the three black-robed instructors, and behind them were the disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, not even as good as the previous generations. If they don’t even have the courage to take the first step, how can they hope to walk far on the long road of cultivation? What qualifications do they have to become the powerhouses of their generation and stand by my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect?” These two questions showed Instructor Zhou’s inner thoughts. The situation on the cliff was entirely under their control. They hadn’t actually left, they just quickly turned around and waited below the cliff. This was so if any youth participating in the trial fell, they could quickly save them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even someone as strong as Instructor Zhou could do nothing as he faced the fall of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. He could only helplessly sigh in his heart. After all, just having a few strong people did make a sect strong, they needed many strong people. A sect not only needed those cultivators at the top, but a large amount of lower and middle-ranked cultivators to support it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. After all, they are still young and need to be taught slowly. Excellent disciples not only need talent and teaching, but also time and perseverance.” Instructor Li comforted Instructor Zhou, who was shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he also knew the situation of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Although he looked calm on the surface, he also felt bitterness in his heart. Facing the fact that there was a lack of successors, he could only feel helpless and reluctant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Bai Zimo, no one else went up. A young man with a red face actually stood out due to either a moment of hotheadedness or something else. He formed a stark contrast against the crowd, and everyone’s gazes gathered on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Either because he was nervous or because everyone was staring at him, his already-stiff body began to jitter unnaturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll give it a try. What a bunch of cowards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was still scared, he pretended like he was filled with disdain for the crowd. Seeing how those young girls were looking at him, he thought about how glorious Bai Zimo looked and couldn’t help but yearn to do the same. At this moment, he walked up to the metal chain with his chest puffed out and didn’t hesitate to step on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first it was shaking, but he steadily progressed step by step. However, it was unknown if he was excited or afraid, but soon, all kinds of nonsense appeared in his mind. He lost focus and actually missed a step and fell down the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AHHHHHHHHHH!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A miserable cry echoed deep in the night, stimulating the hearts of everyone on the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth’s frightened expressions were still deeply imprinted in everyone’s minds. His eyes were opened wide from fear. Just thinking about him falling off caused everyone to shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth continued to fall. The moment he started falling, Instructor Li had already moved. There was a ray of light, and in the blink of an eye, he caught the falling youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those timid girls all began to tremble. Zhao Jiuge originally thought that everyone was going to fall into silence for a long period of time, but a girl suddenly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was wearing a short top that revealed her belly button and hot pants that exposed a pair of white thighs that were slender and filled with temptation. Her long hair was lazily scattered behind her shoulders and she was wearing red from head to toe. She was extremely charming. It was the young girl that had entered the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t say any shocking words, nor did she do anything abnormal—she casually walked onto the chain, twisting her alluring waist as she disappeared into the night. Zhao Jiuge was tongue tied. What a terrifying girl. Outsiders may only see her friendly smile, but Zhao Jiuge found that the eyes on that charming face were extremely cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another person successfully stepped into the night, dispelling the fear the crowd had from the youth that had fallen off the cliff. On top of that, it was such a charming and beautiful girl. Some of the more hot-blooded youths could no longer help themselves. One does not fear that no one will lead, they fear that someone will take the lead. Someone let out a roar and a lot of people followed suit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Worst case, we die! If you’re a man, let’s go!” A young man wearing hemp clothes rolled up his sleeves. He puffed his chest and took the lead toward the chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. If we want to cultivate and can’t even take the first step, there is no need to talk about the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I just go back like this, I’ll lose all face if I don’t even see the sect. If even a girl dares, what is there to be scared of?”</span></p>
