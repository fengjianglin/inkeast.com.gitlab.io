 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a slight noise Zhao Jiuge steadily landed on the platform, letting out a sigh of relief. Then he looked up at the startled Bai Qingqing and softly comforted her, “See, just like I said, it's no problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also sent a friendly smile toward Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s chest was heaving violently. The jump from Zhao Jiuge had scared her to death, and she felt relief when she saw that he was fine. Then anger surged and she scolded, “Do you care about sect contributions that much!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing Bai Qingqing's anger, Zhao Jiuge only calmly looked at her and remained silent. Although he knew she was only worried about him as a friend, he really needed those sect contributions. At the same time, he was eager to improve his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, he didn’t know why Bai Qingqing’s words felt so harsh to him. Perhaps it was Zhao Jiuge’s own self-esteem at work. Since childhood, he had always been more sensible than his peers because of the helpless situation of his life. When other children were still playing and getting spoiled by their parents, he was already doing housework. He followed the old man into the mountains to hunt and collect herbs to trade for some meager savings so they could live. When faced with Bai Qingqing’s question, Zhao Jiuge chose to remain silent. Sometimes, the more he explained, the worse it became, so he would let his actions speak for him. He would use his actions to tell everyone in the world that one day, he would stand proudly under the sky of the Huaxia Dynasty and his name would echo across the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a complicated look on his face as he turned his head. He no longer looked at Bai Qingqing but stared at the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus sway in the mountain breeze. The small lotus and grown in such a harsh environment—when would he be able to stand out on the path to immortality?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking a deep breath, his entire body became tense and his breathing became slow. He adjusted his posture before he began moving toward the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus to pick it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slight movement of his feet caused some small pebbles to fall down the cliff. Zhao Jiuge swallowed hard and glanced at the bottom with his pale face. The cliff was so tall, he couldn’t really see the bottom. At this height, his body would definitely shatter if he fell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was only a 15-year-old boy—it was impossible for him to not be scared while standing on the cliff. Zhao Jiuge felt his legs tremble and his breathing became rapid. The wind made him feel a chill and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiuge, come back. This isn’t the only Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, there are other places to find it. I’ll help you find more, it's no big deal. I’ll even help you earn some sect contributions later,” Bai Qingqing said with an anxious expression after seeing Zhao Jiuge stop. She was like an anxious ant on a hot stove, but she didn’t dare to make any sudden movements, in fear of causing Zhao Jiuge to accidentally fall off the cliff. With her temper, she never had to be so patient and care for someone else before, but Zhao Jiuge ignored her and had a determined look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s persuasion didn’t get a response from Zhao Jiuge. After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, his originally shaky heart became firm. He had working legs and hands—as long as he worked hard, he could get what he wanted. Why should he rely on someone else’s charity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge entered a focused state. The wind and everything else were no longer important. There was only one thought in his heart: picking the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus. His dark eyes carefully surveyed the short path and calculated where he would step. Finally, after a while, he held his breath and moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to obtain the lotus, Zhao Jiuge even used his spirit force to increase his speed. He was afraid an accident would happen. With a flash of golden light, he quickly crossed the distance in a few breaths. Zhao Jiuge arrived next to the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, and his eyes were filled with passion as he looked at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind here was even more unscrupulous, causing Zhao Jiuge’s robes and hair to flutter. He moved without hesitation and quickly grabbed the lotus. He finally revealed a smile like a child who had just obtained a new toy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp sound echoed. The thin rock could no longer support Zhao Jiuge, and dense cracks appeared under his feet. Bai Qingqing let out a scream. Zhao Jiuge kicked off vigorously with his right leg and jumped off. The next second, the rock fell off the mountain, and only after a long time was a sound heard. Even in this quiet environment, the sound was almost inaudible. Zhao Jiuge felt lingering fear, but, fortunately, he had reacted quickly. If he had been a bit slower, he would have ended up at the bottom of the cliff like that rock and be shattered into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shivered and no longer dared to stick around this place. He quickly climbed back up in a few steps. When he reached safety, Zhao Jiuge felt relief wash over his body and was breathing rapidly. His breathing was like the bellow at a blacksmith shop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when he saw the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, he felt like it was all worth it. How could there be any gains if he wasn’t willing to take any risks? However, before he could allow himself a moment to breathe and be happy, he felt a tearing pain in his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You dare to completely ignore this old lady’s words, right? I see that you’re someone who shines if given a bit of sunlight, and if I give you a bit of color, you can open a dye shop. This old lady was here all along, worrying about you! You anger me to death!” After she saw Zhao Jiuge safely return from picking the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, her rich young lady temper completely erupted. She had her left hand on her waist and her right hand was holding Zhao Jiuge’s ear. She stared at him with a fierce expression as she shouted in his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge immediately grimaced in pain and shouted, “Ouch, let go. It hurts, it really hurts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, if I don’t teach you a lesson, you won’t remember.” Although she didn’t stop speaking, her hand holding Zhao Jiuge’s ear loosened a bit. Her exquisite face had an angry expression and her eyes were fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling Bai Qingqing let go of his ear, he said like his mouth was covered in honey, “I won’t dare to do it next time.” He knew Bai Qingqing’s personality, so he simply played along with her; otherwise, they would argue for a long time. Anyways, he already had the lotus in hand. It hadn’t been long and they had already found two herbs, which made Zhao Jiuge feel very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge began to laugh. “This Seven-Leaf Green Jade lotus exudes a delicate fragrance. Now we have two herbs. Let's continue looking elsewhere. I’m more and more confident in earning those sect contributions.” After he finished speaking, he deliberately raised the Seven-Leaf Green Jade in his right hand before Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing angrily rolled her eyes. “Put it away, this old lady is in a bad mood!” She stared fiercely at Zhao Jiuge and turned to walk in the other direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, Big Sister Qingqing, why are you angry? Didn’t you say you were going to help me get first place and give me the 100 sect contributions? Why has my lovable and charming Big Sister Qingqing gone?” Zhao Jiuger quickly chased after Bai Qingqing as he flattered her. He purposely had a flattering expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the mountain village, he had experienced a lot along the way and had met many friends at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. He had come into contact with more people, which had revealed his inner heart. The introverted Zhao Jiuge had slowly changed with the environment, and now he could even joke and tease. The temperament of a young man slowly revealed itself. Before, he was a little indifferent because he didn’t know how to face the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing, who was walking ahead, feeling a bit gloomy, suddenly laughed and could no longer feel angry. Seeing that he had finally managed to make Bai Qingqing laugh, he also smiled. Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s expression, she wanted to continue being angry, but she found that she was unable to hold back her laughter. She bent over and thoroughly laughed for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as she was about to speak, an eccentric voice broke this harmonious atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, a man and a woman alone in the mountains. You two look so happy, I’m so envious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s expressions changed at the same time. While they were laughing earlier, they hadn’t noticed anyone approaching them. They saw an arrogant teenager and a slender teenager walking toward them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrogant youth was Bai Zimo. He was wearing the same blue sword robe and had the wooden sword on his back. His handsome face had a malicious smile and his brows sometimes furrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had some impression of the other person. It was one of the few figures that had erupted along with the youth with the scar back on the stairs. He seemed to have remembered hearing that person’s name before, but he could not recall it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slender youth whispered something to Bai Zimo and occasionally looked at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. His eyes were filled with provocation and there was a vague hint that he was unconvinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s good mood was ruined, which annoyed her, and that eccentric voice made her even more impatient. “I was wondering who it was. It turned out to be someone I defeated already. I didn’t read my sign before coming out today, or would’ve known that someone would ruin my mood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing originally had a young lady temperament and was spoiled as a child. Her inner thoughts were written on her face. When she saw Bai Zimo come with ill intent, she immediately launched a few words back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words of contempt and disdain, Bai Zimo’s expression suddenly changed and he angrily pointed at Bai Qingqing. After someone had peeled open his scar, even his handsomeness became a little red. It was unknown if he was angry because of Bai Qingqing’s word or embarrassed from what she had said. Bai Zimo had been attracted by the screams of the Wind Ghost Spirit Wolf and had rushed over. He hadn’t expected to find Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing flirting with each other. He also saw that Zhao Jiuge had the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus in his hand, and so he began having crooked thoughts.</span></p>

Back on the stairs, you shined brightly, but you are different from what I imagined. It turns out you’re just someone that knows how to hide behind a woman.” Seeing Bai Zimo being attacked, the slender young man beside him quickly spoke and focused everyone’s attention on Zhao Jiuge. His voice was a bit vicious, but he was unable to hide his flattery toward Bai Zimo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge frowned when he saw the slender guy with whom he had no grievance or grudge with speak so viciously. Zhao Jiuge was someone who wouldn’t allow others to bully him, and this slender boy had come with ill intent. In addition, he was already unhappy with Bai Zimo, so there was no need to give them any face. It was just that he hadn’t expected the good mood from finding the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus to be destroyed so quickly.</span></p>
