 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Could it be related to why the Duty Hall was so empty? However, even if this was related to the new disciples, why would all the old disciples disappear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge could not figure out the reason and simply gave up. He was simply going to find Instructor Zhou and get the details. He was thinking about a lot of things while he exited the Duty Hall, and he walked much faster than normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While thinking about things, he flew toward the Treasure Pavilion on the Blue Plum Sword. He had almost 30 treasures he needed to deal with. Zhao Jiuge felt like he didn’t have enough time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, Zhao Jiuge was startled by the scene of the nearby mountain. He remembered that Fu Hongling lived nearby. With a thought, his flying sword turned left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a while since he saw Fu Hongling. Ever since they parted, the jade tube used to open the restrictions remained inside his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt attached to Fu Hongling. He was still somewhat intoxicated by the feeling of an older sister caring for him. This time, he had gained a lot of Purple Ji Spirit Stone and he thought he should give Fu Hongling some.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lotus Peak appeared before him. Zhao Jiuge quickly took out the jade tube and flew toward Lotus Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft sound echoed and a transparent light appeared. When Zhao Jiuge got close to the transparent light, the jade tube on his hand released the same light. Then a burst of light shined in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Zhao Jiuge went through the layer of light like it wasn’t even there. This surprised him greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He landed on Lotus Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dream-like scenery appeared before Zhao Jiuge once more. The two or three lazy spirit cranes were in the nearby field, casually pecking at something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had too many things to think about to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Lotus Peak. He rushed for the small cabin at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nervously swallowed and carefully walked up to the cabin. Then he stretched his neck and tipped his toes to look inside the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cabin had a simple appearance—it was made of wood from the mountain. This showed that Fu Hongling was a simple person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge could not see the situation inside. He swallowed and boldly shouted, “Senior Sister, are you there?” After he shouted, he carefully listened for movement inside. He was afraid Fu Hongling would come out and scold him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After waiting for a few seconds, there was no response, so Zhao Jiuge shouted once more, but there was still no response. Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what to do and hesitated. His heart tightened and he pushed the door to the small cabin open. The door was unlocked, so it easily opened. The entire Lotus Peak was covered in restrictions, so there should be no problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After opening the door, he saw the inside of the cabin. The cabin was not large, only about a dozen square meters or so. In the far right corner of the room was a wooden bed with a navy-blue mat. There was an ink painting hanging on the wall. The painting was of a cold woman in white flying above a lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also a purple incense stove in the middle of the room. The incense stove was shaped like a gourd and was divided into two layers, with the side slightly bulging. The edges were hollow, and you could see some unknown spices inside. The incense stove was not lit and the top of the stove was firmly sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from these few things inside the room, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the looks of this, Fu Hongling hadn’t been here in a long time. Generally, she was either cultivating at her peak or outside gaining experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge curiously looked at the room and felt a bit disappointed. He originally wanted to give some Purple Ji Spirit Stone to his senior sister, but she wasn’t here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An idea suddenly appeared in his mind. He was going to implement it when he went to find Ou Yezi. The disappointment in his heart lessened a little, and he looked around a bit and then left with a smile. Thinking about how he was the only one who could enter this place freely, Zhao Jiuge felt an inexplicable sense of happiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He left Lotus Peak in a good mood. There were still a lot of things he had to do; otherwise, if he had the time, he would stay at this picturesque mountain peak a bit longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he became more and more familiar with blade soaring, he was able to fly faster and faster. Inside the sect, he didn’t have to worry about the consumption of spirit force. The Blue Plum Sword flew at full speed toward the Treasure Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Treasure Pavilion was completely different compared to the deserted Duty Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment Zhao Jiuge entered, he was startled by the crowd inside the Treasure Pavilion. Why were there so many people here? Among the crowd, he saw various colors of clothing, including the blue that presented the Mysterious Heaven Peak, along with the green and orange that represented the other two peaks. He noticed that they were mostly new disciples, and he even saw a lot of familiar faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something must have happened, and it was absolutely related to this generation of new disciples, as even the disciples of the other two peaks were here. Zhao Jiuge pondered if the selection had begun early, but he quickly rejected the thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The selection was related to the core of the sect and would not be so casually changed. The bigger the commotion, the more curious Zhao Jiuge became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He struggled to squeeze in and looked for the place that accepted treasures from disciples. It was in the right corner and, fortunately, there weren’t many people there. Most people were at the place to buy treasures—they were pondering while looking through the information in the jade tubes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge slowly pushed aside the crowd and arrived at the place to sell treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ordinary-looking young man was lazily looking at the full Treasure Pavilion. The place selling treasures was full, but he had no one here. The young man looked a bit bored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly saw someone struggling to break through the crowd and heading toward his direction. He found Zhao Jiuge struggling through the crowd quite amusing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you here to sell treasures?” The young man raised an eyebrow and smiled. Judging from Zhao Jiuge’s age, he should be a new disciple. Everyone else was rushing to spend their sect contributions to buy treasures, yet Zhao Jiuge wanted to sell. The young man became interested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. There sure are a lot of people here.” Zhao Jiuge relaxed a bit while complaining. He looked at the ordinary-looking yet warm youth.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to sell some treasures. They are all weapons around magic treasure-grade. There are almost 30 pieces.” Zhao Jiuge gave the details of what he was selling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was shocked. He frowned with uncertainty and shouted, “What? Are you sure you want to sell 20 to 30 treasures and not two or three?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s cry caused a change to the originally noisey first floor. The people near Zhao Jiuge immediately stopped and turned toward him. The people near the front noticed that it suddenly became quiet here and looked back. When they noticed that everyone was looking at Zhao Jiuge, they became curious and wanted to know what had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge attracted everyone’s gazes and everything quieted down. Whether it was those that knew what had happened or those that didn't, they all became silent and waited to see what was going to happen next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out an unnatural smile when he saw this. He weakly said something that caused the scene to erupt again. “Yes, I’m here to sell 20 to 30 treasures, not two or three.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The quiet scene suddenly erupted. Whether it was the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples or the disciples of the other two peaks, everyone began to talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn’t that our Mysterious Heaven Peak’s Zhao Jiuge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, he said he was going to sell 20 to 30 treasures. Where did he get so many treasures?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two new disciples wearing blue sword robes opened their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a disciple from the Mysterious Fallen Peak said in a strange tone, “Hey, hey, is that brother from your Mysterious Heaven Peak? Is he bragging?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the strange tone of the disciple from the Mysterious Fallen Peak, two Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples replied with unhappy tones, “So what if he is from our Mysterious Heaven Peak?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I guess your Mysterious Heaven Peak’s strength is lacking, only knowing how to brag.” The disciple from the Mysterious Fallen Peak laughed dismissively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the two disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak were suddenly enraged. Although they had some doubts about Zhao Jiuge, they still belonged to the same faction. Now that the Mysterious Fallen Peak was slandering them, they immediately defended Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, the three of them began yelling at each other. If it wasn’t for the fact that the sect rules were very strict, they would have already begun fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every corner of the hall had different reactions, but everyone was filled with shock, along with a trace of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that were shocked by this information were still talking to each other about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where did this guy get so many treasures? Wasn’t he with Leng Rufeng’s group? He isn’t a disciple from an influential family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who knows? The sect sent a message about holding some training for the selection. This made everyone scramble to get treasures to prepare, but his guys came here to sell instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples were muttering, which caused a response from a nearby Mysterious Strange Peak disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I worked myself to death and almost died doing missions to save a few hundred sect contributions. I came to the Treasure Pavilion to get myself a useful treasure, how did I meet this kind of freak?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were all kinds of reactions from the people here. There was hatred, envy, and doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has to be said that missions didn’t give much sect contributions. New disciples like them lacked strength, spells, and treasures, so they could only do simple missions for very little sect contributions, and they had to work hard for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sometimes, they even did missions in groups and had to split the sect contributions. How could they all be as lucky as Zhao Jiuge, who had decent strength himself but also knew someone like Bai Qingqing, who would give him all her sect contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, most of the disciples had only a few hundred sect contributions, which was barely enough to buy something. And these disciples were better off than most—those that weren’t here didn’t even have a few hundred sect contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they knew Zhao Jiuge had more than 2,000 sect contributions, these new disciples would definitely die from anger.</span></p>
