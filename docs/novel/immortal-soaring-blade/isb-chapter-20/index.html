 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe everyone knows that the path of cultivation first requires one to forge the body and be able to detect spiritual energy. Then change the blood until spirit force can be used outside the body. For these early realms, as long as time passes, they are achievable, but why do most people get stuck at the late stage of Spirit Transformation?” Old Mo stopped for a moment and observed the crowd. After he saw that he had their attention, he continued, “That’s because breaking past the Spirit Transformation Realm is a qualitative leap. The average person can’t break past this bottleneck, and entering the Foundation Realm is a drastic change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This we all know. Stop being so mysterious and just tell us what the last thing is!” The burly man’s impatient voice echoed. “Yes, tell us what the last thing is.” Most of the people who shouted couldn’t even afford it, but they were more excited than the people who could afford it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blue Spirit Pill. I won’t say anything about the effect of this pill, hehe.” Old Mo opened his hand and a walnut-sized pill releasing a faint, blue light laid in the center of his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from a few people, the crowd went into an uproar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, Blue Spirit Pill. It has been a long time since a small city like ours has had something this good. How did the Mo family get their hands on something like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With the Blue Spirit Pill, anyone can have a chance to break into the Foundation Realm, but it is merely a chance. Do you think it would be that easy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blue Spirit Pill caused an uproar, and one young man was loudly debating. “Hmph, the path to immortality is vast—as long as there is a chance, there is a way. What do you know? Besides, do you know how the Mo family got the Blue Spirit Pill?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did they get it?” a man beside him curiously asked. “I heard that it was during a fight against the Xiao family, and the Xiao family’s second son was seriously injured. I heard that some unknown youth helped the Mo family seize it.” The young man looked around and lowered his voice. “Did you notice that the Xiao family didn’t show up at all today? The Mo family has earned a lot of spirit stones today. I think that in a few days, the Xiao family will go look for trouble with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The burly man suddenly stood up and his eyes widened like two large bells. He was so excited that his cheeks trembled and his breathing became rough. He had been stuck at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm for many years, and now there was finally hope. “This Blue Spirit Pill is mine!” Even his voice became hoarse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elegant, middle-aged scholar was equally excited and his face was filled with shock as he stared at Old Mo’s hand. He had also been stuck at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm for many years. How great it would be to reach the Foundation Realm? The Foundation Realm was the true door to the path of being an immortal. Right now, they were still at the stage of forging the body and forming their spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged scholar calmed his heart. “Hmph, you think you will get it just because you want it? Did your family open this auction house? Do you have that many spirit stones?!” His eyebrows rose as he rolled his eyes and spoke disdainfully to the burly man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo was very satisfied with the reaction of the people, and his eyes revealed the sign of a true adulterer. “Blue Spirit Pill, 4,000 spirit stones starting price. Highest bidder wins.” Seeing the burly man and the middle-aged scholar arguing made Old Mo set the price. Everyone became silent for a moment, then noise burst out once more. 4,000 spirit stones was a large number, so this once again shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Old Mo’s voice, the burly man suddenly closed his mouth and his face turned red. He looked at the Blue Spirit Pill in Old Mo’s hand with reluctance before he lowered his head and a trace of determination appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“3,600 spirit stones plus the Wu Chen Fan in exchange. If anyone can produce one more piece of spirit stone, then I forfeit,” the elegant, middle-aged scholar said loudly as he proudly looked at the burly man. He let out a cold snort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small families here were all hesitating. They all looked around and wanted to see who else would offer. Only these small families would have accumulated enough spirit stones to afford it, but they were reluctant to spend it. After all, unless one was already a late stage Spirit Transformation, it would be a waste. The auction house gradually became silent and everyone looked at the Blue Spirit Pill in Old Mo’s hand and then at the elegant, middle-aged scholar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deal.” Seeing that no one beside the middle-aged scholar was bidding, Old Mo announced the result, and there was a hint of joy in his eyes. He was originally going to auction it for 3,000 spirit stones, but after seeing everyone's mood, he had increased the price and had actually sold it successfully!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the middle-aged scholar successfully purchase the Blue Spirit Pill and even trading away his magical treasure, the burly man’s eyes lit up. He clenched his teeth in hesitation and then a trace of viciousness appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, fellow friends, this auction is over. Next time, if my Mo family has something good, I’ll be sure to inform everyone.” Everything had sold, so Old Mo was particularly happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people slowly flowed toward the exit. Zhao Jiuge was playing around with the Li Fire Flag, and his face was filled with joy as he followed Mo Longjie out. The gloomy old man had disappeared early and the burly man had quietly followed the middle-aged scholar out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge pulled open the black curtain, he saw the scene in the alley outside. His face tightened and his eyes squinted as he stared outside. He was a bit lost as to what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie looked outside and slowly frowned as he expressionlessly stared at the scene before him. He then thought that what was to come had finally come. The Mo family had always been a head above the Xiao family, and what they feared the most was the first son of the Xiao family entering the Flowing Cloud Sect. However, it didn’t mean that the Mo family feared the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about this, Mo Longjie released his brows and revealed a faint smile. A faint but elegant aura spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mo Longjie, your mood seems pretty good, but that makes sense. You robbed the Blue Moon Grass and refined Blue Spirit Pills,” a thin, middle-aged man with a hook nose and caved-in eyes said in a strange voice. He gave off an overbearing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing beside him was the arrogant Xiao Zhan, holding a large, blood-colored blade. Behind them were no less than 30 &nbsp;men wearing blood-colored light armor and armed with various weapons. They carefully stared at the people coming out of the alley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at the other party ready to fight, Zheng Jie frowned and waved his right hand. The sounds of footsteps echoed and dozens of men wearing black, light armor that were around during the auction suddenly gathered. They were no less fierce than the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the killing intent, all the cultivators that had come out of the auction house became silent as they looked on with curiosity. This was the first time the two large families had thrown out all pretense. The only one with powerful cultivation left was the Old Sloppy Daoist, who was shouting at them to quickly fight. Soon people even surrounded the entrance to the alley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hook-nosed man scanned the other side and found the young man standing next to Mo Lingjie. He shouted, “Oh, so you’re the one that hurt my family’s Little Yu and helped the Mo family snatch away the Blue Moon Grass. Let’s see how I’ll deal with you today.” Then he released his late Spirit Transformation Realm pressure toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s handsome face suddenly turned white as he felt his body tremble and subconsciously took two steps back. He suddenly felt his body become light and everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does bullying a junior count as, Xiao Yi it seems the longer you live the more immature you become.” Mo Longjies let out a cold snort and spread out his spirit force. A pressure from his spirit force spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, those spirit force fluctuations just now feel so familiar.” At this moment, a crisp voice secretly muttered among the crowd as a pair of beautiful eyes stared at the jade pendant on Zhao Jiuge. This was the jade pendant the old man had left Zhao Jiuge, and earlier, when the pressure descended upon him, there was a flash of light that no one else noticed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl inside the crowd looked at the jade pendant and then at its master. A 14-year-old boy with a handsome face, black coat, and a longsword on his back. His hair was tied up with a black cloth and he didn’t seem to have panicked. In fact, he could still be considered as calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then her eyes, which were filled with spirit, seemed to be thinking of something and she revealed a fox-like smile. She pursed her lips and blinked as if she had decided on something.</span></p>
