 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/2021-roadmap-site-redesign-karma-changes-ebooks-more">Read More...</a> </p>

        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was breathing hard as he looked at the figures passing him, but he didn’t give up or use more spirit force to power up the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still endured step after step, and he was almost halfway up. Walking fast now didn’t mean walking further. Only at the end would he know who would get the last laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the first place had changed as Mu Zijun passed the 500th step, while the youth with the dimples barely made it to the 500th step. He was like a dried-up oil lamp. Both were at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, but the gap was quite obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo was not too fast or too slow as he followed behind Mu Zijun, ranked second. Although he was arrogant, he still admired Mu Zijun’s cultivation because no matter how hard he tried, he could not catch up to him. In the end, he abandoned the idea of catching up and just followed behind. This indirectly helped him conserve some spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then it was that alluring girl who walked up the steps with a smile as if she didn’t feel any sense of pressure. She would occasionally look back to observe the situation of the people behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were seven or eight more Spirit Transformation youths who were gritting their teeth as they resisted the pressure and struggled to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind them was Zhao Jiuge and those he met on the third floor, all around the 300th step. Zhao Jiuge didn’t expect Liu Yinger to erupt and catch up to him. Lou Xie seemed to have recovered from his shock. Wang Baiwan still had his usual funny appearance and sweated a lot more than others. His clothes were soaked and every step he took left a wet footprint. He was gasping and the fat on his body shook. When he gritted his teeth, his eyes seemed to sink into the flesh on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the people behind him, they either couldn’t move due to the pressure or were dried oil lamps that couldn’t last much longer. They weren’t worthy of Zhao Jiuge’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, Wu Tianshan and the Mysterious Heaven Asura were watching and felt a bit bored. Aside from the excitement from when Mu Zijun displayed his spell, nothing notable had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, there is nothing good to watch. Tell Instructor Zhou that those below the 300th step have failed and to take the rest into the outer sect. If there are any with good talent, take them into the inner sect after three years. Otherwise, it's better not to have them at all than to have them rot in the outer sect. We can wait another 10 years.” After the Mysterious Heaven Asura finished speaking, he waved his sleeve and prepared to leave. There was a little disappointment on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been 30 years. Three waves of recruitment and there was no one worth nurturing. He couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. He was worried about the same thing, just like Wu Tianshan, but he could not afford to say it. If there was no one that could stand out after Wu Tianshan’s generation, then the position of head teacher would really fall to the Mysterious Strange Peak or the Mysterious Fallen Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Tianshan just nodded and was about to speak when a spirit force even more explosive than Mu Zijun’s erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mysterious Heaven Asura was turning around when he suddenly stopped. His cold face had a dull expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After crossing the 400th step, Zhao Jiuge could no longer resist the pressure and it felt like the bones in his body were ready to break. This kind of soreness wasn't something that could be explained. He was almost half way up, and at this moment, a hint of madness appeared in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AHHHHHHHHH!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a roar into the sky as if he wanted to vent out all the pain inside his body. Then, with great difficulty, his hands began forming mysterious seals. As he formed seals, a faint, gold spirit force light appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could no longer save spirit force, and spirit force gushed through the veins in his body. The increase in spirit force caused the effect of the Sanskrit Divine Body to become much stronger. The light around his body was no longer a faint, golden light, it was now bright and crystal clear like a layer of glass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the increase in Zhao Jiuge’s aura and spirit force, the steps seemed to have become angry and increased their suction force. Zhao Jiuge felt like his spirit force was being pulled away by the steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A majestic dragon roar echoed inside his body. The golden dragon that had been lying inside his body felt the pressure and opened its eyes in anger. It let out angry roars of provocation inside Zhao Jiuge’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he completely released the power of the Sanskrit Divine Body, although his spirit force was constantly being exhausted, he no longer felt any pressure. The golden dragon in his body seemed to have gotten into a competition with the steps. The two were fighting over the spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His entire body suddenly felt relaxed. Although the pressure was gone, the soreness still existed in his body. Now a series of crackling sounds echoed inside his body because the pressure from the steps had reached a violent level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge was completely focused on what was in front of him and didn’t notice the change in his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s entire body was shrouded by a smiling buddha made of a looming light around his body. This was the same smiling buddha that had appeared in his dantian after he began cultivating the Sanskrit Heart Sutra. His body was surrounded by an auspicious light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This shocked everyone greatly. This power was even more overbearing than Mu Zijin’s Boundless Flying Art!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Tianshan was filled with shock. He asked the Mysterious Heaven Asura, “Martial Uncle, what spell is that? It is powerful, but I have never seen it before him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mysterious Heaven Asura was contemplating with his cold expression. He looked at Zhao Jiuge’s figure carefully and his eyes shined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I also don’t know. The Huaxia Dynasty is a vast place—there are all sorts of mysterious and wondrous cultivation methods being created. I have not seen this before. It seems like I was wrong this time, let us keep watching.” The Mysterious Heaven Asura became interested after seeing Zhao Jiuge’s performance. He looked forward to what Zhao Jiuge would do next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge continued to walk up the stairs and didn’t feel any pressure. This speed shocked the three instructors and the other youths taking the trial. They all stared at Zhao Jiuge’s figure rushing up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is this person? How did his speed increase so much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn, is this still just someone testing to be a disciple? His aura is already extraordinary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, so handsome!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even more powerful than Bai Zimo and Mu Zijun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, no one could match Zhao Jiuge’s momentum. Even those youths that had lost the power to move still looked up at Zhao Jiuge despite the soreness in their bodies. Their faces were filled with shock and worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo felt like something was wrong behind him. He looked back and saw Zhao Jiuge quickly charging up. This caused his face to change greatly. He could no longer just follow behind Miu Zijun. If he didn’t speed up, Zhao Jiuge would overtake him. His hands quickly formed seals and his body was surrounded by an extraordinary light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He no longer wanted to look behind him and instead focused on getting moving forward. There was only one thought in Bai Zimo’s mind, which was to enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect as rank one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun looked at this without any change in his expression, but in his heart, he was shocked. He thought that with his talent and the resources of the Mu family, combined with the fall of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he would be able to stand above all to be number one among this generation of disciples. However, now not only was there Bai Zimo, there was also the black horse, Zhao Jiuge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijin also clearly sensed that there were a few auras that were no weaker than his among the crowd, but they just didn’t want to be so high profile. Thinking about this, Mu Zijun’s expression changed and he let out a sigh as he wondered why there were so many talented people this time. He no longer thought about it and used all his strength to climb upward. After more than 600 steps, even with his family’s spell and his late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm spirit force, he was beginning to feel tired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl smiled and muttered to herself, “Interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then her fiery figure and exposed, white skin shined and a burst of pink, mist-like spirit light burst out. It formed a barrier of plum flowers that surrounded her body. These plum flowers continuously spewed out and fell down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was already very alluring and charming with her provocative clothes. Now, with the pink mist, she was even more charming and caused all the youths around her to swallow hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After using her spell, she also turned into a shadow and charged forward. She was side by side with Zhao Jiuge and would occasionally look over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her beautiful eyes stared at Zhao Jiuge, which made him blush and feel quite embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge reveal a shy expression on his handsome face, the alluring girl smiled. Her chest bounced as if it were ready to explode out from her clothes. Even Zhao Jiuge had to take advantage of the time when she wasn’t looking at him to swallow the saliva gathered in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge intended to speed up, but no matter how fast he moved, the alluring girl seemed to be glued to him. She was able to casually keep up with him. Zhao Jiuge was shocked and thought that this girl was no weaker than Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl seemed to be very curious about Zhao Jiuge. She was not angry about Zhao Jiuge’s actions and still had a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the trial was reaching the most heated moment. Most people were stuck where they were and could no longer move due to the pressure. They could only look at the several people that were still going up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Mu Zijun was at the 675th step. He no longer had the elegant appearance he had before. His face was pale and it was obvious that he was giving it his all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo was at 638th step. He was gritting his teeth and his hair was covered in sweat. His eyes were filled with stubbornness as he was unwilling to lose and forced himself to go up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge and the alluring girl had reached the 600th step side by side. Every 100 steps, the pressure changed, and Zhao Jiuge felt this clearly. He found that even with the Sanskrit Divine Body, he was feeling the pressure. Then he looked at the alluring girl beside him and saw that her face was calm, as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
