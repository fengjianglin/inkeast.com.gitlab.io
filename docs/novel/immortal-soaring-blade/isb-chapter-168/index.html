 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

He hadn’t expected to cause such a big commotion just from trying to sell some treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had heard some useful information from the people talking. He knew about the training, and some of the questions he had were answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder no one was going out on missions and the Treasure Pavilion was filled with people. People were all getting ready for the training before the inner sect selection. Although Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what this training was, it was clearly of great importance. Otherwise, the new disciples wouldn’t act like this. Even the older disciples were attracted by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Zhao Jiuge wanted to ask, a figure rushed out from the crowd and patted Zhao Jiuge’s shoulder. This shocked Zhao Jiuge greatly and he quickly looked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng had a smile on his face while he looked at Zhao Jiuge, completely ignoring the burning gazes behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you also here?” Zhao Jiuge was a bit shocked that Leng Rufeng was also here. He was already at the early stage of the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t be here? Can it be that only you’re allowed here?” Leng Rufeng angrily rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, the training is about to begin, so it's good that you came back. I told Luo Xie to stay at the residence to wait for you. I came by to see some treasures and buy a flying sword. No matter what quality, having one is better than being empty-handed. After all, all three peaks will participate in the training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His tone was a bit excited. This was the first time the disciples of the three peaks would meet. No one knew what kind of sparks would fly. In the sect, strength was respected, just like how academic performance was respected in the villages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, did you buy one?” Zhao Jiuge seemed to be infected by Leng Rufeng’s passionate words and felt his blood inexplicably boil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng didn’t seem to expect Zhao Jiuge to ask so directly. He subconsciously wanted to say something but immediately caught himself. His mouth opened a little and he had a somewhat complicated expression on his face. A moment later, he smiled. “Of course. Quickly, sell your treasures. We need to go back and discuss the training. Luo Xie is still waiting for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, what he didn’t say was that he had indeed come to buy a magic treasure, but he had found that even the most garbage magic treasure flying sword cost 200 to 300 sect contributions. He had just reached the Foundation Realm and hadn’t had a chance to go earn more sect contributions. The sect contributions he had earned before wasn’t much and had to be split between several people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Zhao Jiuge just nodded and didn’t say more. He turned around and began talking to the young man about selling the treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the moment Zhao Jiuge turned around, his calm expression turned into a smile, but he tried his best not to laugh. When he saw Leng Rufeng’s expression, how could he not know what had really happened. This made him change his mind about selling all these treasures. He decided to keep Han Songcheng and Vulture’s flying swords. However, he was going to tease Leng Rufeng a bit first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng smiled on the side while Zhao Jiuge sold the treasures. He remained silent and his eyes were filled with excitement. The three peaks were going to do a joint training session, and with Zhao Jiuge back, he felt more confident. Although the disciples from influential families hadn’t come to find any trouble recently, he still felt uncertain without Zhao Jiuge here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, flashes of light appeared before Zhao Jiuge one after the other. The lights came from treasures being taken out one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd in the hall were all dumbfounded. Some of them counted, and there was a total of 29 treasures. This guy really had that many. They were all weapons, and not many were flying swords, but this was enough to shock them all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young was stunned for a moment before he reacted. Compared to the new disciples, he had seen much more. Over the years, he had seen many strange things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a little, I need to look at them one by one to tell you the specific prices. After all, the amount is a lot more than usual.” The ordinary-looking young man smiled apologetically. He then picked up the treasures one by one and examined them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the hall stared at this shocking scene without blinking. The atmosphere became a little strange. Zhao Jiuge felt uncomfortable and rubbed his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was very fast. After he finished checking all 29 treasures, he looked up at Zhao Jiuge with a smile and said, “A total of 29 pieces of magic treasure for a total of 5,800 sect contributions. Let’s round it to a whole number—how about 6,000 sect contributions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Zhao Jiuge could answer, the crowd erupted once more. 6,000 sect contributions was undoubtedly a large number for new disciples like them. This was enough to buy a few precious treasures!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that were at the Treasure Pavilion were all poor disciples like Zhao Jiuge. The disciples from influential families would not worry about resources like this. For them, just having a magic treasure was already very good. After all, they had only been in the sect for two years. When they heard the young man say 6,000 sect contributions, they were filled with envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, I’ll trouble Senior Brother.” Zhao Jiuge felt very satisfied with 6,000 sect contributions. This price was very accurate. Even if it were less, Zhao Jiuge was still going to sell. It was useless for him to keep them, so might as well trade them for different resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He handed over his wooden token, and with a flash of light, 6,000 sect contributions were recorded on it. Including the more than 2,000 sect contributions from his missions, Zhao Jiuge had 8,200 sect contributions. This was almost enough for a garbage sword embryo. However, if Zhao Jiuge was going to refine a flying sword, he wasn’t going to refine a bad sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was better to use the sect contributions to get materials to refine the armor first. Seeing how the people were staring at him with red eyes, Zhao Jiuge gave up on the idea of buying materials. It would be impossible for him to buy anything in this situation. He would come back here again before going to get his armor refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly pulled Leng Rufeng and pushed through the crowd out of the Treasure Pavilion. There were still people staring at Zhao Jiuge’s back. The matter at the Treasure Pavilion today spread across the three peaks. They all knew that there was a freak like this in the Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the Treasure Pavilion, Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh of relief. He still felt some lingering fear as he said, “I didn’t expect so many people to be here today. Just selling some treasures caused such a commotion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng smiled “That’s because you have the skills. You obtained them all due to your strength. Even if we wanted to cause that kind of commotion, with the necessary strength, we can’t do anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re just trying to tease me again. Didn’t you also break through to the Foundation Realm? Everything will slowly get better.” Zhao Jiuge felt a bit embarrassed by Leng Rufeng’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Zhao Jiuge bring up his cultivation level, Leng Rufeng’s smile widened and his eyes were burning with passion. “I went to ask Instructor Zhou about it. He said that I’ll have to wait for the training to end to enter the spirit vein to temper my body. A lot more people across all three peaks are reaching the Foundation Realm, so we are all going together after the training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, this is the first time the three peaks are training together. You are among the best of the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples. Are you confident in showing off and giving our Mysterious Heaven Peak some prestige?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The details of the training haven’t been announced yet and we don’t know the situation about the other two peaks. When the time comes, we’ll see.” Zhao Jiuge yearned for the training to begin. As a youth, who didn’t want to show off before their peers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, the instructors will give details about the training in three days.” While they spoke, they were rushing toward Zhao Jiuge’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was still a hint of disappointment in Leng Rufeng’s eyes. When he and Zhao Jiuge first met, they got along well because they were very similar. He also felt that the timing of the training was not good for himself, unlike Zhao Jiuge. If it was a bit later, he would have tempered his body inside the spirit vein and earned enough sect contributions to buy a flying sword. Then he would be able to shine before the disciples of the three peaks and perhaps catch the attention of someone powerful in the sect. However, reality was cruel. There were too many what ifs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, the two walked and chatted. They talked about what they had experienced in the past six months. Time passed by quickly and the two of them unknowingly arrived at Zhao Jiuge’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge pushed open the door and saw Luo Xie seriously cultivating. Luo Xie was no longer as lazy and had reached the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only about eight months left before the inner sect selection. The threshold to enter was to reach the Foundation Realm. If he couldn’t even enter the Foundation Realm, he wouldn’t be qualified to participate, much less enter the inner sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Leng Rufeng’s words disturpted Luo Xie, who suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw that it was Zhao Jiuge and Leng Rufeng, he smiled and immediately got up. He excitedly hugged Zhao Jiuge and vigorously patted his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re finally back, you brat. I’ve been waiting for you for a few days already. It’s been a while since you returned from your confinement. But we haven’t had time to get together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was also very excited and seriously examined Luo Xie. After two years of growth, Luo Xie had changed a bit. Not only was he taller, he didn’t look as naive as before, and they were now both 17 years old. Thinking back to how they were when they entered the sect, he couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge explained, “Am I not back now? I should stay for a while, but once the training is over, I need to complete one more mission before the selection.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You both have entered the Foundation Realm, but I still need to work hard. After this training, Leng Rufeng and I will go out on missions as well.” Luo Xie had a big smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were a group of brothers that got along very well. No matter the time or circumstance, they would always remain true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie seemed to remember something. He looked at Leng Rufeng and said, “Didn’t you go to the Treasure Pavilion today? Did you manage to buy a flying sword?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warm atmosphere suddenly solidified and Leng Rufeng’s smile suddenly froze. He didn’t know how to talk about this problem. His gaze shifted between Luo Xie and Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Luo Xie saw this, he was a bit confused, but when he realized that they had come back together, he seemed to understand something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahaha, you two brats call me ‘big brother.’ If you say it well, there will be surprise.'' The originally depressing atmosphere was instantly broken by Zhao Jiuge’s laughter. He had a smile on his face that would make anyone want to beat him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want Leng Rufeng to be in a difficult position. They had known each other for a while, how could he not understand their personalities? He had teased them enough and it was time to take out the flying swords he was going to give them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie and Leng Rufeng were both confused, but they were unwilling to accept his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng smiled and scolded, “Someone like you wants to be the big brother? Has all of your hair even grown out yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, that’s right. I don’t know if you’re even as tall as us, yet you want to take advantage of us.” Luo Xie joined in on the fun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was originally just going to tease them, but their responses made him a bit depressed. There were two flashes of light and the grey flying sword and the blood-colored flying sword that belonged to Han Songcheng and Vulture appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two flying swords hummed softly. The blood-colored light and grey light were especially eye-catching in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge raised his head slightly and rolled his eyes. He pretended to be careless and said, “Ah, forget it. I was ready to give these two flyings words to my brothers. I can’t help it that people don't appreciate my kindness. Looks like I can’t even give them away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he pretended to sigh and revealed a grumbling expression.</span></p>
