 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outskirts of Dong Yang City had a sea of people. Not only had the small families come, even the majority of the rogue cultivators around Dong Yang City had come. The Old Sloppy Daoist was also here to watch the show. If Zhao Jiuge were here, he would be shocked to find that this old daoist was actually at the Foundation Realm! Next to him was the little daoist boy again, his disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the mysterious, gloomy, skinny old man, he was nowhere to be found. Another person that didn’t appear was the elegant, middle-aged scholar, but the burly man who had gotten into a dispute with him was here. He was leaning against a tree trunk and his entire body looked really weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On that day, the two of them had competed for the Blue Spirit Pill, but in the end, he didn’t have enough spirit stones and got into a spat with the middle-aged scholar. He didn’t like how the elegant middle-aged scholar had acted and also noticed that the elegant middle-aged scholar had even traded away his own treasure, causing the burly man to have ill intent. He followed the elegant middle-aged scholar out of the city and the two of them battled. In the end, both of them suffered varying degrees of injuries and the elegant, middle-aged scholar escaped somewhere, leaving behind the weakened burly man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining were all rogue cultivators with weak cultivation. They are all happily chatting as if they were watching a good show. All the small families were all nervously waiting for the result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xiao family’s crowd was moving as Xiao Yi and Xiao Zhang arrogantly and proudly talked to each other. Behind them was the Xiao family’s guards, who all wore blood-colored armor. They were in a neat formation, and although they were silent, they could not hide the pride on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from Xiao Yu, who was beside Xiao Yi, there were two more young men standing there. One of the young men was in his early 20s and had a cold expression. Only when he talked to the young man slightly older than him would he reveal a respectful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other young man, who was wearing a navy blue robe, was about 27 or 28 years old. He had a plain expression as he talked to the other young man, but his face would always show off a hint of arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, how come the Mo family still hasn’t arrived? It has been more than half a day, could they be afraid?” Xiao Yu said viciously on the side. He had been seriously injured by Zhao Jiuge and had been healing at home for most of the month before being allowed to come out. “Big Brother, you have to get revenge for me today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man in his early 20s nodded. “Don’t worry, my Xiao family has been suppressed by the Mo family for many years. It's time to turn the situation around.” After pausing for a moment, he turned toward the other young man &nbsp;and said, “I’ll have to trouble Senior Brother today. After today’s matter, my Xiao family will not treat Senior Brother poorly.” The older young man arrogantly nodded but didn’t say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that the young man in his early 20s was Xiao Yu’s big brother, Xiao Yun, the who had entered the Flowing Cloud Sect. Next to him was his senior brother, another disciple of the Flowing Cloud Sect. Just as everyone became anxious, a crowd appeared in the distance. Feeling the spirit force fluctuations, everyone looked over and saw the Mo family. They hadn’t even arrived yet, but their aura was like a readied blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I thought you were a turtle, Mo Longjie. You were so slow that I thought you were afraid to show.” Xiao Yi smiled as the Mo family arrived and began to insult them immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I’m afraid no one will be afraid of you Xiao Yi. Ah, your Xiao family has been suppressed by my Mo family for so many years. Today, you are here to court death.” Mo Lingjie revealed a smile and gently swept his gaze past the Xiao family. When he saw the young man who was around 27 to 28 years old, his expression sank a bit. However, after feeling the young man’s spirit force fluctuations, he relaxed a bit. It was fortunate the Flowing Cloud Sect hadn’t sent any old monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Mo Longjie’s words, Xiao Yi couldn’t help but feel anger from the embarrassment. After so many years of being suppressed by the Mo family, he knew the pain in his heart. “Hmph, after today, who knows who will be suppressing who. Enough nonsense, there are a lot of people here waiting to watch a fight.” Xiao Yi’s eyes were filled with excitement while thinking about how the Xiao family would turn things around after today, which caused him to shout arrogantly at Mo Longjie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heheh, then come. It has been many years since I battled you, Xiao Yi. Let’s see how far you’ve come.” Mo Longjie walked up a few steps and his eyes filled with disdain as if he was provoking Xiao Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi’s eyes sunk in and his gloomy face gave off a dark aura. “Then let me come teach you a lesson in the first round.” He was always hot-tempered, and when provoked by Mo Longjie, he immediately waved the Wolf Tooth Hammer in his hand and walked forward a few steps toward Mong Longjie. The two of them stopped and stared at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the killing intent between the two of them, the surrounding people all retreated, giving them some space. “Xiao Yi, why is your temper still like that after all these years? You’re like a mad dog that gets angry at everything.” At the same time, Mo Longjie took out a short ruler. Its body gave off a silver light and could be considered top-quality even among precious treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Mo Longjie’s mocking words and seeing Mo Longjie’s spirit force spread out, Xiao Yi’s gloomy face became bright red. He quickly sped up his own spirit force and surged it into the Wolf Tooth Hammer in his hand. The Wolf Tooth Hammer released a flash of golden light, and along with that, a strand of snake-like lightning appeared on the surface of the hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was another precious treasure, a precious treasure with its own attribute. Xiao Yi was not holding back at all. As spirit force surged in, the Wolf Tooth Hammer became brighter and brighter and the crackling sounds became even louder. The lighting around the hammer became large and flew toward Mo Longjie like a net.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the power of the Wolf Tooth Hammer and the pressure it released, the weaker cultivators’ faces turned white and they subconsciously stepped back, gasping for air. Mo Longjie looked at the lightning net but was still as calm as before—he didn’t even blink once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He waved the short ruler in his hand and the ruler turned milky-white like jade. A ray of spirit light shot out of it, heading toward the lightning net. At this moment, various colors of light shined and fluctuations of spirit force echoed in the outskirts of Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two collided, the electric net melted like snow. It was like an iceberg melting due to the blazing sun. The silver spirit light became dim and continued to fly toward Xiao Yi. Xiao Yi let out a cold snort and smashed toward the silver spirit light, knocking it aside. The light gradually became dim and then dissipated completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then Xiao Yi clenched his teeth and opened his arm, leaving the Wolf Tooth Hammer floating in the air as his hands formed seals. The Wolf Tooth Hammer trembled as lighting began to move across its surface like snakes. As he did this, a terrifying aura spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mo Longjies sensed the power released by the Wolf Tooth Hammer, his pupils shrank and his expression became heavy. He quickly adjusted his own aura and his spirit force surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes of the surrounding people shined as they observed the two of them battle. For some of them, this kind of battle was something they could only see once in their lifetimes. For some, they swallowed hard and looked at the magical treasures with envy in their eyes. For the average person, even a magic treasure was already very good. As for the small families, they nervously looked at the two men battling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wolf Tooth Hammer trembled violently as Xiao Yi finished the final seal, then he spat out a mouthful of essence blood onto it. After that, his entire body weakened and the Hammer flew into the air. The lighting around it was as wide as a barrel, and it looked like a giant python as it flew down toward Mo Longjie</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the terrifying aura, Mo Longjie didn’t dare to slow down. His right hand gently rose the short ruler before his chest. He trembled and started forming seals with his hands. Compared to Xiao Yi, he was much faster. A moment later, his right hand waved the ruler and there was a flash of silver light. Then a huge, silver dragon appeared and rushed toward the giant python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver dragon against the giant python. Just as they were about to collide, the silver dragon turned its head and its tail lashed out. A silver light covered the lightning python, and in the blink of an eye, the giant python disappeared. The short ruler was actually a spatial weapon that contained its own space and power over space. At this moment, Mo Longjie’s face was pale as he quickly formed seals to refine the giant lightning python formed by Xiao Yi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His spirit force had been cut off by Mo Longjie, which injured his internal organs, while Mo Longjie’s face was only a bit white. While Xiao Yi was weakened, Mo Longjie went in for the kill. A surge of spirit force shot out toward Xiao Yi like a stream of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi endured the discomfort in his body and forced himself to gather his little remaining spirit force to protect his own body. The stream of spirit force hit Xiao Yi with a bang and he was sent flying while coughing out more blood. It was fortunate that he protected his body with what little spirit force he had left, or it wouldn't have been him merely coughing out blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surroundings went into an uproar. Xiao Yi was also at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, so they hadn’t expected him to lose so quickly. The surrounding people looked at Mo Longjie in shock and fear. The Mo family was worthy of being the largest family in Dong Yang City, their heritage was very deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mo family had won the first battle, and Mo Longjie only revealed a faint smile. Xiao Yi was helped up by Xiao Yu. It was unknown if it was due to his injuries or anger, but his face changed between green and white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was wondering what to do, the young man in the navy blue robe let out a cold snort and said, “Flowing Cloud Sect’s Liu Feng, please advise me.” This voice was cold and contained a hint of arrogance. He raised his chin to look down upon the Mo family.</span></p>
