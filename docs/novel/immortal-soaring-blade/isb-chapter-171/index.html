 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the youth with the scar leading the group, Zhao Jiuge was confused. This was the first time they had met after he had seriously injured the youth with the scar in their battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then seven or eight people followed up, making Zhao Jiuge’s expression sink. He estimated that they were up to no good. These people were all familiar faces—Bai Zimo, Mu Zijun, and the others were all among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Zhao Jiuge was observing them, more than a dozen people also surrounded them. All of a sudden, more than 20 people had surrounded Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused all the other disciples that were going to leave to stop and look over in excitement. Most of them were those that were timid or some of the female disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng and Luo Xie saw that something was going on and looked over. When they found that the one being surrounded was Zhao Jiuge, Leng Rufeng’s expression became gloomy. He and Luo Xie angrily led 20 to 30 people over. The two of them stood behind Zhao Jiuge. At this moment, the other side had gathered about 40 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing people blocking his path, Zhao Jiuge asked in an unfriendly tone, “Something the matter?” When he saw the youth with the scar and those old acquaintances with whom he had already torn down all pretense with, he knew they had come with ill intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar completely ignored him. He smiled at the girl behind Zhao Jiuge and said, “Qingqing, long time no see. You’re more charming than before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot.” Bai Qingqing coldly spat out a single word. Her eyes were as calm as water, and no waves were set off just because the youth with the scar had thrown a stone in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Zijun and Bai Zimo looked at the three of them playfully. Their arms were folded and they quietly watched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the youth with the scar was scolded by Bai Qingqing, the smile on his face didn’t fade, but instead became even wider. He still intended to step past Zhao Jiuge and walk next to Bai Qingqing. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge stepped between them and coldly smiled. “A good dog doesn’t block the road. Now tell us why you’re blocking our path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, it was as if the youth with the scar could only see Zhao Jiuge. He leaned forward and his face was only a centimeter from Zhao Jiuge’s. Then he looked up and down at Zhao Jiuge before he shouted in disdain, “Bumpkin, don’t think you’re remarkable just because you won once. If I wanted to deal with you, it’d be easier than trampling an ant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled. He wasn’t angry at all. “Is that so? With your pathetic self? I can beat you once, I can beat you again. Like I said before, if you’re unconvinced, then let’s fight! What is a man acting like this for? Do you actually have one down there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had cursed without using any dirty words, causing people to burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression of the youth with the scar, who had been calm this whole time, finally changed. His face was filled with anger and he pointed at Zhao Jiuge, his teeth clenched. “You…” It looked like his lungs were going to explode, but he could not find a rebuttal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile in her eyes and the corner of her mouth curved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent surged inside the youth with the scar. If not for the rules of the sect, he would have already acted. Today was a rare chance for him to see the girl he always admired, but instead he had seen Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing flirting. How could he not be angry? That was why he had waited until the three instructors left to come and provoke them with a group of disciples from influential families. However, he didn’t expect Zhao Jiuge to not even give him the chance to show off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After more than a year of time, he had already stepped into the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. With the help of his family’s resources, he was confident in dealing with this bumpkin. He believed that he had only lost because he had been careless. Even now, when he saw that Zhao Jiuge was also at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm, he still didn’t consider Zhao Jiuge a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then let’s fight again just like you said. Do you dare? Let’s set it for today!” The youth with the scar’s eyes were filled with battle intent. He wanted to wash away the shame, he wanted to let everyone know that he was not weaker than Zhao Jiuge. After losing to Zhao Jiuge, he had suffered, and that thorn was still buried in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who knew that a few casual words from Zhao Jiuge would infuriate the youth with the scar so much that he felt like his blood was boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have already lost once, what’s there to challenge? This big brother doesn't have time to waste with you. The training exercise is going to start soon and I still have to prepare.” With The precious treasure-grade flying sword tempting Zhao Jiuge, he just wanted to prepare for the training so he could win. As for other things, they didn’t interest him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the youth with the scar about to go crazy from anger, Mu Zijun was afraid he would act on his impulse and violate the sect rules. This would affect their plan for the training, so he quickly pulled the youth with the scar back and stood between them. Lost pride could be recovered during the training, but if the plan for the training was affected, it would not be good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The training was going to involve the disciples of all three peaks, and the higher-ups would be watching. How could youths like them not feel their blood boil? Who wouldn’t want to show off before everyone? They wanted to take this chance to become famous across the sect. Many people thought like this, but they lacked the strength. However, these disciples from influential families were different. They were confident because their group had five Foundation Realm cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Jiu, it's been a long time since we met. I haven’t seen you ever since you were sent to the Ponder Sword Cliff. If I didn’t know better, I’d think you had gotten into an accident during a mission.” Mu Zijun had a smile on his face, but his words were like hidden needles. They had clearly seen each other outside the Duty Hall, but he purposefully brought up the Ponder Sword Cliff to remind Zhao Jiuge why he was sent there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Mu Zijun appear to change the topic, Zhao Jiuge didn’t mind. He didn’t want to cause too much trouble with the training only half a month away. If he got into a fight now, it would take a while for him to recuperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had a fake smile on his face while he looked at Mu Zijun. “Some people are better off not meeting too often. Also, you’re not a beautiful woman, why would I want to see you? Not to mention, even if there were any accidents during missions, it wouldn’t be me running into them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if he wanted to anger the youth with the scar and Mu Zijun, Zhao Jiuge’s right hand wrapped around Bai Qingqing’s waist while he was speaking. He immediately felt the softness in his hand, but he didn’t have the courage to pull Bai Qingqing into his arms. “See, I have a beautiful companion—do I need to meet you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression was calm and he had a smile on his face. However, he was worried that Bai Qingqing’s temper would erupt. Fortunately, Bai Qingqing didn’t erupt in anger. Instead, she smiled faintly and even leaned toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding people were all stunned. Bai Qingqing was undoubtedly the most stunning among the 20 or 30 or so female disciples in this generation. Not only was her face stunning, even her strength and the power of her family would make people ashamed of themselves. Now that she was acting so close to Zhao Jiuge, how could they not be shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge had a bitterness in his heart that he couldn’t express and had to pretend to be happy. He didn’t know what had possessed him to wrap his hand around that little lioness’ waist, but not only did she not counter attack, she was even being cooperative. This had to be the calm before the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with scar’s chest heaved up and down even more violently, and he felt like his brain was going to explode. He didn’t even bother to hide his ferocious and cold gaze that was locked onto Zhao Jiuge—he looked like he wanted to devour Zhao Jiuge whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun’s expression froze after Zhao Jiuge’s retort. Since things were already like this, he no longer pretended to keep up appearances. “Hmph, I came to discuss something with you. I say discuss, but I just want to tell you something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge didn’t speak, Mu Zijun paused a bit and continued, “This training exercise will have disciples from all three peaks participating. Since there are no rules, then only by gathering the strength of all the disciples on each peak will we be able to have an advantage. I know you have a lot of say among these people. During the training exercise, have your group follow us and help us deal with the disciples of the other peaks. Then each of you will naturally get 200 sect contributions. I believe most of you don’t even have a magic treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun put a special emphasis when he said the words “these people.” The more he spoke, the more his sense of superiority showed on his face. His tone and expression all revealed his contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge knew what kind of scheme they were playing—they wanted his group to act as cannon fodder. He sneered in his heart and stopped Leng Rufeng, who was about to erupt in rage. He smiled and softly said, “Quit dreaming, this is our own matter. We’ll each make our own plans. Don’t try to mess with our affairs because you’re not qualified.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun didn’t expect Zhao Jiuge’s words would be so simple and direct. He thought that the temptation of the 200 sect contributions was enough for these bumpkins, but he didn’t expect them to not care at all. He wanted to unite all the new disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak to fight for the flags against the other two peaks. Then his entourage would deal with the top disciples of the other two peaks. As a result, the Mysterious Heaven Peak would take the overall victory and they would become famous across the sect. However, Zhao Jiuge wouldn’t even give him the chance, and Zhao Jiuge had the strength and prestige among that group. If they couldn’t even deal with him, then how would they deal with the people behind him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun reluctantly said, “Zhao Jiuge, don’t be stubborn. We have a total of five Foundation Realm cultivators on our side. Look at your side—with you and Leng Rufeng, there are only two Foundation Realm cultivators. Even you are only at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. Do you really think you guys can achieve anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already reached the late stage of the Foundation Realm. The youth with the scar and Bai Zimo had already reached the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. Even Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger were at the early stage of the Foundation Realm. On the other side, Zhao Jiuge was at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm and Leng Rufeng was only at the early stage of the Foundation Realm. They were much more powerful than them, so why were they still acting so tough?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I not a person?” Bai Qingqing, who had been beside Zhao Jiuge, suddenly spoke with a smile that wasn’t a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, an uproar echoed. They hadn’t expected Bai Qingqing, who always preferred being alone, to support someone. These disciples knew from Bai Qingqing’s temperament, strength, and treasures that her family was definitely no weaker than theirs. However, she never interacted with them, so they couldn’t figure out why Bai Qingqing would support Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the expressions of Bai Zimo, Mu Zijun, and the youth with the scar froze up. They didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
