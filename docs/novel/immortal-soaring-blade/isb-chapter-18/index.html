 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Yao, who had a head of white hair, secretly felt relieved and his nervous eyes relaxed. Seven was not much, but refining seven Blue Spirit Pills from the Blue Moon Grass was not bad either. He let out a mouthful of foul air and his face looked haggard. “Longjie, ah, my task is complete, so I’m going to rest. Seven pills is not bad—at least this old man didn’t waste the spirit herb.” After saying that, he left regardless of everyone else’s reactions. In order to refine the Blue Spirit Pills, he had spent a full day and night here without rest. Some even more advanced herbs required days, and legend had it that some even required years of refining.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie slightly bowed to send Old Yao off. He gently put the Blue Spirit Pills into several jade bottles, and his eyes couldn’t help but be filled with excitement. With the Blue Spirit Pills, he might have a chance to reach the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at the blue-colored Blue Spirit Pills with curiosity in his eyes and subconsciously swallowed. This was the first time he had seen refined pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gave one Blue Spirit Pill to Old Mo and withdrew his excited expression. He took a deep breath and handed a jade bottle with three Blue Spirit Pills to Zhao Jiuge. “Jiuge, Uncle Mo will be taking advantage of you this time. You hold on to these three Blue Spirit Pills. Tomorrow, when I take you to the auction, I’ll definitely get you a satisfactory gift.” He was a bit embarrassed. After all, it was all due to Zhao Jiuge that they were able to obtain the Blue Spirit Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge revealed a large smile and scratched his hair before grabbing the jade bottle to take a closer look. “Out of the four remaining Blue Spirit Pills, both Old Mo and I will use one each to attempt to break through to the Foundation Realm. One will be left for that kid Shouyi. Jiuge I hope you will help look after Shouyi in the future.” After seeing Zhao Jiuge not saying anything, Mo Longjie continued to speak and didn’t forget to drop the intent of recruiting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhao Jiuge held the jade bottle, he was so excited that his breathing became rough. After hearing what Mo Longjie had said, his eyes were filled with expectation and he wanted to know what Mo Longjie would give him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second day, right at dawn, Mo Linger came to Zhao Jiuge’s room to wake him up. She couldn’t wait to go to the auction house. Whenever she saw Zhao Jiuge, her smile became even brighter. When Zhao Jiuge arrived in the courtyard following Mo Linger, he found that there were many people there already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie was still wearing the elegant, blue robe. Zheng Jie was whispering something to Mo Longjie, and behind him were seven to eight men in light, black armor holding blades. When he saw Zhao Jiuge and Mo Linger, Mo Longjie raised his brows and asked, “Is everything ready? Today, we are bringing a lot of people to prevent the Xiao family from causing trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Mo Longjie’s question, Zheng Jie leaned closer. “Family Head, everything is ready. All the people have been arranged.” His expression was serious and respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go. We're going to head over early.” Mo Longjie gently nodded and then looked at Zhao Jiuge and Mo Linger with a gentle expression. More than a dozen people left the Mo Mansion together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they walked through the bustling streets, Zhao Jiuge watched these mortals wake up early so they could work until night to make a living. He couldn’t help but feel melancholy. If he hadn’t found his teacher’s legacy, he would be just like them—busy day in and day out and then return to the earth after 100 years. Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they got closer to that alley, Zhao Jiuge felt the flow of people increase. He wondered what kind of auction could attract so many people. All the Spirit Detecting Realm cultivators setting up stalls had disappeared. All kinds of people in strange clothes disappeared behind the black curtain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge saw a lot of young men in light, black armor walking around the alley. These people were all people of the Mo family. Some had spirit force fluctuations and some were just ordinary people. It was still the same two people at the Blood Movement Realm guarding the door. When they saw Zhao Jiuge arrive with Mo Lingjie, they were surprised, but only for a moment. They quickly regained their cool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the door, the first floor was almost completely full, and at the front was a platform. Feeling the spirit force fluctuations here, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes widened and his brows furrowed. He was secretly shocked. Were all these people cultivators from near Dong Yang City? There were several people on the first floor that attracted Zhao Jiuge’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a messy-looking daoist holding a white whisk that looked like the daoist’s beard. He was sitting there smiling. His skin didn’t have any wrinkles and he didn’t look like he had aged at all. He also didn’t talk to anyone around him, and beside him was a red little dao child who had a lovely face. Zhao Jiuge was secretly shocked that he could not see through this daoist’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A square-faced burly man with a large beard, large eyebrows, and broad nose was excitedly talking to the people around him. His voice rang like a bell and traveled all the way to the door. Zhao Jiuge looked at the honest-looking burly man and was shocked by his spirit force fluctuations—late stage Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also a gloomy old man in the corner. He was as thin as dried branches and was wearing a mask. His exposed skin looked like dried-up farmland. The old man’s two eyes looked lifeless, but when Zhao Jiuge looked at the old man’s eyes, he felt his scalp tingle, like he was facing a poisonous scorpion. There was no one around the old man, as if he was a plague god, and the old man didn’t mind. Zhao Jiuge could feel that this old man was stronger than the daoist. Zhao Jiuge only felt this way when he saw the flood dragon that night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last was a middle-aged scholar in white who was gently waving a white fan and smiling at the people around him. His eyes lit up from time to time. Zhao Jiuge looked at the ordinary-looking fan and saw a flicker of light. His pupils shrank. It was a precious treasure and another late stage Spirit Transformation cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also some stronger people among the crowd with some guards around them. They were probably smaller families of Dong Yang City. None of them had the cultivation to attract Zhao Jiuge’s attention, but among one of the members of the small families was a young man around 18 years old. He was handsome, but his face was somewhat pale. However, his dark eyes were burning with passion as he stared at Mo Linger with undisguised affection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge’s mouth twitched. He didn’t think the little girl, Mo Linger, would be so popular. Mo Longjie came in and looked at the people here. After a while, his brows furrowed as he pondered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days had passed, but the Xiao family hadn’t reacted and hadn’t come today either. What exactly were they playing at? He slightly shook his head as he looked at the people from the Mo family stationed inside and outside. He pushed this thought out of his and led Zhao Jiuge and Mo Linger to the rooms on the second floor. Shortly after, Old Mo appeared on the platform with a kind smile and the room became quiet before people started to cheer. In an instant, the atmosphere of the auction house reached a peak.</span></p>
