 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

The person in front looked anxious, but when he saw that everyone hadn’t started fighting yet, he heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, we’re late.” The five people arrived beside Zhang Ping. The person in front respectfully bowed and revealed an apologetic look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan smiled gently and asked with some doubt, “No problem, you’re not too late. Ling Longbiao, you're right on time. What about Chen Jie?” Now that her people were here, she let out a breath of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao’s skin was white and tender and he was a little handsome—he was like a pretty boy. Hearing Zhang Pingquan’s question, he quickly answered, “The three of them are dealing with the disciples of the other two peaks and haven’t come up. I was afraid that the battle up here had begun and Senior Sister would be at a disadvantage, so I brought a few people up here to help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From Ling Longbiao’s words, it seemed like the Mysterious Strange Peak had three more Foundation Realm disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now they had nine people as well, while Zhao Jiuge only had three. They seemed to be lacking in terms of manpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weren’t you unconvinced before? Try keeping that attitude up! Would you believe me if I said I’m going to deal with your Mysterious Heaven Peak first?” Zhang Pingquan had a gloomy expression and smiled at Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Chen Gang, who was going to join them, remained silent and watched the situation. How that the Mysterious Strange Peak was almost all here, he didn’t need to join in. Preserving his strength was more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng stood in the back and cursed, “What the hell is that Mu Zijun doing? Where did he run off to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge pouted. “There is no way for them to be eliminated. Now that all the top disciples are here, they are just playing their own scheme. It’s inconvenient for them to directly deal with us, so they are using the other two peaks to deal with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been so long that if Mu Zijun’s group was going to come here, they would have reached the top already. If they weren’t going to come, then waiting for them would be pointless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing didn’t like seeing Zhang Pingquan acting like a little villain whose plan had succeeded. She calmly said, “I don’t believe you can, and I’m still unconvinced. What can you do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan’s eyes became cold and she said, “What can I do? Soon, you’ll know what I can do!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his senior sister angry, Ling Longbiao stepped forward and shouted, “We have nine people to deal with the three of you, yet you’re still so arrogant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So what if we are arrogant? My Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples are just more arrogant than your Mysterious Strange Peak disciples. If you got the skill, come and bite me. Not only are you ugly, you only came out here to try to scare people. If you have nothing to do, then scram back to your Mysterious Strange Peak to cultivate. What are you shouting for?” Zhao Jiuge was too lazy to stand out when it was just the two of them arguing. However, now that someone else stood out, he would not let others bully Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s final words were obviously directed at Zhang Pingquan. This angered her to the point of her teeth itching and her chest was heaving up and down. Zhao Jiuge’s words had poked directly at her heart. If not for this, she wouldn't have disliked Bai Qingqing from the get-go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the cold and angry Bai Qingqing was amused by Zhao Jiuge’s words and suddenly laughed. She was like a blooming flower, which formed a sharp contrast with Zhang Pingquan. It was like comparing heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the gathering of the three peaks seemed a bit chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will wait and do nothing. As long as it doesn’t endanger us, we’ll watch how things play out. I didn’t expect the Mysterious Strange Peak to be so strong and have a woman leading them. That means her strength can’t be underestimated, but she is not as ugly as Zhao Jiuge says,” Luo Bowen whispered into Chen Gang’s ear. At the end, he revealed a helpless smile and shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang didn’t deny his words. In the current situation, the Mysterious Strange Peak held the most dominant position because everyone listened to Zhang Pingquan. The Mysterious Fallen Peak was split into two sides, but before they dealt with the disciples of the other two peaks, they wouldn't fight amongst each other. The Mysterious Heaven Peak was in the worst situation. No matter how bad the Mysterious Heaven Peak was, they couldn’t only have three Foundation Realm cultivators. This meant only one thing: the grudge between the two sides was so large that they were willing to ignore the honor of the Mysterious Heaven Peak. This showed just how deep the grudge was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan’s breathing became rough and there was a ferocious gaze in her eyes. She revealed a cold smile. “Since your Mysterious Heaven Peak is so arrogant, then don’t blame the nine of us for bullying the three of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahahahaha,” Zhao Jiuge laughed loudly into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, his expression didn’t change. He looked at Zhang Ping and arrogantly said, “So what if you have nine people? My Mysterious Heaven Peak will fight three versus nine—what’s there to fear?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge gave off an unspeakable aura. He was now 17 years old and had grown much taller than before. His handsome face with his blue sword robe gave off a certain kind of temperament. His grandiose words made him appear very heroic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he pulled out the Blue Plum Sword, and blue light flickered from his sword. His spirit force gushed out and golden light filled the area. Not only was Zhao Jiuge not afraid, he was even showing signs of making the first move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words were still echoing in the air when Luo Bowen, Chen Gang, and the other disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak saw Zhao Jiuge’s actions. They couldn’t help but reveal looks of admiration!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s hair fluttered slightly from Zhao Jiuge’s aura. She smiled faintly and looked gently at the young man that continued to grow. She didn’t mind helping him, because no matter what, this youth also persisted and fearlessly moved ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Zhao Jiuge has this intent, then what do I have to fear? No matter how strong the enemy is, I, Bai Qingqing, will accompany you and show the might of my Mysterious Heaven Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the Wind Flower Sword hummed. Blue light shined on Bai Qingqing’s body and her blue sword robe fluttered without any wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, both of them were very dazzling. With the two of them standing side by side, they were like an immortal couple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Leng Rufeng was moved by Zhao Jiuge’s words and actions. Even though he was facing the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples that had several times their numbers, he was not afraid. He raised the grey flying sword in his hand and was ready to move at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three people formed an inverted triangle, ready to face off against the nine disciples from the Mysterious Strange Peak. Their aura was no weaker than the other side’s.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were seven people looking into the distance on the large rock. Jian Wuxian had remained silent from beginning to end. Even when the Mysterious Heaven Peak fell into a disadvantage, his expression didn’t change. It wasn’t until he heard Zhao Jiuge’s words that he couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the gloomy Jian Wuxie had a look of admiration in his eyes. No matter what, even if they lost in the end, they didn’t lose in terms of their aura!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s nice to be young. Even I can’t help but lose myself a bit to that stinky brat’s words. I can’t help but feel my blood boil,” Jian Wuxuan said softly, then he subconsciously looked at Du Jun. He had said this for a certain someone to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, still too young. A newborn calf that is not afraid of tigers,” Du Jun calmly said. “I don’t know how many disciples of the three peaks will catch our eye and participate in the Seven Holy Land Assembly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Xu pursed his lips. He smiled but didn’t speak. The current situation was not related to their Mysterious Fallen Peak, so he was too lazy to join in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soon, everything will be answered,” Jian Wuxian calmly said, and no one dared to say any more. Everyone focused on the situation on top of Wu Hua Peak. Jian Wuxian was, after all, the Head Teacher, ao they didn’t dare to be too unbridled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mysterious Heaven Peak Square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Light Mirror was already activated. Normally, this mirror would not be activated so easily. Only when the disciples of the peak participated in major events or if they went out to participate in some competition on behalf of the sect would it be activated. It was controlled by the elders and powered by spirit stones. The mirror allowed the lower level disciples to see the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Mysterious Light Mirror was showing the situation at the top of Wu Xua Peak. After Zhao Jiuge said those heroic words, the entire square erupted in cheers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Peak was filled with a sea of people. Not only was the square packed with people, there were a lot of inner sect disciples hovering in the air before the mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Wu Tianshan and Sha Sha were here. Basically every single disciple of the Mysterious Heaven Peak, inner or outer, that didn’t have anything particularly important to do were gathered here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all want to see who among the new generation of disciples was the most outstanding. Who would lead the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect to set off a wave among the Seven Holy Lands in the next hundred years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that this was the most lively the Mysterious Heaven Peak Square had been in recent years. This was because the rules were different this time, with all three peaks participating. It was no longer just an internal competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While everyone was cheering, they all looked closely at the mirror. They wanted to see if Zhao Jiuge’s group would be able to reverse the situation and defeat the nine disciples of the Mysterious Strange Peak to show the might of the Mysterious Heaven Peak, or if they would be defeated instead. Even if they were defeated, it would be an honorable defeat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The squares on the remaining two peaks were the same. They also had Mysterious Light Mirrors above their squares that were showing the same image. The difference was that the crowds consisted of disciples of their own peaks instead. All three peaks had about the same number of disciples, about 1,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The top of Wu Hua Peak was definitely the most dazzling place here today, attracting the attention of everyone in the sect. Even some of the elders who were in constant closed door cultivation had spread out their divine senses to observe as even they were a bit curious. After all, the new disciples were the lifeblood of the sect—they were very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, while everyone in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was watching, the situation on top of Wu Hua Peak changed—both sides made their moves!</span></p>
