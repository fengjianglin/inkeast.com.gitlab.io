 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

He must have gone to play with his new flying sword with the others. Zhao Jiuge smiled; he didn’t mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He arrived before his own wooden bed and felt fatigue wash over him. He didn’t even wash his clothes, he just sat down on his bed in his blood-stained robe. The spirit force in his body was completely exhausted and even his roots were a bit damaged. He had to quickly cultivate to recover and couldn’t worry about the fatigue he was feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time was precious for Zhao Jiuge; he had to grasp every minute and second. There were too many things for him to do. As the inner selection approached, the time when he could probe for information about Bo Re also closed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still clearly remembered that night and how that cold and noble woman in white had talked about the Hundred Flower Sword Art. Once he entered the inner sect, he was going to ask which sect that sword art belonged to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge felt a burst of passion in his heart and the fatigue he felt faded a little. He sped up his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Sanskrit Divine Body had become even more powerful and he now had three golden dragons. That was the first time he had used it and shown its power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been a while since he reached the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. When he began cultivating and absorbing spiritual energy, he found that he was showing signs of a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This surprised him a little. He thought about Su Su, that cold and noble figure, and other things in his heart before he gradually threw aside all distractions and focused on cultivation. The harder he worked, the closer he would come to that wonderful world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s breathing gradually became long and slow and he entered a state of cultivation. The surrounding spiritual energy poured into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed like this. Zhao Jiuge completely ignored what was happening outside and focused on cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun rose and set, but Zhao Jiuge remained motionless. If not for the fact that his chest would occasionally go up and down, one would think something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after seven days passed, Zhao Jiuge suddenly opened his eyes. After leaving the state of cultivation, Zhao Jiuge looked around, then he got off his wooden bed and moved his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of his mouth curved up into a smile. He was very satisfied with his current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vortex inside his dantian was rotating rapidly and his spirit force was showing signs of turning from gas to a solid!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once a solid formed, that would be his spirit core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the speed of the vortex in his dantian, he found a faint light and fog in the middle. This was a clear sign that he had reached the late stage of the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the series of battles on top of Wu Hua Peak, and with the help of Bai Qingqing’s Little Xuan Pill and seven days of cultivation, Zhao Jiuge had finally reached the late stage of the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only had his cultivation level increased, his body had recovered to its peak. Feeling very satisfied, he took out a dark-yellow jade tube.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the mission he had gotten after he returned from Yellow Flower Ridge, the mission to kill a late stage Foundation Realm spirit beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to spirit beasts’ powerful bodies, they could crush human cultivators at the same cultivation level. However, with him and Bai Qingqing together, there was no need to be afraid of this spirit beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge carefully checked the information recorded in the jade tube. Once he finished looking at the information, he was going to find Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, they didn’t have much time—there was less than half a year before the inner sect selection. And he still had to make sure his armor got refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After browsing the jade tube, Zhao Jiuge had a detailed understanding of the mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Profound Thunder Canyon, there was a Blue Thunder Rage Lion at the late stage of the Foundation Realm. Normally, this kind of spirit beast would not endanger the safety of people, so the sect generally would not actively hunt them. However, for some reason, this Blue Thunder Rage Lion had become very violent recently. It would often go out and kill the residents of the surrounding villages. It was found by the Enforcement Hall disciples and marked for elimination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area within the 500 kilometers of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was under its protection, but the Profound Thunder Canyon was not within this area. It was located in between the Xuan Providence and the Qing Providence. Only in this kind of place that was under no one’s control would there be a spirit beast going wild. However, it was still in the Xuan Providence and therefore fell under the jurisdiction of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why this mission was very dangerous—the location and the Blue Thunder Rage Lion were not the only dangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a higher chance for potential accidents. The further from the sect, the less deterrent the name of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was. Also, the higher the chance to encounter some powerful existences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since the Enforcement Hall was created in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, they had killed many devil doers, and a large number of disciples had died in these battles. Due to this, the hatred toward the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had built up. That was why once one was outside the range of influence of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, their identity as a disciple of the sect may bring a certain amount of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge had just undergone a small breakthrough to the late stage of the Foundation Realm and there was the mysterious Bai Qingqing. He was confident enough to face some accidents, not to mention he now had two precious treasure-grade flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a ripple of light before his chest and two flying swords appeared before him. They floated in the air and were surrounded by spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was green and one was silver. They were the two precious treasures he had gotten from the training. Only now did Zhao Jiuge have time to study these two swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One sword’s blade was very long and gave off a green glow. The handle had a red agate bead engraved inside. It was filled with a shocking amount of spirit force and was made of an unknown material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword was only two fingers wide and the edges were very thin but sharp. It gave off a cold aura intertwined with the light it gave off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This precious treasure was the Green Jade Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other’s blade was silver and the handle was azure, but the blade was only about one meter long. There were seven yellow thumb-sized star beads in the handle. The three colors complimented each other, making the Big-Dipper Sword seem even more brilliant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just looking at it, Zhao Jiuge really loved the Big-Dipper Sword. He put away the Green Jade Sword and carried the Big-Dipper Sword to find Bai Qingqing. They needed to discuss the mission and when to head out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, he didn’t have a single flying sword, but now he had more than he could use. However, a precious treasure was still not as good as a spirit treasure. Only a spirit treasure could be put into one’s dantian. Once you reached the Nascent Soul Realm, it would be nourished by your nascent soul. Only then could you control the sword as you wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the courtyard, Zhao Jiuge stepped onto the Big-Dipper Sword that was obviously better than the Blue Plum Sword. Zhao Jiuge had a smile on his face as he flew off toward Bai Qingqing’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was in a very good mood. When he saw the peaks hidden among the clouds, he felt a sense of pride surging in his heart. In half a year, he would be able to go to the various peaks and not be limited to just these few peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge felt a bit worried about Luo Xie. Both himself and Leng Rufeng had reached the Foundation Realm, only Luo Xie was still at the Spirit Transformation Realm. There wasn’t much time until the inner sect selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, he arrived at Bai Qingqing’s courtyard. As his cultivation level had increased and he had gained more practice with blade soaring, he was no longer as clumsy as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the spirit force fluctuations in the courtyard, Bai Qingqing walked out. Today, she was wearing a water-blue, sleeveless chiffon long dress and a green silk shawl around her shoulders. There was a hint of resentment in her eyes and she grumbled, “So you finally came. I thought you had changed your mind and no longer cared about sect contributions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled and observed the particularly alluring Bai Qingqing before he said, “How could that be? These resources are my life. Forget my life, I’m willing to do anything for them! Wasn’t I working hard cultivating for these past several days?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he released his late stage Foundation Realm aura. His face was filled with pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes and said, “What’s there to show off? It's just a mere breakthrough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled and crossed his arms. His eyes widened and he said, “You still don’t care? You’re also only at the late stage of the Foundation Realm. I have finally caught up to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I wanted to condense my spirit core, I would have long reached the Spirit Core Realm. It’s not that I don’t want to, isn’t it all for…” At this point, Bai Qingqing suddenly stopped talking. She almost let it slip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a flash of doubt in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes and he raised his brows. “For what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing. When are we heaving out? Also, what is the situation for this mission?” Bai Qingqing pretended to be calm, but there was a hint of panic in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the topic was changed to the important matter, Zhao Jiuge no longer continued questioning her. He lowered his head and took out the yellow jade tube, missing the panic in Bai Qingqing’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can head out now, it depends on whether you’re ready or not.” He threw the yellow jade tube at Bai Qingqing while he spoke. At the same time, he observed Bai Qingqing’s face. Although her face was still white, it was no longer that sickly white. Instead, there was a faint hint of red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I've been waiting for you for a few days. You tell me if I’m ready or not!” Bai Qingqing frowned, but her eyes were focused on the yellow jade tube.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then… We’ll head out today?” Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing questioningly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing ignored him and continued to look at the information inside the yellow jade tube.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished reading, she clenched the jade tube in her hand and said, “Let’s go today. The earlier we leave, the sooner we come back. This old lady is busy, I have much to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her expression was playful, her posture was charming, and her temperament was alluring. Zhao Jiuge just unblinkingly stared at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing anger gradually appear on her face, Zhao Jiuge quickly withdrew his gaze and quickly changed the topic. “Are you confident in dealing with the Blue Thunder Rage Lion?” His previously dumbfounded expression from staring at Bai Qingqing became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing faintly said, “There shouldn’t be any big problems with the two of us, as long as there are no accidents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge seemed a bit absentminded. He pretended to nod and then muttered, “That’s good… but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked curiously at Zhao Jiuge and asked, “But what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But you are looking really beautiful today, and I really like your outfit. I wonder if you knew I was coming today and purposely dressed up.” Zhao Jiuge burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because there was too big of a leap in logic between his words, Bai Qingqing couldn’t react at all. She frowned and pondered the situation. Zhao Jiuge took advantage of this and jumped onto the Big-Dipper Sword and flew off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only now that Bai Qingqing reacted to Zhao Jiuge teasing her. She clenched her teeth and angrily shouted, “If this old lady doesn’t show her might, will you just think I’m a sick cat? See how I deal with you once I catch up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing angrily chased after Zhao Jiuge on her Wind Flower Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky above the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, there was a young man flying through the sky with a young girl chasing him. Occasionally, laughter could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them flew toward the Profound Thunder Canyon.</span></p>
