 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them rushed through the unmarked graves one after the other, making their way through this terrifying place. Su Su carefully followed Zhao Jiuge toward the source of the spirit force fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It can’t be a Spirit Treasure awakening, right?” Zhao Jiuge asked happily. He had learned from the jade tube that there was a type of treasure called Spirit Treasure that was born from heaven and came with a spirit. When it was born, there would be a flash of bright light in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su was originally a bit afraid of the surroundings when she pouted and rolled her eyes. “Can you have a little common sense? Forgot about how difficult a Spirit Treasure is to find, that spirit force fluctuation was too small. I guess it's most likely some ghost or wild monster cultivating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but reveal an embarrassed expression and then calm down. The unknown was the most terrifying. He was never taught by anyone, so it was inevitable that there were a lot of things he didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The closer they got, the more visible the green light became. Even the naked eye could see the green smoke shrouding the air, and the smell of corpses filled the air. Zhao Jiuge frowned as he carefully stared ahead and walked forward in front of Su Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he placed the blue light sword before his chest. He surged the little spirit force he had left and filled his body with strength. This allowed him to relax his nervous heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what surprised Zhao Jiuge was that Su Su also used her spirit force. A faint light protected her body. After both of them used their spirit force, Su Su’s nervous expression disappeared and she returned to her normally haughty and lively self. Watching Zhao Jiuge stand before her, guarding her, made her beautiful brows furrow. She looked at him meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt Su Su’s spirit force but found that he couldn’t see through her cultivation. She probably had some magical treasure that could hide her cultivation. He shook his head and didn’t think about it anymore as he carefully walked forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhao Jiuge walked ahead, he found that many coffins were exposed on the surface. The paint on some of the coffins had already worn off and the stench of mold and rot became even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The coffins formed layers of circles. Some coffins were tilted and some were empty. Some of the coffins had edges missing due to time, revealing the bodies inside. The clothes were broken and the flesh was rotten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The further the two walked, the more quiet their breathing became—it was as if there was a big hand holding their hearts. This strange scene created an oppressive atmosphere. All of the coffins leaned toward the center, which was sunken in. There was a big pit in the middle, and the green light was coming from here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two got closer and closer without hiding their footsteps. Bright spirit light surrounded their bodies without hiding their presence at all. As if something had noticed their arrival, the green smoke in the air stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge and Su Su stopped around the coffins and stared at the sunken ground. If anything happened, they could react immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shrill laugh suddenly echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green smoke around the sunken hole gradually disappeared and then a skinny figure appeared. It was more appropriate to describe it as a dried-up corpse than a person. His hands and face were like dying tree branches, with only bone and skin. He wore a black robe that clung to his body, and the nails on his hands and feet were black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his face was skinny and dried up, it was very white, but not bright in an unhealthy way. It was as if he had poured boxes of white powder on his face. His eyes were dark and cold. His lips were red like blood and he had a strange expression as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The looks of the person that suddenly appeared, along with the strange clothes, made Zhao Jiuge and Su Su suck in a breath of cold air. Both were very young and therefore hadn’t experienced much. Zhao Jiuge was a bit better though. After all, he had a beauty with him, so he endured the fear. However, Su Su let out a soft cry and stepped back. She grabbed Zhao Jiuge’s sleeve and hid behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the young man and girl before him, the skinny man stuck out his tongue in disgust. He then licked his lips and had a salivating look as he observed their not-too-strong cultivation. “I didn’t expect such delicacies to deliver themselves to me, and cultivators to boot. Your blood essence must be 100 times richer.” His voice was very sharp, as if he had a fish bone stuck in his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the skinny man’s words, Zhao Jiuge’s pupils shrank and he couldn’t help but feel creeped out. He roared in uncertainty, “Evil cultivator!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bleh, just he can be considered an evil cultivator? That’s giving him too much credit!” At this moment, it was Su Su who had a disdainful expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, there is also a pretty little sister. He he he, and also a virgin too. Your blood essence must be even more delicious, let’s start with you.” As his words echoed, he swooped down with a creepy smile on his face. There were strands of faint, green smoke around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the skinny man rush over, Zhao Jiuge didn't hesitate to slash with this sword. Without any idea about how strong the man was, he could only test the man’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a crisp sound of metal colliding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge found that the long sword that was originally covered in blue light had become a little grey and there was a thin layer of grey smoke around it. However, he had no time to think, as the skinny man immediately pounced at him. Zhao Jiuge raised his sword to block the skinny man’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bing, clank…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The sounds of impacts echoed. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge found that the skinny man’s dark nails were now as sharp as claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they fought, Zhao Jiuge found more and more grey smoke surrounding his sword, and the spirit light of the sword was becoming more and more dim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp sound echoed and the blue sword broke in half. The half that fell on the ground was covered in grey smoke. When the smoke came in contact with the ground, all the surrounding grass withered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his weapon broken, the skinny man’s right hand clawed at Zhao Jiuge’s left shoulder and left a large wound. Strangely, although the skin was broken, no blood flowed out. The wound was grey and gave off a smell of decay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s expression changed greatly. During the exchange, he had noticed that there was something strange about the spirit force coming from this skinny man. The skinny man was also at the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, but even though he was injured, Zhao Jiuge should not be losing. There were also strands of the grey smoke that constantly required his attention to use extra spirit force to counter act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s shocked expression, the skinny man couldn’t help but look proud and let out a cold snort. “Now you know how strong I am. I cultivate the Corpse Gather Chant, where I absorb the aura from corpses to mix with the spirit force in my body. Thus, my spirit force also contains a hint of corpse aura.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny man was not wrong, but what he didn’t know was that cultivating the Corpse Gather Chant also consumed his own blood essence. That was why every now and then, he would have to absorb the blood essence of a living person. That was why everyone who cultivated the Corpse Gather Chant would end up in this inhuman state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything in the world had spirits, and there are all kinds of strange cultivation methods that could cause different attributes to appear in one’s spirit core. Some cultivation methods were too trash to even form a spirit core, which was the most important thing for a cultivator’s future. Cultivating was defying the heavens, one would have to be careful. While going down the crooked path allowed one to become stronger faster, there was always a trade-off. It usually resulted in physical imperfections or mental distortion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was injured, so his face was a bit pale, and the grey smoke continued to drill into his body, forcing him to use his own spirit force to repel it. However, he was not too worried about his injuries. His main concern was how to deal with the skinny man before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked to his side and saw Su Su behind him, enjoying watching him having a hard time. She had a big smile and didn’t seem to want to come forward to help at all. When she noticed Zhao Jiuge’s gaze, she put a “come and beg me for help” look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a cold snort in his heart. He was a man, and he had his own pride. Although Su Su was not so cold-hearted that she would just watch him die, he had his own principles. He no longer looked at Su Su but stared at the skinny man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just at this moment, the skinny man pounced at him like the wind, leaving a trail of debris flying into the air. His hands were like sharp claws that glistened in the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge ignore her like a donkey and getting really going to just face the skinny man head-on, Su Su couldn’t help but sigh. She became impatient at how dumb Zhao Jiuge was and shouted, “Hey, block head, don’t you have a flag magical treasure? Use that to deal with him.”</span></p>
