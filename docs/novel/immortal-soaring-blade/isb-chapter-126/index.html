 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

They were also divided into different species. When Zhao Jiuge was fighting the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, the zombie the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder had was one species. The Ten Thousand Corpse Elder had used a secret method to refine it into a puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world was vast and there was no lack of strange things. All life was created by spiritual energy, so everything was closely related to spiritual energy. Nothing could survive without spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhao Jiuge looked at the zombie before him, his pupils shrank. It turned out to be a Green Haired Zombie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he faced the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder with Su Su, the zombie they fought was only the lowest rank, one that relied only on its body and didn’t have any spirit force. It was already so difficult to deal with, and this Green Haired Zombie was even stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its body was like an ordinary person’s, but its clothes were a mess and were stained with blood. Some of the blood was dry and some was fresh. The moonlight shone on its body, revealing its features. Its skin was dark, its limbs were stiff, and its fingers were long. Although its nails were curved, they were very sharp. Some of its hair had turned green.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of zombie had begun to eat humans and would not let the animals people raised go. There were even fluctuations of spirit force coming from its body! Although it had just started to cultivate, its body was very tough and it was not afraid of people in the same cultivation range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Green Haired Zombie stiffly walked into the property and then stopped moving. Zhao Jiuge was secretly nervous as he didn’t have much practical experience. He was wondering why the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery hadn’t made a move yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie that was motionless suddenly moved. Its head turned slightly and then stopped moving again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge saw the Green Haired Zombie move once, he nervously readied the Blue Plum Sword in his hand. His spirit force was already surging for an attack, but the Green Haired Zombie stopped moving again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie turned its head and sniffed with its nose like it was enjoying the smell. Through the moonlight, Zhao Jiuge could clearly see that the Green Haired Zombie’s eyes were not hollow, but were slightly moving. After reaching the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, the Green Haired Zombie had gained intelligence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge sucked in a breath of cold air. If the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery wasn’t here, Zhao Jiuge would not be confident in facing this Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie’s eyes rotated and its stiff legs took it inside the yard. It stopped before the lamp and greedily smelled the stench coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery made his move. A ray of silver light flew across the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver light flashed by it instantly. Borrowing this short moment, Zhao Jiuge saw the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery step forward with a disk in his hand. The silver light came from that disk and shot toward the Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miserable cry that would make anyone shake echoed in the night sky. The people who had been awakened by the chickens and dogs became even more scared of coming out to check what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the light in the entire yard was lit up. The little Daoist boy had lit up all the lanterns in the yard. The Green Haired Zombie squealed and its body trembled. There was a large wound on its back. The flesh was rotting and a foul smell was leaking from the wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smell became even more unpleasant. Because of Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation, he was fine, but ordinary people would already be poisoned by this stench. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery already made his move, but Zhao Jiuge was still startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t until the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery moved again that Zhao Jiuge reacted. After the first attack hit, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery closed in and arrived behind the zombie in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Green Haired Zombie was completely enraged. The burning feeling it felt, combined with its newly gained intelligence, made it want to kill this person in front of it. Also, this old Daoist smelled different from ordinary people. The old Daoist’s blood smelled much more delicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Green Haired Zombie also reacted. It turned and its two hands reached out. Sharp nails swept toward the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery saw the Green Haired Zombie’s reaction, he was shocked and was covered in cold sweat. Before, the Green Haired Zombie’s movements seemed to slow, but after being attacked, it started moving so fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he know that some zombies could fly and that the legendary ones could be compared to immortals?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the sharp nails were about to stab into his neck, his heartbeat seemed to slow down. Then he subconsciously shook the whisk in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The whisk was as white as snow and shined as it flew through the air. This was one of the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s treasures, and it was much better than his other treasures. It was a precious treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the whisk moved, each strand moved like a silver snake and instantly wrapped around the hands of the Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After its hands were tied together, the Green Haired Zombie howled and tried to pull its hands free. It jumped up and down, pulling at the whisk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had a serious expression. He had his disk in one hand and was pulling the whisk with the other hand. He injected spirit force into the whisk so the Green Haired Zombie couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was startled when the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery made a move, but when the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery closed in, he reacted. He raised the Blue Plum Sword in his hand and released the powerful spirit force inside his body, causing the Blue Plum Sword to shine brightly. Normally, Zhao Jiuge would have already gone in for close combat, but he lacked actual combat experience and the Green Haired Zombie was simply too disgusting. Zhao Jiuge subconsciously chose to use the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art, and his sword struck out a few times, sending a few rays of blue sword energy toward the Green Haired Zombie’s sharp nails.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After launching the attack, who would have thought that the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery would wrap the zombie’s hands with the whisk? The blue sword energy landed on the strands from the whisk instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation where the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery and the Green Haired Zombie were pulling at each other suddenly broke. The white light around the whisk immediately dimmed after being hit by Zhao Jiuge’s sword energy, allowing the zombie to break free. The zombie also felt pain from its hands, and it instinctively opened its mouth. Foul, black gas spewed out from its mouth and landed on the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery, who was the closest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the Green Haired Zombie’s hand smashed into the whisk, sending the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery flying. This showed just how powerful the physical body of the zombie was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he had caused more problems when he tried to help, Zhao Jiuge felt ashamed. Before he could ask how the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was, Zhao Jiuge felt dizzy. He realized that the gas was poisonous! He immediately held his breath and began cycling his spirit force, which made him feel better.</span></p>

Be careful what you do, or else both of us are finished.” It took the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery a while to get back up. He was a mess and he cursed at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One couldn’t blame the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery for being angry. It was fortunate that he was experienced and immediately protected his face with spirit force. Otherwise, he would have lost half his life to the poison. Also, being hit by the Green Haired Zombie was not good, so now his internal energy was a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such a short period of time, ⅓ of his spirit force had been wasted. Most of it was consumed when Zhao Jiuge’s sword strikes landed on his whisk; the rest was him protecting his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was in an extremely sorry state. His eyes were filled with anger as he stared at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge embarrassedly chuckled and said, “I didn’t mean to. Who would expect you to suddenly wrap your whisk around its claws? Let’s deal with the zombie first, we can talk about the other stuff later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery let out a snort when he realized that Zhao Jiuge didn’t seem to be lying. He no longer looked at the zombie and began using the disk without any regard for the spirit force it would consume. However, before he had the chance, the Green Haired Zombie moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Zhao Jiuge speak, the Green Haired Zombie followed the sound and rushed toward Zhao Jiuge. From its memory, it knew Zhao Jiuge was the one who had injured its hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ordinary zombies’ limbs were stiff, but this Green Haired Zombie was no ordinary zombie. When it was angry, it moved as fast as a tiger. Zhao Jiuge was shocked by the zombie’s speed and was a bit overwhelmed. He barely had any combat experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt that he couldn’t run, hide, or let it close in. After all, he had seen how strong the Green Haired Zombie was. He could smell the rotting flesh, and Zhao Jiuge clenched his teeth. First, he used his spirit force to form a palm and smashed toward the zombie. Then, disregarding how much spirit force he was using, he began brandishing the Blue Plum Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palm made of spirit force first collided with the Green Haired Zombie. The Green Haired Zombie only stopped for a moment, but its previous injuries became worse. However, its powerful body kept moving forward, but when it saw the sky filled with sword energy, the Green Haired Zombie stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After it stopped, it suddenly released black spirit light that was like silk. It then jumped in the air and did a roll, its spirit force following. The Green Haired Zombie actually used spirit force as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Green Haired Zombie stopped, the white light from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s disk arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the black light from the zombie, Zhao Jiuge’s sword light, and the white light from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery all collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, black, blue, and white blended together. The three colors illuminated the night sky.</span></p>
