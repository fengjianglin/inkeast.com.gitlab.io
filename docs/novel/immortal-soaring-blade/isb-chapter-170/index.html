 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing? You scared me! Why can’t you come from the front? You had to sneak u p behind me to scare me.” When she saw it was Zhao Jiuge, Bai Qingqing heaved a sigh of relief. Then she rolled her eyes and moved a few strands of her hair behind her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Bai Qingqing acting like this, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t get used to it. What would make a brilliant girl like Bai Qingqing be weighed down by so much worry? Zhao Jiuge’s heart ached and he was very worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at this alluring girl with a complicated expression. In the past, she would have erupted in anger and would have a tight grip on his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Zhao Jiuge’s mouth curved up into a dull smile. Then he quickly opened his mouth to quip, “I didn’t expect your feminine side to be so charming. If my will wasn’t so strong, I would have fallen for you. I say, can’t you be more gentle and not always erupt in anger like a little lioness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, Bai Qingqing revealed a smile that meant “you will have to pay with your life tomorrow” and affectionately looked at Zhao Jiuge. However, there was a trace of coldness in her eyes as she tenderly said, “Is this smile the most feminine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Zhao Jiuge saw Bai Qingqing’s expression, he realized that it wasn’t good. Sure enough, before he could react, a sharp pain came from his ear. It was so painful that his expression became distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort, then she raised her tender arm and pulled Zhao Jiuge’s ear. The brilliant smile like the summer flower had long disappeared. The corner of her mouth curved up and she looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile that wasn’t a smile. She scolded, “Is it because this old lady has been too good to you that you feel a bit uncomfortable? Are you itching for a beating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the pain, Zhao Jiuge revealed a bitter smile, he had really lifted a stone and smashed his own foot. He originally wanted to joke with Bai Qingqing and make her smile. Who knew she would suddenly change like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s painful expression and bitter smile, Bai Qingqing could no longer hold back her laughter. The coldness on her face disappeared. It was like the sun had appeared and melted all the ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This smile made Zhao Jiuge feel like the surrounding scenery lost its color. This felt like the Bai Qingqing he knew—someone who wasn’t worried about anything and was not afraid of anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was worth it to make a friend smile like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked at Zhao Jiuge and asked, “Where were you for the last two days? I didn’t see you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge calmly said, “I spent the last two days cultivating. Isn’t there a training session soon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing raised her brow. “Did you pick up the mission? Not going to do the mission or refine the armor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The armor will have to wait for a while. After we kill the late stage Foundation Realm spirit beast, we might get some materials from its body. As for the mission, I wanted to ask you. I’m afraid that there won’t be enough time to make it back for the training.” Just thinking about these matters made Zhao Jiuge a bit restless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing lowered her head slightly. After pondering a bit, she said, “That’s fine, we can go after the training. Even if there aren’t enough materials, I believe you should have enough sect contributions to complete it. Refine the armor first. As for the flying sword, it can come later. An armor can ensure your safety. After all, in the future, you will have to depend on yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge nodded, but he was a bit surprised by Bai Qingqing’s words. He felt like something was off about what she had said, as if there was some hidden meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, he suddenly remembered the doubt in his mind. Zhao Jiuge hesitated and cautiously said, “Qingqing, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ask,” Bai Qinging answered simply, very straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have something on your mind or encountered some problem? If there is anything wrong, you can tell me about it and I’ll see if I can help.” Zhao Jiuge struggled a bit to finish the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s expression froze. She didn’t expect Zhao Jiuge to suddenly ask this. However, the matter in her heart was not something she could tell Zhao Jiuge about, and it was not something he could help with. She put on a big smile to show that she was fine. “Nothing to worry about, just a bit tired. Or do you think that I secretly fell in love with you because you’re so handsome?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge noticed Bai Qingqing’s forced expression. However, since she wasn’t willing to talk, Zhao Jiuge wouldn’t force it. However, no matter what difficulties Bai Qingqing was facing, he would not hesitate to stand up and help her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their flirty gestures were noticed by others in the square, and most people were more or less jealous. Bai Qingqing was undoubtedly the most stunning among the new disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away, a figure coldly looked at the two of them with teeth clenched. This person had a cold expression and a scar on his face. This was the youth with the scar that had lost to Zhao Jiuge back then. He was taken to be treated by the instructor, and when he came back, Zhao Jiuge was in confinement. Later, they all went out on missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was whispering with Bai Zimo, Mu Zijun, and several other disciples from influential families. While they were talking, they would occasionally look over at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, who were happily talking, they didn’t pay attention to the other people here. As time passed, more and more people gathered, then the three instructors appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The noise slowly dissipated with the appearance of the three instructors, everyone turned toward the instructors. Right now almost all the new disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak were here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples scattered across the corners of the square moved forward. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing didn’t walk up into the crowd but remained slightly behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aside from seven of the new disciples that haven’t returned in time from their missions, all the new disciples are here. You all know that the purpose of this gathering is to learn about the training before the inner sect selection.” Instructor Zhou’s voice was amplified by spirit force and spread across the entire square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Instructor Zhou finished speaking, his gaze swept across the silent square and then he continued, “This training is your chance to show off and verify your two years of progress at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. This training won’t just include our Mysterious Heaven Peak. The new disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak and the Mysterious Strange Peak will participate with you. Most importantly, the higher-ups of the sect will be observing too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those last words were spoken, a huge wave was set off across the square. Every disciple’s eyes were burning with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you hear? Even the higher-ups will be watching!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who cares if they watch or not? What are you getting excited for? I’m more curious about the situation of the new disciples from the other two peaks.”</span></p>

Otherwise, I will have no chance of reaching the Foundation Realm in time. I won’t be able to enter the inner sect at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, everyone was talking and sharing their own thoughts and goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhao Jiuge was moved. He didn’t think an ordinary training session would attract the attention of so many people. Only Bai Qingqing remained unmoved by this news. She seemed to be thinking about something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two instructors smiled while they watched the disciples’ excited reactions. Instructor Lu stepped forward and gestured everyone to quiet down. He stroked his beard and smiled. “The location of the training is at the Wu Hua Peak. The disciples of all three peaks will be sent there and will be scattered. Each of you will have a colorful flag, and the winner will be whoever has the most flags. The rule of this training is that there are no rules—you can fight one-on-one or in groups. The only thing that matters is the result. However, you’re not allowed to take anyone’s life, and there will be someone observing the training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one had expected the training exercise to be throwing everyone into one peak and having them compete for flags. The big fish would eat the small fish and the small fish would eat the shrimps. All the flags would slowly gather together until they all fell into the hands of one person. The rules were very intriguing, because only the result mattered, not the means. That meant that having more people was an advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After giving everyone time to digest the news, Instructor Li’s next words set off everyone here once more. The atmosphere reached a boiling point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The faction that wins will earn 200 sect contributions for all the disciples in their faction. The three people with the most flags will each receive a precious treasure-grade flying sword. The order of the ranking determines who gets first pick.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Precious treasure grade flying sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused the blood of many of the new disciples who didn’t even have a magic treasure to boil. Their breathing became rough and they stared at the three instructors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but hold his breath. His eyes widened and his expression froze. When Bai Qingqing saw him like this, she wanted to laugh but felt it wouldn’t be right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the 200 sect contributions that everyone would get, this caused the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak to feel a sense of unity. It has to be said that 200 sect contributions was enough to buy a magic treasure-grade flying sword. The sect used this kind of training exercise to encourage disciples to work hard and distribute some resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have you all heard the rules of this training? Is there anyone who still doesn't understand?” Instructor Zhou’s words spread across the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that no one raised any questions, Instructor Zhou nodded in satisfaction. “Very good. During the training, don’t lose face for our Mysterious Heaven Peak. If you encounter disciples of the other peaks, beat them until they hand over their flags. Of course, you’re not allowed to kill anyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou’s final words caused the tense atmosphere to disappear and everyone erupted in laughter. No one had expected the serious Instructor Zhou to say such childish things. Even the two other instructors seemed amused, and the corners of their mouths curved up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, since you all understand, there is nothing more. All of you get back to cultivating for the next half-month. If any of you embarrass our peak during training, then just wait for me to deal with you.” Afterward, Instructor Zhou waved his hand and backed toward the other two instructors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Lu and Instructor Wang glanced at the disciples on square once more before all three of them flew away, leaving behind the disciples still processing the information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s expression was relaxed and leisurely. She raised her head slightly and said to Zhao Jiuge, “Since we aren’t going out for the next half month, then let’s properly cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I’ll have to properly prepare. I wasn’t interested before, but now that I know that there is a precious treasure-grade flying sword as a reward, I have to get top three!” Zhao Jiuge’s eyes glowed. Due to his excitement, even his face was a bit red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes at Zhao Jiuge and frustratedly said, “Look at you, satisfied with so little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, she moved aside a few strands of her hair and then continued, “But I’ll still help you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked like a young couple flirting with each other. Someone on the other side of the square was watching all of this with jealousy and viciousness in their eyes. As a result, a group of people walked over.</span></p>
