 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver moon was like a hook, and the moonlight illuminated everything. A few crows quietly jumped onto the dead tree branches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking forward, the field was covered in mounds of unmarked graves that covered the path before him. Zhao Jiuge swallowed and thought there had to be at least 1,000 graves. Some the coffins were showing under the dirt, while others were covered in wild grass that swayed in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Caw, caw.” The crows occasionally cried a few times as the night breeze blew, causing the yellow grass around the grave to roll around the earth as if there were ghosts wandering nearby. Zhao Jiuge trembled and felt a chill as everything was too creepy. His hand clenched the sword and even turned white because he was clenching too hard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!” A whisper suddenly came from behind him, and even the jungle behind him seemed to shake. This sudden sound was like the messenger from hell, and it caused Zhao Jiuge to break out in a cold sweat. His teeth trembled slightly and he swallowed hard to force himself to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought about how everything in the world had a spirit; even the mountains and rivers had their own souls. All of these things were born from absorbing spiritual energy from the world; even he himself was like this since he embarked on the path of cultivation, so what was there to be afraid of? With this thought in mind, Zhao Jiuge felt a lot better. After all, he was still young. He suppressed the fear in his heart and held onto his long sword as he slowly walked forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart tightened as he pushed open the bushes with his left hand. After looking behind the bush, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes widened and his mouth opened wide to let out a cry. Then his body staggered back a step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Zhao Jiuge’s cry, there was another cry from the bush. It was that girl from Dong Yang City. It seemed that she had followed Zhao Jiuge out of curiosity all the way from Dong Yang City. Then, when the moonlight shined, she also saw the unmarked graves. As a girl, she was timid and couldn't help but let out a cry. This led to Zhao Jiuge suddenly finding her, causing him to let out a cry. The two people were scaring each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only at this moment did Zhao Jiuge get a good look at her. She was a girl about 15 or 16 years old with a delicate face, and her dark eyes were particularly lively. Her exquisite nose and red lips, combined with her long, black, silk dress, formed a strong contrast with her white skin. She was so beautiful that one would not dare to look directly at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bo Re was a snow lotus on an iceberg that was so noble and cold, no one would dare to approach it. You loved it and hated it, but it also would make people jump forward to their death like a moth to a flame. This girl before him was more like a green lotus in the summer—very lively and clean, and could grow in mud but not be stained by the mud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was startled when he saw a girl with a temperament to match Bo Re’s, even though she was still a girl. For a moment, he was startled and just stared at her like an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl also recovered and calmed herself. Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s lustful gaze, she rolled her eyes and shouted, “What are you looking at? Never seen a beautiful girl before?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the girl’s cry, Zhao Jiuge withdrew his passionate gaze. His breathing was a bit short, his teeth clattered, and his body trembled. Seeing a beautiful woman with such white skin in a place like this made Zhao Jiuge subconsciously blurt out, “You… Are you a person or a ghost?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl was already not happy when her brows suddenly furrowed and she angrily shouted at Zhao Jiuge, “Have you ever seen such a beautiful ghost!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a laugh and felt a bit embarrassed. He played with his hair a bit before turning to proudly look at the girl. He pursed his lips and said, “I haven’t seen any pretty ghosts, but I once met a woman, and I fear that no one that can compare with her has been born.” As he spoke, he thought about that night at the cold pool. That noble posture, that long, fluttery hair, that plain dress, and that cold yet proud temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women were terrifying creatures of vanity. After she heard Zhao Jiuge’s words and watched him immerse himself in his memories, she let out a cold snort. Her beautiful eyes turned and then she extended her neck like a proud swan. “Oh, I couldn’t tell that a little boy like you was already a pervert. Are you talking about the girl that went shopping with you? I don’t think she is much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words caused Zhao Jiuge’s face to turn rose red, but Zhao Jiuge was no longer the shy, little boy he was when he met Bo Re. He calmed himself and explained that Mo Linger was only his little sister. Then he told the girl before him about what happened at the cold pool, about how strong and noble Bo Re was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was still describing, but he had a smile on his face as if he was introducing his favorite toy—he was very proud. He didn’t realize how ugly the expression of the girl before him had become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl finally stretched her neck as she looked at Zhao Jiuge with a playful smile and said, “Look at you, praising her like that. I want to have a chance to see what kind of woman has you hypnotized so. But too bad she doesn’t care about you.” After saying that, she looked at Zhao Jiuge playfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was hit where it hurt in his heart, and his smile gradually disappeared. His face became completely calm, without any emotions. He just remained silent, and no one knew what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s reaction, the girl stuck out her tongue. Her delicate and beautiful face revealed an apologetic look and she carefully said to Zhao Jiuge, “I’m sorry, what I said was wrong. Let us get to know each other, my name is Su Su.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a large mouthful of air and his eyes lit up. “No problem, what you said is not wrong. However, looking into the future, no one remains unchanging. As long as one puts in the effort, I believe nothing is impossible in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Zhao Jiuge’s uplifting words, she felt like this youth had changed a little from before. As for what had changed, she didn’t know, and her beautiful eyes carefully observed this youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was slightly taller than her, with a handsome face and dark eyes filled with self-confidence. His long hair was casually tied with a ribbon that fluttered in the night wind, and his faint smile was very infectious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s eyes shined brightly and a trace of red appeared on her delicate face. The two silently looked at each other, and neither chose to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about Su Su’s words, Zhao Jiuge secretly pondered and took the lead to speak. “Su Su, have we met somewhere before?” After understanding the situation, Zhao Jiuge guessed that the person following him back at Dong Yang City and giving him the strange feeling of being followed was Su Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su gently nodded and pointed at Zhao Jiuge’s waist. Zhao Jiuge followed Su Su’s gaze to see the jade pendant his grandfather had given him. He held the jade pendant in his hand and asked, “Su Su, is there something wrong with this jade pendant?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jade pendant was ink black, and on it was the carving of an unknown animal. The head of a dragon, body of a horse, and legs of a qilin, but it had the shape of a lion. “This was given to me by my grandfather before he died. I don’t know what it is.” After that, his eyes dimmed as he thought about the old man who had adopted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The animal is a Pi Xu. Outside the auction, I felt the fluctuations from the jade and felt like it was a little familiar. As for the specifics, I don’t know, but it’s something good, so don’t lose it. Then I became curious and decided to follow you.” After she finished speaking, she paused for a moment and stared at the jade pendant with a curious gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Su’s eager eyes, Zhao Jiuge handed the jade pendant to her Su Su carefully examined it in her hand and softly said, “Are you not afraid I’ll take it?” After that, she smiled at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Su’s teasing gaze, Zhao Jiuge pretended to be vicious. “Try it if you dare. This is the wilderness. Hmph, you know what I mean.” He laughed after he finished speaking, a complete change to the fear he had felt before. The laughter echoed through this desolate place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, who wants your jade pendant? This miss can have whatever she wants, who cares about your jade pendant?” She pouted and spoke as if she didn’t care. After a while, she seemed to remember something and said, “But I secretly escaped, so my family doesn’t know. It's too boring at home—it's just cultivating day in and day out. The outside world is more interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s mouth twitched a bit. This girl was a little older than him, but she was very strange. She was filled with spirit force and had many strange ideas—a bit of a headache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An invisible spirit force came from the distance, causing Su Su and Zhao Jiuge to look over. In the distance, a dazzling ray of green light appeared over the graves. The yellow soil was still churning as the sound of resentment came from the source of the light. Everything was just so strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su and Zhao Jiuge looked at each other and their eyes widened. In the end, it was Zhao Jiuge who softly said, “Let us go check it out.”</span></p>
