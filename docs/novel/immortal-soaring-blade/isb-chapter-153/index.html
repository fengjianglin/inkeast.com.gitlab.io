 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Generally, a formation needed a formation disk and formation flags to operate. The formation disk was the eye of the formation, and the formation flags existed to transport spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did all life in the world use spiritual energy, all spells and cultivation methods required the support of spiritual energy too. Formations operate in the same logic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had been educated since young and had learned about formations. Although she was not a genius in the area, she still understood the basics. She had followed her subordinate to study formations for a period of time. One method was to use brute force to directly crush the formation. However, Bai Qingqing’s current cultivation was lacking. The other method was to find the formation eye, which was her only option right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stabilized her mind and felt the spiritual energy in the air. When her heart calmed, she saw the movement of the spiritual energy. At first, the movement seemed elusive, but with time, Bai Qingqing slowly found the direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She found that the spiritual energy was slowly flowing to the northeast. With excitement, she confirmed her doubt. She saw the spirit force move like ripples on water toward the green bamboo in the northeast. Bai Qingqing suddenly opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wind Flower Sword in Bai Qingqing’s hand trembled and she released her full aura. Spirit force flowed through her body and she moved as fast as lightning. When Zhao Jiuge reacted to Bai Qingqing’s sudden action, a ray of sword energy had already shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ray of sword energy shined brightly and accurately hit the swaying bamboo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bamboo wasn’t cut in half as expected, but the scenery suddenly changed. The air around the area seemed to distort and the surroundings seemed to have changed. The bamboo forest was still the bamboo forest, but there was more color now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bamboo where the sword energy had landed had long disappeared and was replaced by a palm-sized hexagonal disk with a pattern carved on it. It gave off a faint light, but it fell to the ground. It was likely that the things used to set up the formation were damaged when the formation was broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were seven locations shining in the corners of the bamboo forest. They were not discs, but seven brown and black flags. Each flag was about ⅓ of a meter tall and had two spirit stones next to them to provide spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden change in the scenery shocked Zhao Jiuge. When he saw the disk and flags, his eyes burned with passion. He quickly rushed over and grabbed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because there were a lot of things, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t hold them all with his two hands. He had to wrap some of them around his chest. He had a happy smile while running back to Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing felt infuriated and funny when she saw Zhao Jiuge’s expression. Although she was thinking this, she deliberately put up a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge ran before Bai Qingqing and happily said like a child, “Look, these are the formation disk and flags. This is the first time I've seen something like this. Qingqing you’re really too awesome.” Only at the end did he remember to praise Bai Qingqing. He held out the items before him like he wanted to show them off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing couldn’t do anything before this brat. Whenever she wanted to pretend to be serious before him, he always made her laugh. “Okay, okay, put them away in your storage ring first. You can study it later when you have free time. Now, onto official business.” As she spoke, she looked uphill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge heard this, his gaze followed Bai Qingqing’s and the smile on his face slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were eight men holding various treasures, looking down at them with ferocious expressions. A late stage Spirit Transformation Realm, a mid stage Spirit Transformation Realm, two early stage Spirit Transformation Realm, and four late stage Blood Movement Realm cultivators—a total of eight people. Although they had a lot of people, it was fortunate their cultivation levels were not high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has to be said that the difference between realms was not something that could be made up with numbers. Two Spirit Transformation Realm cultivators did not equal a Foundation Realm cultivator. Looking at the other side, Zhao Jiuge felt the killing intent flow into his heart. He didn’t know why, but he felt a bit of inexplicable anger that he wanted to vent. Perhaps it was because he had learned of their crimes, or because the illusion formation had provoked him. Bai Qingqing had already been completely enraged by Han Songcheng long ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them held their swords that were flashing with spirit light and walked up the slope step by step. Their Foundation Realm cultivation was on full display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they stepped on the dead branches and leaves, the sounds weren’t loud, but they were especially ear-piercing in this atmosphere. One step, two steps—the distances between the two sides constantly got smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the two people walking toward them, Zhang Long’s heart became even more heavy. The auras they gave off were extremely powerful, the likes of which he had only felt from Han Songcheng before. No wonder Han Songcheng seemed to be in such a rush earlier. It seemed like he had encountered some difficult opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the two of them had broken through, Zhang Long’s heart only felt a bit heavy. However, he didn’t panic. After all, he had expected the two of them to break out. At this moment, Zhang Long actually began to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although today’s situation was a little dangerous, he didn’t have much choice. Since he was working under someone else, he had to risk his life for them as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the eight people’s breathing stopped and their hands turned white from clenching their treasures too hard. Although there were only magic treasures, they were also their greatest insurances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the two people arrive at the edge of the flat area, Zhang Long realized that if he let this continue, their side would be completely suppressed. Momentum often played a great role in a battle of life or death. Not to mention the fact that Zhang Long believed that with the eight of them, they wouldn't necessarily lose even if the other side had stronger cultivation. This was because he still had an ace—the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram Han Songcheng had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still didn’t know the mysteriousness of the sword diagram well and couldn’t display much of its power, but ever since the eight of them started practicing it, the power they displayed made him happy and also a little shocked. The wonder of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram was a real eye-opener for him. This was why Zhang Long felt particularly confident in the upcoming fight. At the same time, he felt an impulse—he wanted to see how his group of eight would face off against two Foundation Realm cultivators in a fight. He wanted to see how strong Han Songcheng was and how big the differences between them were!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once killing intent filled the area, neither side wasted time speaking nonsense—they chose to act instantly. The first to attack holds the advantage. There was nothing more valuable than time in a fight between two similarly powerful masters, and victory or defeat was often decided in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long immediately took the lead and shouted, “Attack! Just like we practiced, don’t panic.” He took out a small sword from his waist and held it tightly in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside him, Fat Dragon, Cheng Jianqian, and others all licked their lips, their eyes ferocious. They were, after all, people who lived to fight. Even though their opponents were strong, their bloodlust had erupted. The bit of panic they had felt turned into a ferociousness. Most importantly, their leader, Zhang Long, had already taken the lead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight people held various magic treasures—large blades, long swords, hammers, etc. All of them shined with spirit light, making them very eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had already been patient for a long time. Previously, she was infuriated by Han Songcheng, and it had taken some effort to catch up. Then she was trapped by this illusion for a long time, and now she had encountered these people blocking her path. Bai Qingqing’s face was cold to a terrifying degree and the killing intent surged in her heart. Her black, silk-like hair and green dress fluttered. Unfortunately, the other party didn’t have the heart to appreciate her beauty.</span></p>
