 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

His expression changed and he quickly went up to help them with Liu Yinger. They belonged to the same group, and no matter what kind of friendship they had with Zhao Jiuge before, they were now on different paths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie slowly walked up. They didn’t do anything, they just silently watched this. However, Lou Xie was on guard and his spirit force remained around his body. He was worried that Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger would suddenly make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more than a dozen youths all had the same expression and stared at them. Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie didn’t make a sound. They didn’t blindly attack but were on guard. Although they were only at the Spirit Transformation Realm, with their numbers, they were not afraid of just two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Baiwan’s eyes narrowed and his expression kept changing as if he was thinking about something. Seeing the more than a dozen people move forward, he was about to make a reckless decision, but once he saw Zhao Jiuge and Lou Xie, he hesitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A big battle was raging inside his heart. He was thinking about their friendship from when they first entered the sect. Although they had torn apart all pretense, asking him to actually fight was something else. He would feel a bit embarrassed if he actually made a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the five of them, his family had the deepest foundations and he had a lot of treasures. Otherwise, he would not have been so generous when he first entered the sect. He didn’t care about a dozen or so Spirit Transformation Realm cultivators. Even if there were double this number, he would dare to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side, Liu Yinger seemed to notice the struggle Wang Baiwan was going through. She softly whispered something to him, and he was shocked for a moment before nodding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately stood up. Although he didn’t release the spirit force he had gathered, he put his flying sword away. He showed no sign of wanting to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly walked up a few steps and stared at Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie with a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to fight?” The vigilant Luo Xie also had a complicated expression. He felt very grateful for the spirit stones Wang Baiwan had given him, and he didn't think they would face off like this today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Baiwan no longer had that honest-looking appearance and let out a cold snort. He looked to the side to avoid Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then there was a flash of light before his chest and more than 200 flags appeared on the ground. He quietly said, “We don’t want to fight today, but if a similar situation arises, then I’ll not take into account our previous friendship. From now on, Yinger and I will have nothing to do with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, what do you mean?” Although Zhao Jiuge’s face was deathly pale, he endured the discomfort and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt happy that he wouldn’t have to fight Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger, but seeing Wang Baiwan throw the flags down made him feel uncomfortable. Was this sympathy or a reward? If he wanted the flags, he would fight for them himself, he didn’t want to obtain them like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Do you still want to do something? Do you think that Big Brother Baiwan and I are afraid of you all? We are just taking into account our previous friendship and the fact that we shouldn’t fight among ourselves since we are all from the Mysterious Heaven Peak. However, in a private dispute, we will not hold back like today.” Liu Yinger’s expression was no longer tender and her voice was frosty. At the same time, she glanced at Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was also a proud person. He didn’t want to become enemies with Liu Yinger and Wang Baiwan, but since they had already said this, he was not going to waste his time. He calmly watched for what they were going to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Liu Yinger finished speaking, she looked profoundly at Zhao Jiuge and then simply left with Wang Baiwan. They helped carry away the gloomy and silent Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo off the top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge met Liu Yinger last time, he already knew in his heart that the two of them were destined for different paths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I didn’t expect you to be so charming. Looking at her resentful gaze, no wonder you say people call you a block of wood.” Bai Qingqing walked up next to Zhao Jiuge with a playful smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge originally felt tension in his heart, but after hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, it was all gone. He didn’t know how to respond to her. No matter how much of a blockhead he was, he could see Liu Yinger’s intent. However, he already had someone in his heart, not to mention there was more than one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He let out a sigh in his heart and pondered a bit about his own affairs. Then his expression suddenly changed into a wicked smile and he said, “Since I’m so charming, has our Big Sister Qingqing been smited by me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing took a deep breath and suppressed her chest from heaving up and down before revealing a charming smile. Zhao Jiuge already knew that the situation was not good, but due to his injuries, he couldn’t make any big movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, his ear was gripped by Bai Qingqing’s hand. “Did your skin become itchy because you saw that this old lady was worn out? I’ll tell you this: even without any spirit force, this old lady can still deal with you.” Bai Qingqing’s vicious words echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie and the other youths nearby all smiled at this. After all, there were no outsiders left here on the top, so they could relax. They were the biggest winners of this training. Even if there were disciples of the other peaks remaining, it was no longer important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly begged for mercy. “I was wrong, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort and proudly raised her neck like a white swan. She wasn’t going to waste time with him. If it wasn’t for the fact that her spirit force was all used up from using The Green Tide Rises, she would have already taught him a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked at the flags on the ground and softly said, “Well, you got first place in this training exercise and what this old lady promised you is fulfilled. Collect these flags.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Zhao Jiuge excitedly picked up the pile of flags and put them inside his storage ring. He had more than 400 flags now, and the remaining few dozen people still wandering around the peak no longer mattered, because the overall situation had been decided. Zhao Jiuge even felt the pain in his body reduce. He had a silly smile on his face when he thought about the precious treasure-grade flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group next to them had faint smiles on their faces. There was no jealousy or dissatisfaction because Zhao Jiuge had earned it. As for Bai Qingqing, those swords weren’t worthy of her attention, so she didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were about 500 disciples in total participating in this training, and he had more than 400 flags. He was, without a doubt, the top-ranked disciple in this training exercise. After Wang Baiwan’s group left, there were no longer any Foundation Realm disciples threatening them. The training had come to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a day of fighting, the light from the sunset scattered across the top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about everything that had happened, Zhao Jiuge felt a lingering sense of fear. It had taken too much luck to obtain victory. If it wasn’t for all that luck, he would be lying on the ground and would have to recover for a few months. Time was far too valuable for him right now. He still had to complete the task and refine the armor—he had to do this before the inner sect selection. Today’s training was like a warm-up to the selection.</span></p>
