 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Zhao Jiuge’s heart trembled, and he subconsciously released his spirit force to protect his body. He was about to use the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Three-tailed Yin Cat had only raised its paw to groom its hair. Zhao Jiuge felt anger from being played with. Then he coldly said, “So it was you who took the lives of all these ordinary people?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Zhao Jiuge’a angry question, the Three-tailed Yin Cat lazily raised its head. It was as if it was saying, “So what if it was me? What can you do about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge carefully stared at the Three-tailed Yin Cat and recalled the explanation about absorbing essence blood. The description said that some demonic cultivators relied on absorbing other people’s essence blood. The stronger the target, the more their cultivation level would rise. He had seen many evil cultivation methods recorded in the jade, but he never expected to encounter one here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression sank. This Three-tailed Yin Cat was the real culprit behind this. Those that died tragically were killed by this cat to increase its cultivation level. He and the old Daoist were cultivators, so sucking their essence blood would increase the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s cultivation level greatly. If he were to die today, the people of the village would not be spared. Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge’s heart became chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked at the spirit force released by the Three-tailed Yin Cat, he felt danger. He had only had this feeling twice before. The first time was when he fought the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, the second time was when Daoist Yi Qing had caught him. This feeling made Zhao Jiuge very uncomfortable and at the same time powerless. He didn’t dare to act recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gust of night wind blew by Zhao Jiuge’s face. The night wind was cold, and Zhao Jiuge suddenly sobered up. He put up gourd and felt like something was wrong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Three-tailed Yin Cat appeared with a look of disdain, with cultivation no weaker than mine. I also just fought the Green Haired Zombie, so I’m only at 40% of my spirit force. So why has the Three-tailed Yin Cat been in a deadlock with me for so long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was on high alert as he stared at the Three-tailed Yin Cat. The Three-tailed Yin Cat’s dark green eyes were also locked on Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s strange dark green eyes, Zhao Jiuge felt a bit dizzy. He became drowsy and had the impulse to close his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of the Sanskrit Sutra suddenly echoed in Zhao Jiuge’s ears, causing his heart to tighten. He found that the buddha in his dantian had opened its eyes and was gently whispering the Sanskrit Sutra. The sound had completely awakened Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After becoming sober, Zhao Jiuge immediately looked at the Three-tailed Yin Cat and found disappointment in its eyes. Zhao Jiuge was shocked and found this to be strange. He thought that if hadn't been awakened by the Buddha in his dantian, he would have lost all his fighting power and would’ve been easily finished by the Three-tailed Yin Cat. He felt lingering fear and appreciated his cultivation method even more. He decided that once he had some success in his cultivation, he would go to the Carefree Valley that his teacher, Ye Wuyou, had mentioned. He had to know his teacher’s origins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Cat became either impatient because its plan had failed or angry from the embarrassment. It could not hold back anymore and its eyes became gloomy. All the hair on its body stood up and it let out endless harsh cries. Some dark green halos spread out with the cries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The endless cries continued without pause. Zhao Jiuge felt his head swell like it was going to break. His heartbeat accelerated like it was going to explode. However, soon, a cool feeling filled his body and a layer of golden light covered his body. The headache and other issues disappeared. When threatened, the Sanskrit Divine Body would appear on its own. The Three-tailed Yin Cat was too strange. Zhao Jiuge could not afford to be stingy with his remaining spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul Piercing Sound! He didn’t expect the Three-tailed Yin Cat to have this ability. It was using sound to pierce the soul! Although this would consume his spirit force rapidly, he could not worry about that while facing the Three-tailed Yin Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who attacked first would have the advantage, and the one who acted second would suffer. Not to mention Zhao Jiuge was already in a disadvantageous position with the majority of his spirit force exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Sanskrit Divine Body protected Zhao Jiuge, he exuded golden light from his entire body. He took two steps forward and threw the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd into the air. The Purple Golden True Fire Gourd just floated in the air. With a thought, Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force surged out into the gourd. The gourd aimed at the Three-tailed Yi Cat. Orange fire surged out, covering the sky and giving this cold village a bit of warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge coldly looked at the Three-tailed Yin Cat and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph, yin objects are especially afraid of thunder and fire attribute spells and treasures. Don’t you love to cry? Let me burn you to death, then we’ll see if you still dare to cry like a wild cat in spring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monstrous true fire immediately turned into a fire dragon and flew toward the Three-tailed Yin Cat. The Three-tailed Yin Cat looked at the fire with eyes filled with disbelief. It didn’t know why its abilities had failed repeatedly. It had always been very successful with them before. The monstrous fire lit up the cat’s face, and it could even feel a burning sensation. Although it didn’t know how the person before it had resisted its Soul Piercing Sound, the cat revealed a look of disdain toward Zhao Jiuge. It raised its left paw and swiped toward the fire dragon. Dark green spirit force surged out and collided with the orange fire. There were also gusts of chilly wind that accompanied the dark green spirit force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the true fire collided with the green spirit force. The result shocked Zhao Jiuge. The true fire didn’t burn the cat to ashes like the Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On first contact, the two canceled each other out and mixed together. Then the orange fire began to slowly extinguish and become smaller and smaller. Although the green spirit force was dimming, it was obvious that the fire was extinguishing faster. The orange fire split into small flames, then the remaining green spirit force formed a giant, green palm and crushed the remaining true fire. The courtyard became gloomy once more and the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd lost all its light before falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge reached out to catch it and put it back in his storage ring. He didn’t stop moving. Although he didn’t understand why the true fire had no effect on this cat, it was too late to stop now. The longer this went on for, the worse the situation would become for him. He needed to buy time for the old Daoist to recover spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grabbed the Blue Plum Sword from his back, and there was a flash of blue. Zhao Jiuge took a few steps and bent his left leg slightly. Then he leaped into the air and drew a half moon arc with his sword. A ray of sword energy flew toward the already weakened green palm, instantly cutting it in half. Without looking at the result, Zhao Jiuge landed on one knee and then rolled toward the Three-Tail Three-tailed Yin Cat. His left foot gently tapped the ground and he immediately got up with the Blue Plum Sword raised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword was slanted toward the cat, and it shined brightly, revealing its sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-Tail Three-tailed Yin Cat was unmoving while it watched the palm being destroyed. It coldly watched Zhao Jiuge perform this series of actions and hadn’t done anything until Zhao Jiuge closed in. Then the cat rushed forward and kicked off with its hind leg. When the Three-tailed Yin Cat felt the sharp sword aura, it revealed a look of mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge wanted to injure the cat in close combat with the sharpness of his weapon, but the Three-tailed Yin Cat had long seen through Zhao Jiuge’s plan. However, this was its plan as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharpness of the sword erupted after Zhao Jiuge waved it. One could even feel the wind being sliced around the sword. Zhao Jiuge kicked off the ground and leaped into the air to the same height as the Three-tailed Yin Cat. His spirit force surged, his hand rose, and the sword slashed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge could see his own figure in the green pupils of the Three-tailed Yin Cat. The human and the cat were very close at this moment.</span></p>
