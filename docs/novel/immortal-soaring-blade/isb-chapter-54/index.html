 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the slightly depressed Zhao Jiuge almost wanted to laugh when he saw Wang Baiwan’s funny movements. This helped ease his tension a lot, but there were still many people filled with shock. They even backed away from the cliff and wanted to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, after another person fell and let out a miserable scream, it mentally broke some of the youths. One person panicked and ran down the mountain, and with one person taking the lead, dozens followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Liu Yinger got close, her fragrance had already rushed over. She walked over and shouted gently, “Zhao Jiuge, Luo Xie, let us go.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge nodded in agreement and was going to walk up with Liu Yinger, but Luo Xie wasn’t with them. His lecherous expression was long gone and his face was deathly pale. He was quibbling and refused to take a step until Zhao Jiuge and Liu Yinger looked back with doubtful gazes. Luo Xie finally followed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Luo Xie like this, Zhao Jiuge had guessed the situation. He hadn’t expected the lecherous Luo Xie to be so timid. He originally thought Wang Baiwan would be the most timid, but now the two had switched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The miserable cries of people falling off the cliff vaguely came from the distance, causing Luo Xie’s legs to shake even more, but he still smoothly walked forward. Liu Yinger giggled as she looked at Luo Xie, who looked like he was walking to his death. After Luo Xie had disappeared from view, her smile disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was extremely serious and tense. After all, there was only one life. However, if she didn’t go forward, she would feel regret. A gust of fragrant wind blew by and Liu Yinger stepped forward onto the chain. Only when she disappeared did Zhao Jiuge withdraw his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the people he was familiar with going forward, Zhao Jiuge readied his mind to enter the test. Only half of the people were left. Some people wanted to pursue cultivation, while others escaped. Now the cliff was much more deserted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t laugh or feel disdain toward those who escaped. Everyone had different priorities, and there was no point in worrying about others. He just needed to do what he wanted to do. The cold, mountain wind blew on his body. Even though his body had been strengthened by the Sanskrit Divine Body, he could not help but feel a chill as he looked up at the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sense of gentleness surged in Zhao Jiuge’s heart. Unknowingly, beside Bo Re’s cold and noble figure, the figure of the cute and playful Su Su had appeared. At this moment, he didn’t know what they were doing. Was Su Su’s temper still the same as before? Were they both looking at this vast sky like he was?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the brilliant night sky, he was very small, but this would not stop his pursuit for strength. The gentleness in his eyes was gradually replaced with determination. He took a deep breath and let out a mouthful of foul air. Without hesitation, he took big steps toward the edge of the cliff. The momentum he carried attracted the attention of some people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zhao Jiuge didn’t care about any of this—he was completely focused on stepping onto the chain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He adjusted his condition to his peak and his eyes closed. When he opened his eyes, his right foot stepped onto the floating chain. Although the chain looked thick, it didn’t feel that way when his foot was on it. It felt like his whole person was hanging, but after putting one foot on it, Zhao Jiuge was a bit more certain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His pursed lips gradually relaxed and his entire tightened face relaxed. Once he stabilized his center of gravity, his left foot stepped onto the chain as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chain made a sound as it swung, and this scared Zhao Jiuge so much that cold sweat came out. He immediately calmed his mind and opened his arms to maintain his balance, then he walked on the chain. Soon, he disappeared into the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he made his way forward, the cold sweat that had appeared on his back gradually dried. He could not see far due to all the white mist, and after walking for a while, he saw no end in sight. He also didn’t see anyone that was before him. This endless loneliness, combined with the cold wind, made Zhao Jiuge feel more and more uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know that the first trial of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was a test of courage. There was no lack of danger on the path of cultivation, and where there was danger, there were opportunities. If a disciple didn’t even have the courage to try, then there was no need to talk about cultivation—it was fine to not even take these disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Hua Academy and the Ten Thousand Dao Sect were accepting almost all disciples. Their numbers could be as high as tens of thousands of people. How could they compare to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, where even if you added all three factions, there were only a few thousand people? In addition, another reason why the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had declined was that the other holy lands cared a lot about talent. The better the talent, the better treatment they would get. Also, when they recruited large numbers of disciples, there would naturally be some hidden gems among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect cared about a step-by-step process. They didn’t look at talent, but trained a disciple's heart and character. Even though the sect had declined and this generation was not as strong as the previous, any disciple of the sect would have a solid foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, as long as they were willing to take the first step, even if they fell off the cliff, it would be considered a pass. There was also no real life-threatening danger as the three instructors and dozens of disciples were all waiting under the cliff. This seemingly simple trial had nearly eliminated ⅓ of the people. This was also merely just the Mysterious Heaven Peak Faction’s trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cold wind surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the wind between the mountains landed on Zhao Jiuge’s body, he felt bone-chilling pain. It was as if he had fallen into an ice coffin and all the pores on his body were closed. He was even afraid to breathe in fear of bringing more coldness into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His clothes fluttered louded in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His legs had long gone stiff and he no longer dared to cycle spirit force. Earlier, he was using spirit force to resist the cold, but as time passed, he noticed that his spirit force was draining faster and faster. He could not see the end ahead, so he decided to not use spirit force and relied on his perseverance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cold wind continued to blow, but it didn’t affect Zhao Jiuge’s determined heart. He clenched his teeth and his face was a bit fierce as he resisted the harsh environment and the chain under his feet. Zhao Jiuge didn’t notice that this walk between life and death had caused his heart to undergo a metamorphosis. It would lay a solid foundation for the long road ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chain formed a semi-circle. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt like the cold wind was not so violent anymore and the cold seemed to gradually dissipate, revealing the surrounding environment around and below him. The moon and stars were shining in the clear sky, revealing the ocean of trees. Their leaves rustled in the wind and looked like ocean waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other two sides were like the endless abyss. Any ordinary person who looked down would be terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The endless sky was filled with bright stars. He had never seen this kind of scene growing up in the village. At this moment, he felt his entire heart open up, and a sense of pride overtook him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His stiff and numb legs became even more powerful. He saw the chain tilt upwards and couldn’t help but cheer up as he should be close to the end. With hope, his entire body became energetic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His breathing was rough, and because of the temperature, it created cold clouds before his face. Due to himself overdrafting his body, even his breathing sounded like a wind box. The mountain range was very humid, causing his handsome face to become a bit cold. Although it was cold, the mountain range was filled with spiritual energy. Even though he wasn’t cultivating, his Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation allowed his body to absorb spiritual energy through his skin subconsciously. It was slower than a snail moving, but Zhao Jiuge unexpectedly found his spirit force to be growing. He thought about how after the trials, he would finally have a place to cultivate in peace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was going to cultivate the second golden dragon for the Sanskrit Divine Body, as well as the legendary sword techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Just thinking about this made Zhao Jiuge’s heart burn with passion. His steps became lighter as he walked faster to get to the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He vaguely heard words from ahead. When he got close, he saw figures ahead of him. Zhao Jiuge saw Wang Baiwan’s fat body, who was bragging about his own heroism. He had returned to his jolly, old self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge saw that there were only a few dozen meters left, he completely relaxed. His legs began to move faster, until the last ten meters, where he began to run. Then he jumped and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the steadiness of the earth, Zhao Jiuge let out the last breath he was holding. The sense of floating disappeared and he gasped for air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hands were on his knees and his back bent as he caught his breath. He looked up at the end of the chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Jiuge, you’re here too.” Wang Baiwan was still happily talking when he saw Zhao Jiuge arrive. His face was filled with excitement and the fat on his body trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the crowd observed Zhao Jiuge. They wanted to know who the new arrival was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was still gasping for air when he let out a sound and nodded.
