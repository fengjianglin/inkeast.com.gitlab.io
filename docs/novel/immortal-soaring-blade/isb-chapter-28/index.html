 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie’s eyes were also shining. When he saw the powerful spell Zhao Jiuge had used, his heart started burning with desire. The heart was an incomprehensible thing, and the hearts of cultivators were more vicious than any ferocious beast. After all, no matter how close two friends were or how in love a couple was, no one could withstand the temptation of a powerful treasure or spell. In the pursuit of immorality nothing was more important than strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After weeks of contact, Mo Longjie estimated that Zhao Jiuge didn’t have a teacher behind him and had no relatives left alive. He figured that Zhao Jiuge just had a mysterious encounter to reach his current cultivation level at such a young age. He didn’t know that his mindset was trapped at the small Dong Yang City. He was like a fog trapped inside the well, looking at the outside world—he didn’t know how vast the world truly was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old daoist and Liu Feng were not the only ones tempted—even Mo Longjie’s heart swayed, and he felt greed toward Zhao Jiuge’s spell. He had lived for so long but had never seen such mysterious and powerful spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge still looked calm on the surface, but he really didn’t know what to do. He was on guard and was prepared to run away. After all, the Foundation Realm was far above the Spirit Transformation Realm. The gap in strength between two realms was not as simple as 1+1.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge remain silent, Liu Feng, who was already angry, completely lost his patience. His aura rose and the spirit force around him fluctuated even more violently. His clothes fluttered and he was about to make a move on Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the powerful spirit force rippling and the powerful pressure, Zhao Jiuge was shocked at how powerful a Foundation Realm cultivator was. The first three realms of the Spirit Detecting Realm, the Blood Movement Realm, and the Spirit Transformation Realm were all forging the body and transforming the spirit, so the gap was not that large. However, reaching the Foundation Realm was a big qualitative leap. The pressure from the sky caused Zhao Jiuge’s heart to sink, but he was never one to give up. He activated his Sanskrit Divine Body to defend the attack and then find a chance of escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another violent spirit fluctuation that was no weaker than Liu Feng’s echoed in the air. Seeing that Liu Feng was about to attack Zhao Jiuge, Mo Longjue struggled in his heart before he clenched his teeth. He no longer hid his aura and, to everyone’s amazement, he leaped forward. He floated in the air before Zhao Jiuge and faced Liu Feng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, rationality won against greed and he had decided to help Zhao Jiuge. After all, they had gotten along well and he knew Zhao Jiuge’s character. Zhao Jiuge was someone who would repay kindness and had a boundless future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another uproar echoed across the crowd. Today was simply too exciting, with one change after another. The people here could not handle the stimulation anymore. They hadn’t expected Mo Longjie to have actually broken through to the Foundation Realm! After obtaining the Blue Spirit Pills, Mo Longjie had gone into closed door cultivation for a month and used the Blue Spirit Pills in an attempt to reach the Foundation Realm. After years of accumulation, he was able to successfully break through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the burly man’s eyes were filled with shock and envy. He regretted not being able to steal the Blue Spirit Pill; otherwise, he would’ve had the hope to break through as well. There was also a trace of fear in his eyes, and he decided to find a place to hide to peacefully cultivate. He was afraid the elegant middle-aged scholar would come to get revenge after leaving closed-door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old daoist watched the situation here and a smile appeared on his face once more as he gave up on his greed completely. Neither the Mo family nor the Flowing Cloud Sect were people he could afford to mess with. He regained his peace of mind and focused on watching the show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xiao family panicked. For many years, they had been suppressed by the Mo family. They hoped that with the help of the Flowing Cloud Sect, they would suppress the Mo family, but they never expected Mo Longjie to actually reach the Foundation Realm. Now even Xiao Yi was in disarray, helplessly looking at Liu Feng. Right now, all he could do was completely rely on the Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zheng Jie secretly felt happy among the crowd, hoping that Zhao Jiuge would suffer. Liu Feng’s eyes flickered. He also hadn’t expected the situation to go this far out of his hands. After all, he didn’t represent the Flowing Cloud Sect, and if he caused any problems, he couldn’t afford to take responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ray of light flew onto Zhao Jiuge’s body and then he heard Mo Longjie’s voice. “Jiuge, Uncle Mo knows that the tiny Dong Yang City can’t keep you. I’ll try to keep them here so you can find a chance to escape. This is 2,000 spirit stones, take them. When you get a chance, come back to visit your Uncle Mo. No matter what, the Mo mansion is your home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no emotion in those words, but Zhao Jiuge’s heart felt warm. Zhao Jiuge was not stupid—he knew that Mong Longjie had some sort of plan to keep him here, but in the end, Mo Longjie was still very good to Zhao Jiuge. And Zhao Jiuge felt the warmth of a home here. He also knew how much pressure Mo Longjie was taking in making this decision to face the Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lips tightened and buried Mo Longjie’s kindness in his heart. He secretly promised that once he became strong, he would certainly come back. His eyes became a little wet—only when he was about to leave did he realize how reluctant he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another person who was also reluctant was the little girl, Mo Linger. Her eyes became hazy and her right hand tightly grasped Zhao Jiuge’s sleeve while crying. Although reluctant, she was not unreasonable. The situation was very bad for Zhao Jiuge, and she could not make him stay simply due to her own reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Mo Longjie’s words and seeing that Zhao Jiuge was about to run, the anger from the humiliation toward the Flowing Cloud Sect made Liu Feng decide to capture the boy no matter what. Even if something went wrong, as long as the boy handed over the spell, then his teacher shouldn’t be too harsh on him. Thus, he began to move without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Xiao, I’ll deal with Mo Longjie. You send people to stop that boy.” After saying that, spirit light shined and a terrifying spirit force surrounded the air. This was the power of the Foundation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Liu Feng’s words, Xiao Yi secretly felt relieved, then he shouted, “Xiao Zhan, take some people to capture that boy and set up the Seven-Star Blood Fiend Formation.” His words were filled with hatred. If not for Zhao Jiuge, the situation would not be like this, so he blamed everything on Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the family head’s order, the footsteps of the Xiao family could be heard. A group of men wearing blood-colored armor rushed toward the Mo family like a river of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie jumped into the air, maintaining his majestic aura. “Jiuge, go. Old Mo, you go stop Xiao Zhan. Zheng Jie, you lead the Mo family to stop them.” After giving his commands, he didn’t even look at Zhao Jiuge as he leaped forward toward Liu Feng. At the same time, his spirit force surged and he revealed a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, Liu Feng and Mo Longjie were facing each other in the air, while on the ground, the blood-colored river collided with the black armor of the Mo family. The surrounding crowd constantly retreated in fear of getting caught in the crossfire, but their eyes were filled with excitement. The long-awaited bloodbath had finally arrived!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire air was filled with battle intent and the pressure of spirit force. Zhao Jiuge would not forget the kindness shown to him here. He tightened his lips and touched Mo Linger’s head without a word. His eyes were filled with determination as he surged the little spirit energy he had left and quickly dashed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing left was Mo Linger’s tearful and worried gaze as Zhao Jiuge disappeared. Liu Feng and Mo Longjie held each other back in the sky and Old Mo was battling Xiao Zhang. Zheng Jie was leading the Mo family against the Xiao family, but at this moment, there was a flash of an unknown emotion in his eyes. However, he soon hid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, Liu Feng feared the Mo family’s ace, so he didn’t take the lead to attack but quietly watched the situation. Mo Longjie was just hoping to stall for more time, so he also watched quietly. The two sides simply remained like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Zhan saw Old Mo, his eyes turned blood-red. The long-time enemies had finally met. He didn’t reserve any spirit force against Old Mo, and the violent fluctuations of spirit force from their battle attracted everyone's attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as Zheng Jie led the Mo family against the Xiao family, they charged directly at Xiao Zhan, leaving a gap. Due to his jealousy, his heart had become vicious, so he deliberately left a gap, wanting to borrow the Xiao family to deal with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through this gap, seven figures rushed out from the crowd toward Zhao Jiuge. The seven men were all wearing blood-colored armor and their footsteps were exactly the same, as if they were one person. Even their breathing was on the same frequency, as if they were one.</span></p>
