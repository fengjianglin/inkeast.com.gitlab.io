 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo’s face was bright with energy as he waved his hands. “Some of you may not know me, but most of you are no stranger to me.” Old Mo always had that kind smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, Old Mo, stop talking nonsense and get straight to the point. It’s not the first time we’ve dealt with you.” The person who shouted was the burly and rough-looking man Zhao Jiuge had seen earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, Old Cu, after all these years, you’re still so impatient. Okay, I won’t waste time, but I’ll tell you all the good news. Today, we added a last minute big item that I’m sure will satisfy anyone.” Old Mo was not angry that the burly man had interrupted him. “Then we’ll get straight to the auction. The first item is the Spirit Light Mirror. The starting price is 200 spirit stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivators normally traded with items or paid with spirit stones. A small auction house like this had nothing good, so mainly Foundation Realm and below cultivators would come here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo’s voice continued, “Spirit Light Mirror, rank precious treasure. It can protect against particle spirit force damage. Although it is not strong, it is very practical.” Old Mo held up a mirror that was ⅔ of a meter tall. There were small patterns carved on the edges of the mirror and it released flashes of spiritual energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the mirror in Old Mo’s hand, the audience exploded in debate. “If the first item today is a precious treasure, then what will be the key item?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A defensive treasure. Although not very powerful, it’s very practical.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This treasure is good, but it is not something us Spirit Detecting Realm cultivators can afford.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were many sounds echoing inside the auction house as people talked to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“220 stones.” A crisp voice echoed. It came from the young man who was staring at Mo Linger earlier. The young man shouted the price without blinking and was filled with pride. When Mo Linger saw Zhao Jiuge’s curious gaze, she said, “That young man’s name is Xiong Yikang, the only son of the Xiong family. His father is at the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, and he spoils his son silly. A typical playboy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge gently nodded and his mouth curved up. “Oh, so that’s the case. No wonder our Linger doesn’t even share him a glance.” His tone was very teasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, that’s not the case.” Mo Linger’s face turned slightly red as she muttered and pouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“250.” A cold voice came from a young man among the crowd. From the look of the guards around him, he was from one of the small families in Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You look like someone that could only offer 250. Hmph, 300.” Xiong Yikang spoke very sarcastically and had a look of disdain. It seemed like he had some beef with the cold-voiced young man and didn’t even pretend to be respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing those sharp words, the cold young man’s expression didn’t change at all. “You are merely trash. Every day, you either use your family’s power to bully others or play with women. What else can you do? 400 spirit stones. If you can pay one stone more, it is yours. I won’t argue with you.” The voice was very light, but he didn’t even have to say a single dirty word to curse someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…!” Xiong Yikang clenched his teeth. His face was blue and his eyes were filled with anger. Although he was angry from embarrassment, he really didn’t have any more spirit stones. His family could only get about 1,000 spirit stones a year. While his father doted on him, that didn’t mean he could spend as he wished. He could only let out a cold snort and turn his head. While he didn’t speak, his chest was puffing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few seconds, Old Mo’s eyes scanned the crowd. “400 going once, going twice, last chance for the Spirit Light Mirror. Is there no one? Sold for 400 spirit stones to our Young Master Lin here.” Seeing that no one was willing to increase the big, Old Mo settled the deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">400 spirit stones was not a small amount for these rogue cultivators. Aside from a few individuals, everyone else looked at the cold youth with envy. When the cold youth looked at the reactions of everyone nearby, he felt very proud. Even a faint smile appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiong Yikang saw this, his eyes became even more grim. He kept letting out cold snorts as his expression became uglier and his chest puffed even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the young man successfully purchase the Spirit Light Mirror, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but feel a bit of envy. After all, he had not been exposed to many magical treasures. The only one he had was this longsword he had taken from Xiao Yu. As for precious treasure, he had never even touched one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiuge, ah, the first few treasures are just average. There are three more powerful ones later on. If you like any of them, tell Uncle Mo and I’ll get it for you.” Seeing the envy in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes, Mo Lingjie smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The second item is a medical herb, a 300-year-old Scarlet Yellow Ginseng. It contains powerful spiritual energy and can cleanse the body. It is something Spirit Detecting Realm cultivators must have.” Old Mo smiled as he held up the item. It was a palm-sized ginseng that looked like a person—even the strands looked like the beard of a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“200 spirit stones. Hehe, none of you fight with me. It is for my apprentice, I hope you will give me some face.” At the same time, a surge of spirit force spread across the auction house. The expressions of many ordinary people changed, and even those with low cultivation levels were affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo frowned and pursed his lips, but he was helpless. He rolled his eyes at the old daoist and shouted, “Sloppy Old Daoist, you are using force to settle this matter.” Sloppy Old Daoist didn’t say anything, he just revealed an expression of “what are you going to do about it?” In the end, no one said anything and the daoist got the Scarlet Yellow Ginseng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Items were sold off one by one. Most of them were materials and herbs, but nothing that attracted Zhao Jiuge’s attention. As the auction entered the second half, something that shocked the entire place appeared! The Spirit Gathering Method, a cultivation method. Although it wasn’t good, everyone flocked for it. Although one’s cultivation method determined how far they would go, for ordinary people who had no access to these things, even the most trash cultivation methods were treasures to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Spirit Gathering Method appeared, the whole scene went wild and everyone’s eyes became red while shouting prices. Finally, it was sold for a total of 1,200 spirit stones. Any cultivation method would sell for a lot more than magical treasures. Zhao Jiuge licked his lips and wondered what rank the Sanskrit Heart Sutra was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time slowly passed and the majority of the items were sold. “Haha, these are the last three items for today. The last item was added last minute, so I hope you all have prepared your spirit stones.” Old Mo smiled and then took out a rope-like thing. It was completely black. “This item is called the Black Dragon Whip. It was refined from the tendon of a black dragon. It is a supportive treasure used to trap enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at the Black Dragon Whip but had no interest in it and became a little anxious. Uncle Mo had said that he could have whatever he liked, but these were the last three key items and he still hadn't seen anything he liked. He became anxious but also excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the Black Dragon Whip was purchased by the gloomy old man for 600 spirit stones. When Zhao Jiuge first looked at the old man, he felt uncomfortable, and when he heard the old man’s voice, he got goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then Old Mo took out another item. When Zhao Jiuge saw the item, his eyes widened and he excitedly stood up. His mouth opened up and his lips trembled, but he was too excited to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a flag about one meter tall, and it was made of some unknown material with a pattern on it. The pole was small enough to hold with one hand. Zhao Jiuge fell in love with it at a glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Li Fire Flag. After injecting spirit force into it, it will spew out Li Fire. It also has its own personal space inside it, although not large, it’s close to being a spirit treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Mo, I really like this magical treasure.” Zhao Jiuge swallowed his mouth and was filled with anticipation. “Haha, Uncle Mo here is a man of his word, as long as you like it.” Mo Longjie smiled and whispered to Zheng Jie, who was behind him, “Go down and talk to Old Mo,” Zheng Jie respectfully said “Yes, Family Head.” When he turned around, his eyes were filled with envy, but that was hidden in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zheng Jie walked down to Old Mo and whispered something. Then Old Mo said, “Sorry, everyone, the Li Fire Flag has already been bought by someone.” The voices from the auction house became soft. A voice loud like bells ringing echoed as the burly man shouted, “It’s rare to see something that interests me, Old Mo. Why can’t I bid on it? Why was it directly bought by someone?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo was a bit embarrassed. “This is indeed our bad. Our family head is taking this to give to someone. Today’s last item is very important and will surely satisfy everyone. If it doesn’t satisfy everyone, then I will feel sorry for our Mo family’s fame,” Old Mo explained with an apologetic smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, then I’ll wait and see what the last item is. Making it so mysterious...” Old Cu let out a cold snort and sat down still a bit angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo resumed his kind smile and said in a mysterious tone, “Okay, everyone, let us all see the last item today.
