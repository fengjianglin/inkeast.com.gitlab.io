 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Zimo also stepped forward, and his voice was heavy. “Then you only have three Foundation Realm cultivators, so what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, the momentum changed once more. If his aura was like a polished sword before, then now he was like an unsheathed sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the three of them, the person that hated Zhao Jiuge most was Bai Zimo. However, after over a year of growth, Bai Zimo was better at hiding this resentment instead of showing it on the surface. After all, showing it on the surface wouldn’t help in achieving his ultimate goal. Zhao Jiuge was already on a blacklist in his heart, it was just a matter of time before he dealt with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m telling you to stop wasting your time. Dream on if you want us to follow you and be your cannon fodder. We may only have three Foundation Realm cultivators, but if you want to see how strong we are, just try to stop us. If you try again, don’t blame me for breaking all pretense. At most, I won’t participate in the training, but I’ll still fight to make sure you all don’t participate either. I’m sure none of you will have it good either.” Zhao Jiuge had lost his patience with them and no longer wanted to waste time talking nonsense with them. His angry roar echoed across the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if to support Zhao Jiuge’s words, Leng Rufeng and Luo Xie stood behind him, facing off against Bai Zimo, Mu Zijun, and the youth with the scar. The youths behind them followed, their spirit force surging to show off their might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere suddenly changed, and the female disciples and the other spectators quickly fled. They feared that if the two sides fought, they would be dragged in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene was unexpected for Mu Zijun. He quickly calculated the situation and considered the consequences of a fight now. He was also afraid of breaking all pretense and suffering heavy losses that would affect them in the training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhao Jiuge, don't be too proud now. The future is long.” Mu Zijun left those vicious words before turning around to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his right arm and waved. He then shouted, “Let’s go, we’ll go discuss the training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Mu Zijun’s actions, the youth with the scar and Bai Zimo gave one more gloomy stare at Zhao Jiuge before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the 30 to 40 disciples from influential families followed them to discuss how to steal the flags during the training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, a good portion of the remaining people left the lively square. The spectators who weren’t involved saw that there was nothing interesting left to watch, so they whispered to each other before looking at Zhao Jiuge’s direction and left as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the 20 to 30 people in Zhao Jiuge’s group remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiuge, what should we do in half a month? Together or apart?” While Leng Rufeng asked, he looked profoundly at Bai Qingqing. Her actions today had completely subverted his impression of her, and he had a good impression of her now. Not only him, but all the disciples from poor families all had the same thought. Her actions today had earned their respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, go back and cultivate well. When the training begins, I’ll naturally have my own plans.” Zhao Jiuge looked at the familiar faces looking at him with excitement and hope. He felt the pressure on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to disappoint these youths that were similar to him. Zhao Jiuge smiled. “When the time comes, you all just need to follow me. Follow Big Brother and you will eat well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words caused these youth’s eyes to burn with passion. They now had big smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, all of you go back to cultivate. Work hard and improve your cultivation for the training. See you all in half a month. Luo Xie, you need to hurry up and break into the Foundation Realm.” Zhao Jiuge’s expression became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie felt the same and nodded. He led the group away with Leng Rufeng. Even after they walked past Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, they kept looking back at them. Their eyes contained a hint of teasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, only Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing remained on the vast square. Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing and felt the comfortable softness in his hand. His hand moved a bit, feeling a bit antsy. However, the next moment, his entire body quivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it comfortable?” Bai Qingqing looked up, her exquisite face looking at Zhao Jiuge, who was less than ⅓ of a meter away. She had a sweet and charming smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, comfortable.” Zhao Jiuge subconsciously responded, but he immediately reacted. His expression changed and he quickly let go of her waist. His left foot took a step and he pulled some distance between him and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wind Flower Sword had unknowingly appeared in Bai Qingqing’s hand. She maintained that charming smile and said, “If it's comfortable, why don’t you touch it a bit more? Why did you let go so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing and swallowed hard. At 17 years old, he already understood the things between a man and a woman, he just hadn't experienced them. His expression was serious and he pondered for a bit. As if he had gathered up his courage, he spoke without caring about anything. “It’s not that I don’t want to touch, but I don’t dare to touch. If you allow it, then I’ll touch and it won’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge finished speaking, he laughed loudly. Now that he was done teasing Bai Qingqing, he turned and ran away without looking back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhao Jiuge! It looks like you’re getting more and more courageous. If I don’t teach you a lesson every few days, your skin seems to get itchy. I give you a bit of sunlight and you shine, I give you a bit of paint and you think you can color the whole house.” Bai Qingqing’s angry roar echoed from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t turn around but ran even faster. After he was a certain distance away from Bai Qingqing, he quickly jumped onto the Blue Plum Sword and flew into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only at this moment did Zhao Jiuge look at the angry Bai Qingqing and reveal a proud smile. “Cultivate well, we’ll meet during the training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Bai Qingqing saw Zhao Jiuge reveal such a smile after running away in such a pathetic state, she was too lazy to even give chase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Zhao Jiuge disappeared completely, Bai Qingqing, who originally looked like she was filled with rage, suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her laughter was like the brilliant summer flowers blooming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was filled with thoughts and memories. Even she didn’t notice the smile on her own face. Her smile was warm like the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, there was no one here, so no one could appreciate this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gentle breeze caused the corner of her dress to flutter gently, but she didn’t leave. She was immersed in her own memories and didn’t leave for a long time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was thinking about many things while he flew back to his residence. He originally thought Luo Xie would still be discussing the training, but instead he was cultivating on his wooden bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge thought about how Luo Xie used to fall asleep right after he began to cultivate. That was such a big contrast compared to now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time was really a slaughtering knife; not only could it make wood black, make loquat fruits red, turn bananas green—even a person’s nature could be slowly grinded away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the urgency of time, everyone couldn’t help but cultivate harder. As for how to lead them during the training, Zhao Jiuge had no real good ideas. He was just going to take it one step at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current strength, he was very confident. He only regretted that he hadn’t managed to refine the armor before the training. More importantly, he didn’t have a sharp flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, he would be confident in facing those disciples from influential families even if they had higher cultivation levels than him. There were no limits on what people could do, and which of those disciples of influential families didn’t have an ace or two hidden?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge’s greatest ace was the Sanskrit Divine Body. The more he cultivated it, the more he liked it. At certain intervals, the Sanskrit Divine Body would bring about a change. He believed that he would eventually be able to find the true secret of the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about the Sanskrit Divine Body, Zhao Jiuge frowned. He felt that he was about to reach the late stage of the Foundation Realm, but he still hadn't condensed the third golden dragon yet. There were still 13 days before the training. He had to strive to condense the third golden dragon, or else it would be difficult for him to deal with the top disciples of the other two peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge sat on the bed, and with a flash of light, more than 2,000 spirit stones appeared before him. The further he cultivated the Sanskrit Divine Body, the more difficult it would become to condense the next golden dragon, and the conditions would become even harsher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first two golden dragons had only taken time to condense. Last time he tried to condense the third golden dragon, he used a few hundred spirit stones but still wasn’t able to condense it. This time, Zhao Jiuge was determined. He wasn’t willing to believe that he couldn’t condense the third golden dragon if he just threw spirit stones at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the spirit stones around him, Zhao Jiuge closed his eyes and began to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two people quietly cultivated in the room. The fluctuations of spirit force spread and the density of the spiritual energy increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge used his cultivation method to gather spiritual energy like crazy to condense the third golden dragon. He failed time and time again because he couldn’t absorb spiritual energy fast enough, but he didn’t reveal any emotions. When he failed, he just tried again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, because he was attempting it so many times, he had to use spirit stones to speed up the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were cultivating, not far away, in the Mysterious Heaven Temple, several figures were discussing the matters related to the training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Brother Head Teacher, this training exercise has always been done by each peak separately. Why are the disciples of all three peaks competing together this year? Also, the other two peaks have a few youths with pretty good talent. On the other hand, our Mysterious Heaven Peak only has the disciples from influential families that rely on their families but aren’t very strong. When our disciples lose, won’t it be like slapping ourselves?” Jian Wuxuan, wearing a white robe, asked in confusion. His face was more delicate than most women’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Head Teacher Jian Wuxian had his back facing them. His eyes were filled with laughter and the corner of his mouth curved up at his junior brother’s confusion, but he didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Jian Wuxuan even more depressed. He occasionally looked at Jian Wuxian and then back at Jian Wuxie, who was shrouded in a black robe and had no expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxie’s eyes were extremely calm, like nothing could attract his attention. His head was lowered like he was thinking about something, and he was motionless like a statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the three brothers, Jian Wuxuan was the youngest and the most impatient. Seeing his two senior brothers ignoring him, he pouted and no longer spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Jian Wuxian, who was looking into the distance, finally turned around. His purple robe was noble and majestic, but it was being worn by a tender youth who had profound eyes. It was a strange sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know why the master passed the position of Head Teacher to me instead of you two?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxie, who had his head lowered like he wasn’t interested in anything, finally looked up and looked at Jian Wuxian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the pouting Jian Wuxuan became interested, his eyes filled with curiosity.</span></p>
