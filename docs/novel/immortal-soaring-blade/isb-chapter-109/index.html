 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A beautiful young girl seemed to be in a trace while looking into the distance. Her silk-like hair was scattered across her shoulders. The young girl seemed to be waiting for someone as she stared motionlessly into the distance. A while later, the girl lowered her head and sighed in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green Jade Mountain no longer had any trace of green. It was covered in a heavy layer of snow and was wrapped in silver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That girl looking into the distance was Su Su. She had been apart from Zhao Jiuge for almost a year now. Every time she came out of her cultivation, she would come to the mountain where they agreed to meet, hoping for that figure to appear. But it was all just self-deception—she knew that person wouldn’t appear until much later. Su Su had just gotten used to coming here for a walk and zoning out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the heavy snow could not hide the plum blossoms blooming in the mountains. The red dots were very conspicuous in the white snow, and the red flowers were scattered across the snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The plum blossoms made the snow look even whiter, but the snow lost to the light fragrance of the plum blossom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su moved through the plum forest and touched the plum branches that were still covered in snow. This caused the snow to fall on the ground, but Su Su ignored all of this. She was still thinking about the figure she couldn’t forget, to the point of almost going crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su loved the plum blossoms, but what she loved even more was that blockhead. At night, she often asked herself how she felt about that blockhead, only to find that she didn’t even know when that seed had been planted in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They have a five-year appointment, but it had only been a year. Su Su tightly squeezed her half of the jade until her fingers turned white, but she didn’t notice at all. She gently pinched the petal of a plum blossom and carefully looked at it. She smelled the fragrance from the flower and thought about the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could only see the white sky with red plum flowers falling down. It was like a painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her refined eyelashes trembled. When Su Su opened her eyes, she felt like she was in a trance. Then she found that everything was a bit tasteless. She turned toward the picturesque snow scene. The world seemed to become a painting. She quietly stood there as if she had become part of this scene, this painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snow began to fall once more, adding a bit more liveliness to the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a child two heads shorter than her standing beside her. The child was a bit skinny and was afraid of the cold. The child’s hands were clamped together to keep warm and his nose was red from the cold. However, the child was trying not to make any noise, in fear of disturbing the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of snow covered their shoulders. The girl seemed to notice that the child behind her was cold. She withdrew her gaze and looked toward the south only because the blockhead in her heart was cultivating there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su turned around and her gaze became gentle. She softly said, “Little Tian, are you cold? Let us go back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing that they were heading back, although the child was relieved that he wouldn't have to be frozen, his eyes were filled with doubt. He crooked his head slightly and asked, “Big Sister, are we not going to wait for Big Brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Xiaotian had grown a little taller since their meeting at the town of Qing Rong. Although his body was still thin, he had begun cultivating after following Su Su back. However, his progress was slow because his physique was bad due to the lack of nutrition when he was young. There were too many impurities in his body, so his body still feared the cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Zhao Xiaotian’s question, Su Su shook her head and said with a meaningful smile, “He will come when he should come. When he shouldn’t come, no matter how much we wait, he won’t come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Xiaotian blinked. He seemed to understand what his big sister had said, but he also didn’t understand. He was too young to understand the relationship between a man and a woman. “Big Sister, you like Big Brother, so why not go to him? Are you not afraid that Big Brother will run off with someone else in these years?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su raised her right hand and pretended to hit him. Zhao Xiaotian smiled mischievously, knowing that the slap would never land on him—he didn’t even try to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little kid, who told you this stuff? I’ll tell you, if your Big Brother dares to run off with someone else, I’ll chase him down even if I have to go to the end of the world. I’ll kill that cheater and then kill myself. I’ll be his forever.” Su Su's face turned red from what she had said, but in the end, her expression turned inexplicably dark. Zhao Xiaotian was too young to notice the change in her expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su sighed in her heart once more.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I had a choice, I would go with him. However, I have my own unspeakable troubles I must deal with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An air current surged, blowing the snow on the ground into the air like a silver dragon. However, the air flow suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su’s eyes became cold. She didn’t even turn around as she coldly said, “Xue Wuxing, how many times have I told you not to secretly follow me for no reason?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girls words and eyes were so cold, the wind and frost were insignificant in comparison. They were beaten down by the coldness in her bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A feminine young man</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;wearing a blood-colored robe walked out with an ugly expression. He completely ignored the girl’s question and indignantly said, “Is that brat really that good? You have been back for a year and are always in a daze. If you don’t believe me, I’ll go kill him when the time comes. How can I not compare to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words were arrogant and he didn’t back down when facing the girl’s beautiful face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, Xue Wuxing was hiding in the distance and secretly watching the girl of his dreams. However, the last words Su Su had said caused him to become angry, and his killing intent gave away his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su’s beautiful eyes became frosty. She stared at him and shouted, “You dare?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent surged around the young girl. The originally calm snow also began to fly into the air with the surge of killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Su Su, don’t forget your identity. When the time comes, see if I dare.” <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feminine young man</span> was unmoved and coldly left those words before leaving. He disappeared from this mountain that only had white and red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Su Su, who was originally filled with killing intent, suddenly became desolate. Her body softened and even her face became a little pale.</span></p>
