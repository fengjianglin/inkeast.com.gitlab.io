 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Enforcement Hall disciples brought back the disciples from the training exercise, the square gradually became lively again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dozens of figures gathered together and listened to several people in the middle talk. These people were the first to be eliminated during the training. They were not from influential families and weren’t part of Zhao Jiuge’s group. That was why they had been eliminated at the start and sent back here. They were fortunate enough to witness the fierce battle on top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now they were excitedly telling everyone what had happened. The disciples that were eliminated later were all looking at them curiously, which made the few people talking in the middle even more excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three instructors saw this, they didn’t stop them, they just smiled faintly. Their disciples had claimed the final victory, so they felt very proud. Even the harsh Instructor Zhou had a smile on his face. They had guessed the ending but not the process. They hadn’t expected Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing to win like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had shown off the style of the Mysterious Heaven Peak and became famous across the sect. Instructor Zhou was lost in thought; he felt that he was not wrong and Zhao Jiuge hadn’t let him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More and more people gathered, and many disciples were filled with joy. Even though they had been eliminated without reaching the top, their Mysterious Heaven Peak had won! Each of them would be able to receive a magic treasure-grade flying sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dozens of lights that appeared in the sky attracted the gazes of everyone here. At this moment, there were about 60 people here, as some people hadn’t returned and the rest had been sent off for treatment. The Mysterious Heaven Peak only had about 100 new disciples. Almost all of them were here, and these last few dozen of lights were the people who had reached the top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the lights got closer, they could see the figures on the flying swords. It was Zhao Jiuge, Bai Qingqing, Luo Xie, and about a dozen or so other disciples being brought back by the Enforcement Hall disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the last group of people arrived, the group of more than 60 disciples surrounded Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing and cheered. There were no different factions or grudges like the past. They cheered for the honor of the Mysterious Heaven Peak winning the training exercise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their eyes were filled with excitement and passion, which caused Zhao Jiuge to feel a bit embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A small and shy-looking youth who was completely red in the face mustered up his courage and shouted, “Zhao Jiuge, good job!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister Bai, you were very good too. Both of you were extraordinary.” With one person taking the lead, others quickly followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words caused a burst of laughter from the crowd, and Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes. However, everyone was immersed in the excited atmosphere. Not only was the disciple not afraid of Bai Qingqing, he laughed even more. Normally, he would not dare to tease this alluring goddess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, okay, all of you be quiet. Do you all still want the prizes?” Instructor Zhou’s words suddenly echoed across the square. Although Instructor Zhou had a smile on his face, everyone was used to how stern he was, so the square immediately became silent. Then they saw the three instructors looking at them with smiles and the flying swords of different color and sizes next to them. They could no longer stay quiet for long before they burst out in cheers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These cheers only came from a certain group of people. For the small group of disciples from influential families, these magic treasure-grade flying swords were not valuable to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples that were originally grouped together quickly swarm to the front. They all stared at the flying swords on the stone platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although these flying swords weren’t very good in quality, at least they were still magic treasures. For these people without any treasures, it was more than enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Wang faintly smiled and said, “Your performance this time was very good and you didn’t lose face for our Mysterious Heaven Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Li and Instructor Zhou were counting the number of disciples and flying swords. Instructor Li had just obtained these from the Treasure Pavilion. For the sect, this number of magic treasures was nothing. What the sect was more concerned about was the education of these disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Instructor Wang’s words, the noise on the square dimmed until it disappeared completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Instructor Wang finished speaking, he looked at the square. He no longer spoke to tease them and gauged the impatient expressions on some of the disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, looking at all of you, even if I say more, none of you will listen. All of you, come up one by one to receive your magic treasures.” Instructor Wang helplessly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the disciples came up regardless of whether they already had a flying sword or wanted one. These flying swords had all sorts of different shapes and sizes, but they were not allowed to choose. They got whatever was given to them, but even then, most of the disciples were very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after the last person obtained their flying sword, all the flying swords were gone. Only Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing hadn’t received theirs yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stared at the stage in expectation. Instructor Zhou pretended not to see Zhao Jiuge and smiled brightly in his heart. He said to the disciples below the stone platform. “This is your reward. In the future, whether you enter the inner sect or not, you will always be part of the sect. As long as you contribute to the sect, the sect will not mistreat you. In addition, the inner sect selection will be in half a year. Those that haven’t reached the Foundation Realm should quickly reach the Foundation Realm. Tomorrow, Instructor Li and I will take those that reached the Foundation Realm but haven’t tempered their bodies to the spirit veins.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Instructor Zhou finished speaking, the joy from obtaining the flying swords diluted a lot. Those that hadn’t reached the Foundation Realm began to worry. After all, only after entering the inner sect would they truly be like carps that leaped through the dragon’s gate. That was the core of the sect, where they could enjoy endless resources. That was the place they yearned for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s Foundation Realm cultivation, everyone felt envious. They all wished they could be like Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Instructor, what about my reward?” Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but ask out loud. He felt like the instructor had forgotten about this matter. He quickly took out the hundreds of flags in his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhao Jiuge’s question and seeing that anxious gaze, the smile on the three instructors' faces became even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou deliberately put on a stern expression and said, “Don’t worry, you’re not forgotten! We are talking about important matters right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he looked at Instructor Li and nodded. There was a flash of light before Instructor Li’s chest and a silver sword and a green sword appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light emitted by these two flying swords was much brighter than the other flyings words. They gave off sharp auras as they were both precious treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Still not coming up here to get it?” Instructor Li smiled and scolded. He couldn’t hide the smile on his face when he looked at this talented disciple. Not to mention Zhao Jiuge’s strength, even his actions and words were all worthy of praise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly ran up to the stone platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Li stroked his beard and said, “The green one is the Green Jade Sword and the silver is the Big Dipper Sword. Here are your rewards for this training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the two flying swords, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t let them go. They were much more powerful than the Blue Plum Sword. He carefully looked at the flying swords in his hand before he looked up and asked with some doubt, “Shouldn’t there be three? The top three each get a precious treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if Instructor Li knew Zhao Jiuge would ask this, he quickly gave an explanation. “But you and Bai Qingqing are only two people, so there are only two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have more than 400 flags and covered the top three spots. No matter how many people, all three treasures should belong to me.” Zhao Jiuge’s eyes widened. He was angry and anxious. He thought he was going to get three precious treasure-grade flying swords, but now there were only two. For someone who was as much of a miser as him, it was like cutting his own flesh. He didn’t expect such a big sect to care about a precious treasure like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not possible, there are two. If you feel that it's unreasonable, then there aren’t even two, just one.” Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s expression, Instructor Li’s expression became serious. However, he was laughing in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge heard this, he quickly clenched the two flying swords and then put them into his storage ring. He was afraid the two precious treasures would be taken back by the instructors, so he could only helplessly say, “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He left the stone platform with a sense of loss and heartache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the three instructors looked at Zhao Jiuge, they found him to be infuriating and funny at the same time. Instructor Zhou looked at Zhao Jiuge profoundly and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhao Jiuge, ah, Zhao Jiuge, in the future, you will not care about such mere treasures. It won’t be long before you can obtain much more valuable resources with your strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the instructors talked about a few more matters. When the sun was about to disappear, Instructor Zhou allowed everyone to leave. Some disciples ran off to play with their new flying swords. As for those that didn’t care, they were tired from a day of training and went back to their own residences to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the departure of the three instructors, there were only a few figures left. Luo Xie had already left with a group of excited youths and their newly-acquired flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing faced each other. Both of them opened their mouths at the same time. Just as Zhao Jiuge was about to speak, Bai Qingqing interrupted him, “If you want to give me one of the flying swords, then don’t bother. I don’t need it, and they are not good enough to catch my attention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression froze for a moment and he nodded with a complicated gaze. He knew that what Bai Qingqing had just said was true, and he was too lazy to say more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them walked side by side and neither of them said a word. Bai Qingqing was not used to a quiet Zhao Jiuge and felt that this atmosphere was strange. Her brows moved slightly and she asked, “When do you want to complete the mission to hunt the spirit beast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge pondered a bit and then said, “In a few days. I’ll need to recover first and then I’ll come find you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time was of the essence. Although he had entered the Foundation Realm and met the requirements for entering the inner sect, he wanted to continue to increase his strength. Then he would be able to obtain more resources when he caught the attention of some powerful expert and became their disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two most urgent things left to do were to complete the armor and finish the last mission. Once he was done with these two things, there wouldn’t be much time left until the inner sect selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the matter of refining a flying sword, Zhao Jiuge was no longer in any hurry. He currently had two precious treasure-grade flying swords to use. If he was going to refine a sword, he was going to refine a good one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing nodded in agreement. Soon, night fell. Zhao Jiuge was filled with thoughts and didn’t notice Bai Qingqing’s complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked slightly up at the sky and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the last time I can help you. In the future, you will have to walk down this path alone.”</span></p>
