 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them collided and competed in raw power. Bai Qingqing remained unmoved and swung the Wind Flower Sword. She proudly stood there with a happy smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Xuqing let out a snort and was knocked back, using the sledgehammer to stabilize himself. Relying on his late stage Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation, he didn’t suffer any substantial damage. However, the sledgehammer in his hand was dimmer and seemed to have been hit hard. The Wind Flower Sword was, after all, a spirit treasure, while the sledgehammer was a mere magic treasure, so it was reasonable for it to be damaged. Now that Luo Xuqing could not take advantage of his weapon, this made him even more anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Zhao Jiuge directly attacked the man in dark clothes. His violent and cold spirit force surged forward like a crushing wave from the ocean. They were rogue cultivators that lacked cultivation methods, treasures, and cultivation. How could he resist against Zhao Jiuge’s onslaught? His eyes were filled with resentment and hatred when he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge finally realized the joy of battle, but this required him to have strength. Cultivation and treasures were the source of that strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing knocked Luo Xuqing back and her eyes lit up. That feeling of crushing her enemy was fascinating for Bai Qingqing. Luo Xuqing looked at Bai Qingqing’s alluring face and was filled with terror. He knew that the next moment would be the moment of his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His pupils shrank and the beautiful figure continued to expand in his eyes. Bai Qingqing’s eyes became cold and she raised her sword to kill Luo Xuqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong, dong, dong...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a strange drum sound rang out. Vulture had appeared out of nowhere, holding the Twilight Drum and beating it. His old face was filled with self-confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has to be said that the Twilight Drum was very useful, and it was his best ace. It was made from a material from a Twilight Beast and caused people to lose focus. However, the more powerful the cultivator, the less effective it would be, because their mind would be more complete. However, there was no disadvantage when dealing with Foundation Realm cultivators like Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing heard the sound of the drum, she immediately knew Vulture was here. She had suffered at Iron Mouth Village and would not fall for it again. She lost focus only for a moment before she recovered. However, that brief moment was enough for Luo Xuqing to escape death. When he saw Vulture finally appear, he swallowed hard and quickly rushed to him. His hand holding the big, black sledgehammer was trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture squinted and said in anger, “What a vicious little girl.” The atmosphere was a bit different, but his wrinkled face was calm. Looking at the blood-stained ground with broken arms, he found that aside from Luo Xuqing, no one was left alive. Vulture felt shock and anger, but he also wondered how to deal with this situation. It was a matter of life or death, and these two mysterious youths were too powerful. Vulture was already thinking about retreating, but there was still Han Songcheng, who would hold the fort!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture’s methods were vicious, but even he was greatly shocked by this young girl’s actions. His heart felt a bit numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? No matter how vicious I am, I can’t be as vicious as you guys. How many vicious things have you guys done?” Bai Qingqing had a smile on her alluring face, but her words were cold and filled with endless killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s words caused Vulture’s expression to change greatly. He knew that the girl intended to kill him and that he could not get away. His clothes began to flutter without any wind, his aura began to increase, and his spirit force began to fluctuate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think you can resist with your strength? Not even death can wipe away your crimes!” Bai Qingqing’s voice became sharp at the end. Her eyes were ferocious as she moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing saw Vulture try to do something, she revealed a look of disdain. She felt extreme disgust toward him. Bai Qingqing had many aces she hadn’t used yet when facing these rogue cultivators. It was not that she didn't want to use them, there just hadn’t been an opportunity to use them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Bai Qingqing move like thunder, Vulture readied himself. Even though he had been in the Foundation Realm for a few years and was very confident with the Twilight Drum, he still didn’t dare to underestimate Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An aura that was a bit weaker than Bai Qingqing’s erupted. Vulture held the Twilight Drum in one hand and a long, blood-colored sword in another. His eyes bore witness to his cultivation life. Despite his fear, he wasn't a coward when he entered the battle. His years of experience immediately revealed themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stood behind them and carefully observed Bai Qingqing’s movements. His heart was pounding—this was the sword dao he had wanted to pursue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when he thought the two Foundation Realm cultivators were going to begin a fierce battle, something unexpected occurred. The experienced Vulture retreated instead of charging forward, and the fierce Bai Qingqing didn’t take the lead either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This stunned Zhao Jiuge, and Bai Qingqing was also confused. She wondered what this damn Vulture was up to. Vulture didn’t retreat too far; he circled the courtyard, avoiding Bai Qingqing. He only moved to resist the attacks that were a threat to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The &nbsp;walls of the courtyard and the surrounding tree trunks were broken by Bai Qingqing. Every time Vulture escaped, it looked like he had barely managed to do so. Zhao Jiuge benefited from watching him on the side. It turned out that experience was very important when the difference in cultivation levels was small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes suddenly lit up. This old fox was really cunning. He wanted to drag things out to wait for Han Songcheng to appear. Since Han Songcheng wasn’t going to show up, then Zhao Jiuge was going to make it so that he would have no subordinates left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hint of coldness appeared in Zhao Jiuge. He carefully observed the two people moving around the courtyard. When he saw Vulture move to a certain part of the courtyard, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes lit up. His right foot stepped forward and kicked off, a faint light surrounding the Blue Plum Sword. Zhao Jiuge’s expression was serious and he moved like the wind, causing his clothes to flutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After rushing forward more than 20 steps, he arrived right in the path of Vulture’s retreat. Vulture was completely occupied with Bai Qingqing and was dodging her attack. Zhao Jiuge’s Blue Plum Sword slashed through the sky and a ray of sword energy appeared like thunder. When Vulture turned his head and saw this, he was so scared, it was as if he lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Vulture could no longer save his spirit force. His spirit force surged into the blood-colored sword in his hand. Previously, he wanted to drag this fight on so that his spirit force could recover more from the spirit pill and for Han Songcheng to come out. However, now that his life was in danger, what was the use of saving spirit force if he died?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit force that poured into the long, blooded-colored sword shot out toward Zhao Jiuge’s ray of sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t care that Vulture would fight back, he was afraid that Vulture would keep dragging the fight on. He just needed to hold him until Bai Qingqing arrived. Zhao Jiuge didn’t care that he had launched a sneak attack. When dealing with these evil people, it was best to crush them as soon as possible. If the situation were reversed, Vulture would not be so kind. When going out to get experience, the most taboo thing was being soft-hearted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at Vulture the same way he and his grandpa looked at the monkey a performer had brought. The two of them had victory grasped in their hands. In addition, neither of them had used their spells or any of Bai Qingqing’s aces, but they had already slaughtered them until nothing remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After tempering their bodies, their spirit force had gained the cold attribute, and their spirit force surged like waves, crashing into Vulture’s spirit force. The superiority of having an attribute was not something Vulture could compete with. Vulture was instantly forced to stop, and at this moment, Bai Qingqing had arrived behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the cold spirit force and killing intent closing behind him, Vulture didn’t have to look back to know that the girl was closing in. The situation had reached a critical point, so Vulture clenched his teeth and skillfully dodged. The Twilight Drum in his hand shook once more. Even if his spirit force dried up again, he had to risk it to delay for a little more time. He couldn’t figure out why even though they were all at the Foundation Realm, these two’s spirit force was much stronger. The difference between an early stage and late stage Foundation Realm cultivator should not be this big!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Vulture about to shake the Twilight Drum, Bai Qingqing grabbed a jade hairpin from her hair. It was the one she had used against the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf.</span></p>

After this was done, the Twilight Drum in Vulture’s hand rang. Ripples appeared on the water like light curtains, and bubbles constantly formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Bai Qingqing was not affected by the Twilight Drum—she would not fall for the same trick twice! Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort and waved the hairpin again. This time, it wasn’t a water-like light curtain, but a terrifying light that shot toward Vulture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a treasure that could attack and defend at the same time. It was fortunate that Zhao Jiuge didn’t know this was a spirit treasure. Otherwise, Zhao Jiuge would really begin suspecting Bai Qingqing, who was filled with spirit treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The danger that the dazzling light gave off made Vulture’s turn ashen, and he gave up any will to resist. He had never felt anything as terrifying as this. He could only watch it close in, because he knew that anything he did would be futile. Even Zhao Jiuge trembled and could feel the destructive power of that dazzling light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture suddenly realized something and a crazed look appeared in his eyes. His wrinkled face looked up at the sky and he shouted, “Han Songcheng, you will die a dog’s death! You dare to cheat me…” His voice was filled with sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then his voice stopped. Vulture was hit by that terrifying dazzling light. When the light dissipated, Zhao Jiuge sucked in a breath of cold air. This was because the dazzling light didn’t even leave Vulture’s body behind. Aside from the Twilight Drum and the blood-colored sword, not even a speck of dust remained. How could Zhao Jiuge not be shocked?</span></p>
