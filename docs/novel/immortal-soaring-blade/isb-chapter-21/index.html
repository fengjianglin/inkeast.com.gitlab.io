 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The strong are respected, simple as that. Mo Longjie, you better hand over the boy, then we’ll deal with how you stole the Blue Moon Grass separately.” Xiao Yi revealed a smile filled with disdain and his eyes were vicious. “Let’s see how I’m going to deal with this boy today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge was completely calm on the surface, but in his heart, he was panicking a bit. This was the first time he was facing something like this, and only now did he realize how important strength was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie was originally calm, but his face slowly became ugly. If someone were to really harm someone from the Mo family like this, then it would be the same as slapping his face. “Does your Xiao family really think you’re special because someone entered the Flowing Cloud Sect? My Mo family has suppressed your Xiao family for many years, and we can continue to do so!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, this time, the matter will not be solved easily. Either hand over the boy and the Blue Moon Grass, or wait for my Xiao family to start a war,” Xiao Yi said in a cold and gloomy tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie looked at how Xiao Yi had steeled his heart as if he had something to depend on—he couldn’t help but feel a bit afraid. However, seeing how everyone was observing and talking about him, he said, “There's no need to wait to start the battle. Might as well do it now rather than later since everyone is already here.” After he finished speaking, he gathered his spirit force and his aura became stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killing intent erupted in Zheng Jie’s eyes, and he stepped forward like a beast ready to hunt. His whole body was tense as he stared at the other side, ready to fight at a moment's notice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Mo Longjie’s words, the smile on Xiao Yi’s face slowly disappeared and his face became a bit ugly. He didn’t think Mo Lingjie would be so bold and dare to battle without a worry about the consequences of a war before so many people. He originally just wanted to make Mo Longjie look bad and wait until next month, when his eldest son returned from the Flowing Cloud Sect, to destroy the Mo family. He hadn’t expected to jump on a tiger and be unable to get off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi was deliberating this matter in his heart with an ugly expression when he saw Zheng Jie’s arrogant action. He couldn’t help but become angry. “You think only your Mo family knows how to spend resources to cultivate a commander like Zheng Jie? That our Xiao family can’t afford it?” Xiao Yi let out a cold snort and thought of a method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With so many people here, I won’t waste time talking nonsense with you. A month from today, you and I will bring three people to have a contest with a bit of wager. What do you think?” A smile appeared on Xiao Yi’s face as he looked provocatively at Mo Longjie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hesitating a bit, Mo Longjie replied with resolution, “Okay! No matter what the wager is, my Mo family will accept. We’ll meet at the outskirts of Dong Yang City.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi was filled with joy when Mo Longjie agreed so easily, but he didn’t show it on the surface. “5,000 spirit stones, three precious treasures, and the losing family can’t intervene in any business within a few dozen kilometers of Dong Yang City. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xiao Yi’s words, everyone present was shocked. 5,000 spirit stones and three precious treasures were a lot, but with these two families’ foundations, it would just hurt them. However, the last one was much more serious. Right now, in Dong Yang City, no matter what business, the Mo family was a head above the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Xiao Yi had proposed that the loser could no longer intervene in any business in Dong Yang City. This meant that it was a life and death wager. Some people gradually realized that change was coming to Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Mo Longjie heard Xiao Yi’s words, his pupils suddenly shrank. He knew that the other party was scheming against him, but he had to accept it. With this many people watching, if he didn’t dare to accept, then the Mo family would not have any face left in Dong Yang City. “Good, we’ll meet in one month. I want to see what your Xiao family has to be so arrogant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, you’ll know then. A gentleman’s promise, not to mention there are so many people here watching. Brother Mo, we’ll meet in the outskirts of Dong Yang City.” Xiao Yi laughed and waved his hand. Xiao Zhan and the rest of the Xiao family left the alley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yi was the last to leave, but before he left, he turned toward Zhao Jiuge. “Boy, I’ll let you live for one more month.” His eyes were grim and filled with killing intent. Zhao Jiuge didn’t say anything; he had already calmed down. Although Zhao Jiuge was humble and kind, he always had his own pride. He didn’t want to cause trouble, but he was not afraid either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He secretly thought in his heart that a lot of things could change in one month. It was unknown who would kill who yet! At the same time, he made the decision to stay inside the Mo mansion to cultivate for this whole month and use the Blue Spirit Pills to make a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the Xiao family members arrogantly leaving, Mo Longjie had a gloomy expression and left with the people of the Mo family. Now that both sides had left, the tense atmosphere disappeared and the alley returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the surrounding rogue cultivators and small cultivators were filled with excitement. The gamble between the Xiao and Mo families was a once-in-a-century event that would decide the fate of the two big families. They were all looking forward to the result in a month. Soon, the news slowly spread across Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Late night, great hall of the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie, Old Mo, and other members of the Mo family were here. Aside from Old Yao and Zheng Jie, there was also a thin, old man Zhao Jiuge had never seen before here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie’s expression was serious. “Xiao Yi must have come prepared. My guess is that he is relying on the fact that his eldest son, Xiao Yun, is now part of the Flowing Cloud Sect. Even a small sect generally doesn't care about the secular world.” After pausing a bit, Mo Longjie looked at Zhao Jiuge and said, “Even if the Flowing Cloud Sect sends people, they shouldn’t be too strong. Me and Old Mo will handle the first two, I’ll leave the third to you, Jiuge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Mo Longjie’s voice echoed, everyone in the hall looked toward Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge looked at Mo Longjie with his mouth slightly open and was hesitant. He wanted to ask if he could do it. After all, it would affect the Mo family’s future. However, after looking at Mo Longjie’s eyes, he suddenly changed his mind and nodded. “Uncle Mo, rest assured, I’ll do my best.” After that, he revealed a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in the hall didn’t say more because it was Mo Longjie who had spoken, but with Zhao Jiuge’s simple answer, looks of doubt, disdain, and worry were shot toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only person who didn’t look at Zhao Jiuge was Zheng Jie. When he didn't hear his own name from the family head, he was shocked. Before Zhao Jiuge came, every time there was something that needed to be done, he was called upon. Zheng Jie’s expression was a bit unnatural and he looked at Zhao Jiuge with jealousy . His chest heaved up and down slightly as his face turned red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, in two days Old Mo and I will go into closed door cultivation. This month, all of you go out less and don’t look for trouble with the Xiao family.” After calming down the mood, Mo Longjie smiled at Zhao Jiuge “Jiuge, you don’t have to pressure yourself, it all depends on your own effort. Okay, everyone can leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie let out a gentle sigh and took the lead to leave the hall. Zhao Jiuge watched Mo Longjie leave and saw how he was no longer as carefree as he was in the hall—he looked like he had aged many years in an instant. Zhao Jiuge was someone who cared about those that were good to him. He thought about how Uncle Mo had treated him and he secretly decided that he was going to win this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the people all slowly walked out of the hall, and some people were still talking about the matter of the roster. Only Zheng Jie had a gloomy expression as he looked at Zhao Jiuge’s back. He became more and more angry as he secretly made a decision in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Linger caught up to Zhao Jiuge. “Big Brother Jiuge, can you accompany me on a shopping trip tomorrow? I haven’t gone out in a long time. After tomorrow, I’ll have to cultivate properly so I can share my father’s burden.” She was no longer as lively as in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Zhao Jiuge was going to refuse because he wanted to cultivate properly, but then he saw that the girl was not the same. It was as if she had grown up in a day. Her eyes were filled with worry, her gentle brows were slightly furrowed, and her exquisite, snow-white face was filled with unhappiness. Zhao Jiuge reached out and rubbed Mo Linger’s hair. “Okay, I’ll accompany you tomorrow. Come wake me up in the morning, I’m going to go cultivate.” Zhao Jiuge sighed in his heart. He had always treated Mo Linger like a little sister. He could not stay here for long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t seem to expect Zhao Jiuge to agree so easily. Her mouth opened in shock and she seemed a bit lost. Then she regained her senses and revealed a happy smile as she nodded.</span></p>
