 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

The blue robe was covered in blood, but even with so many wounds, Leng Rufeng stubbornly gritted his teeth. He endured the pain in silence, his forehead covered in cold sweat. His face had become distorted from the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at Zhang Pingquan’s happy smile and knew exactly what had happened. Leng Rufeng was already struggling against two, how could he deal with five? It would be strange for him not to be beaten like this. The three strangers were probably Chen Jie, who Zhang Pingquan had spoken of earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“People of the Mysterious Strange Peak, your father will give you a good beating!” Zhao Jiuge let out a hysterical roar. His heart was filled with anger while he rushed toward Ling Longbiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After dealing with three disciples from the Mysterious Strange Peak, there were still nine left. Zhao Jiuge wanted to beat those Mysterious Strange Peak disciples half to death, but he had to deal with Ling Longbiao first!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……….</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost a thousand people saw Leng Rufeng being beaten like this, and all of them were filled with righteous indignation. Those with bad tempers were already cursing and threatening to beat up disciples of the Mysterious Strange Peak no matter what. They clenched their fists and held their breath while they watched things develop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples were all nervously looking at the top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Destiny had allowed them to gather together at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Their sense of honor for the Mysterious Heaven Peak had closely linked them together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lovely Sha Sha had a worried look and asked, “Third Senior Brother, do you think the Mysterious Heaven Peak can keep its place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know. Let’s look, then we will know.” Xu Tianshan shook his head and frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sha Sha became silent, but she shouted in her heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother, do your best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression was cold as he looked at Ling Longbiao. He didn’t waste any time talking nonsense, and the golden light around him shined brightly. The Sanskrit Divine Body was pushed to its peak and he ran toward Ling Longbiao. He had to deal with Ling Longbiao before Cheng Jie’s group of five could react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Zhao Jiuge was filled with anger, even the laughing Buddha around him became more solemn. Whether he was running or walking, this phantom firmly shrouded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Ling Longbiao was able to successfully resist the true fire, his tender, white face had darkened—even part of his hair had curled up. This was a sign that he had been burnt a bit. Ling Longbiao sniffed and smelled some kind of paste. This caused his calm heart to pause once more. It would be a lie to say that he was not angry that he had been attacked by Zhao Jiuge again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge rush toward him once more, he licked his lips and revealed a hint of cruelty in his eyes. He surged his spirit force into the golden flying sword in his hand. He was also at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm, so he didn’t believe he was weaker than Zhao Jiuge, not to mention he had a spirit treasure in his hand! Ling Longbiao was filled with anger, and he wanted to see who was stronger between himself and Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver light around the golden flying sword cycled rapidly, and the sword trembled from the amount of spirit force injected into it. The sword let out a soft hum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the enraged Zhao Jiuge had a ferocious expression and was surrounded in bright, golden light along with the mysterious smiling Buddha phantom. This was not something he could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air became distorted from the aggressive light that was being released from Zhao Jiuge’s body. The small amount of remaining spirit force inside his body was rapidly being consumed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“AHHHHH!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With an angry roar, Zhao Jiuge clenched his fist that was surrounded by golden light and smashed into the spirit treasure-grade flying sword Ling Longbiao was brandishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous rumble echoed across the top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Ling Longbiao’s right hand split open and blood flowed out. The impact had caused his internal aura to become a mess. He felt his chest tightening and tasted something sweet in his throat before blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t fare much better. After all, a spirit treasure was still a spirit treasure. His entire right arm was numb and trembling slightly. His sleeve was completely destroyed. If his right arm hadn’t undergone a transformation due to the Sanskrit Divine Body, this collision with the spirit treasure would have completely wasted his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He originally had about 30% of his spirit force left, but after this collision, he had less than 10% left. He was about to run out of spirit force, but it was enough to deal with Ling Longbiao. Zhao Jiuge's eyes were cold when he thought about Leng Rufeng lying in a pool of blood. Rage surged in Zhao Jiuge’s heart, and he couldn’t care less about holding back at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his right arm was numb, he still had his left arm. His spirit force instantly surged and materialized outside his body. This spirit force was shrouded in a chilly, white fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment this spirit force appeared, it smashed into Ling Longbiao. Ling Longbiao was still flying back from Zhao Jiuge’s attack and hadn’t stabilized himself, so there was no way for him to resist this spirit force attack that contained an attribute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao quickly spewed out a mouthful of blood. His eyes were filled with anger and resentment. However, as soon as the blood spewed out from his mouth, it stopped. A layer of dense, white frost covered his body. After being surrounded by this spirit force, Ling Longbiao was seriously injured. Even the disciples of the Enforcement Hall could not act in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao was covered in a layer of frost and his breathing was extremely weak, but he was still alive. Zhao Jiugeo felt like he still didn’t have enough and wanted to attack once more. At this moment, a young man in black quickly made a move and picked Ling Longbiao up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this young man in black was a disciple from the Enforcement Hall, he was also a disciple from the Mysterious Strange Peak. He released his spirit force to suppress Zhao Jiuge and shouted, “What a vicious youth. The other side has already lost their power to fight, why did you continue to act so viciously!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was already running out of spirit force, and facing this pressure made his body become unstable. The cultivation of these disciples from the Enforcement Hall was not something a new disciple like him could compare with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Zhao Jiuge felt the suffocation in his chest and the pain in his bones, his expression didn’t change. His face tightened and he let out a cold snort. “When facing the fury of a deity, no one is spared. Buddha travels the world spreading compassion, but some people aren’t qualified to receive it.”</span></p>

Zhao Jiuge knew clearly that these were all Buddhist spells and cultivation methods. This made him very happy because it was a clue for him to find the source of his cultivation method. After all, Ye Wuyou had only given him the name of Carefree Valley and no other clues. This cultivation method was very powerful, and its origin was definitely extraordinary. However, among the seven holy lands, only one was Buddhist-based, and he had no real knowledge about the other holy lands.</span></p>

When he arrived, the pressure surrounding Zhao Jiuge disappeared.</span></p>

The instructors only allow us to rescue people, not bully others with your status. Now that you have rescued the disciple, don’t interfere in the training. Quickly, take him for treatment!”</span></p>

Looking at this situation, Zhao Jiuge wondered if this senior brother belonged to the Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the cold young man’s voice, the expression of the young man in black changed. He reluctantly glanced at Zhao Jiuge and then quickly flew away with Ling Longbiao. The cold young man immediately picked up Leng Rufeng and followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this happened in a flash. No one had managed to react to Ling Longbiao’s serious injury. Right now, there were two disciples plus Zhang Pingquan dealing with Bai Qingqing, the two disciples that were fighting against Leng Rufeng, and Chen Jie’s group of three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Peak only had Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, but the Mysterious Strange Peak had eight people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Bai Qingqing still looked very relaxed, Zhao Jiuge was almost out of spirit force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dawn Wind Elder had a mysterious expression. His eyes narrowed and he somewhat admiringly said, “When facing the fury of a deity, no one is spared—very good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words shocked the seven people here, including Jian Wuxian. There was no rule in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect that prohibited disciples from learning Taoist or Buddhist cultivation methods. In fact, they encouraged disciples to learn various cultivation methods and spells. A lot of the spells and cultivation methods that could be bought in the Treasure Pavilion came from other sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian became more and more fond of Zhao Jiuge. There was no flaw in his character and heart. Although his talent was a bit lacking, that could be made up for with hard work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge had reached the Foundation Realm and met the requirements to enter the inner sect, there was still one last trial he had to face. He was afraid that Zhao Jiuge could not pass it, and it was something everyone had to go through—not even he could change it. At this moment, Jian Wuxian revealed a hint of worry.</span></p>
