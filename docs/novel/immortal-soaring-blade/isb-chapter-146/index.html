 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

        })();

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became silent. The villagers stared at the beautiful, young girl. No one thought that such a young girl would be able to do something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression was a bit heavy. He looked at Bai Qingqing and asked, “What exactly are you doing? Could it be that you want to act against ordinary people?” Zhaoi Jiuge couldn’t figure out why Bai Qingqing would suddenly reveal her power before ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing still coldly looked at the old man and ignored Zhao Jiuge. It was not because she wanted to bully these ordinary people, but because she suspected that the piece of dog shit they were talking about was Han Songcheng. These villages wouldn’t shed a tear until they saw the coffin. If she didn’t reveal some of her might, they wouldn't easily open their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment of shock, panic appeared on everyone’s faces. The first to react was Er Huzi. Although he was a little afraid, he held onto the hoe in his hand. He stepped before the old man and angrily shouted, “And you say you guys aren’t working for that piece of dog shit? You even know immortal spells!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the puzzled Zhao Jiuge relaxed a bit and understood Bai Qingqing’s actions. Immortal spells—that meant there were other cultivators here beside them, and it would mostly likely be Han Songcheng. These villagers should know a bit about Han Songcheng’s situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from Zhao Jiuge, the old man’s expression also changed a bit. He was not afraid of them like the other villagers. Instead, he seemed to remember something, and there was hesitation on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the old man was hesitating, the other villagers responded after a moment of shock. Their hands turned white from clenching the tools in their hands. They were all shouting, but due to the power Bai Qingqing had displayed, they were afraid to step up like Er Huzi. At this moment, there were no less than 300 people gathered here. Most were young adult men, and even some of the older women were mixed in. However, there were no signs of any young women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I only want you to tell me about this piece of dog shit. Are you going to speak?” Bai Qingqing’s brow furrowed. She hadn’t expected the villagers to react like this even after she showed off her might. This made her even more certain that this matter was related to Han Songcheng. She was also curious about what exactly had happened here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, Er Huzi revealed a look of contempt and was going to argue. At this time, the old man coughed a few times and slowly stepped forward, pushing aside Er Huzi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, be quiet.” The old man’s voice was not loud, but it was filled with might. The originally noisy villagers all quieted down until everyone was silent. They looked at the old man and waited for him to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were waiting for the old man’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because something happened in the village recently, there was a misunderstanding. I hope the two of you won’t blame them. Since you want to know what happened, how about you follow me into the village and you can learn about what is going on?” Although the old man was old, his voice was filled with strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old man finished speaking, the villagers erupted once more and became very noisy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Er Huzi wasn’t the one who was shocked. Another middle-aged man who looked very similar also became agitated. His bear-like body quickly arrived before the old man and he shouted, “Village Chief, don’t lead the wolves inside. They know immortal spells and are obviously with those people. You don’t have to invite them into the village. At most, we all die here instead of letting them mess with the girls in our village!” At the end, the burly middle-aged man’s voice was filled with anger and sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the people standing in front quickly followed the middle-aged man’s words. After a while, Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge almost completely understood the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong, dong, dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old village chief used all his strength and banged his cane against the ground a few times. Perhaps because he had used too much strength, his face turned rose-red. Then he let out a hysterical howl. “Am I still the village chief!? Are you all still willing to listen to me?! Although I’m old, I’m not blind. Do you think I’ll try to harm you all?!” He coughed a few times while he spoke. This scared the middle-aged man and Er Huzi. They quickly went up to the old village chief and didn’t dare to say another word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old village chief took a few breaths, he continued, “All of you, go back to what you were doing. Er Huzi and Big Bear will stay with me. If I need anything, I’ll inform you all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man was who the old village chief called Big Bear. Although he was unconvinced, he still listened to the old village chief. “Listen to the Village Chief and leave. Er Huzi and I will stay to look after the Village Chief.” He waved his hand, motioning for people to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this situation, the villagers that had gathered walked back to their homes while occasionally staring back at the two strange visitors with vigilant gazes. The crowd gradually thinned. Seeing people taking the lead, others followed. The villagers holding farming tools went back to the farms to work. Only a few people who had nothing to do remained to see what was going to happen. They stood there, whispering to each other, and would occasionally point at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the villagers leave, the old village chief being supported by Big Bear said, “I let you guys see such an embarrassing situation. Oh, I don’t know where you two came from.” After he finished speaking, the old village chief looked at the two of them. He was very wise and knew how to deal with the situation at hand, so he spoke appropriately. Most importantly, the old village chief had decided that these two obviously weren’t working for that piece of dog shit. When Bai Qingqing revealed her power, the old village chief didn’t care about her identity, but wondered if he could get these two who also knew immortal spells to get rid of the evil that could use immortal spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Village Chief, we are disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect from more than 350 kilometers away. We came because of an order from our sect to get rid of an evil doer. My junior sister is just anxious and didn’t mean to offend anyone. She just wants to know if that piece of dog shit is the person we are looking for.” When Zhao Jiuge said the words “junior sister,” he didn’t forget to look at Bai Qingqing. Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes but was too lazy to refute him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Zhao Jiuge introduce himself and that he was here to get rid of an evil doer, Er Huzi and Big Bear looked at him with doubt in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the old village chief nodded without showing any doubt. From the young man’s clear eyes and sincere expression, the old village chief believed him. After all, the longer you live, the wiser you become. The old village chief at least believed that his judgement in people was not wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, so that’s how it is. Let us talk inside the village. Please, this way.” The old village chief nodded in relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he turned to walk into the village with the help of Big Bear. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing quickly followed. Only Er Huzi stayed behind, still unconvinced. He watched Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s backs with vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, Zhao Jiuge curiously observed this village. As they went further into the village, he saw some young girls. They looked at Zhao Jiuge with curiosity about a stranger and a trace of fear. Half of the village was built into the mountain, so when they got further in, they began walking up a hill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they walked, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing could not endure it anymore. They finally asked the old village chief about what had happened. They asked why the atmosphere in the village was so solemn and who that piece of dog shit they had mentioned was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old village chief talked about the origin of this matter, Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge were filled with anger. This confirmed their guess. The piece of dog shit they were talking about was indeed Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turned out that the area a few dozen kilometers around Yellow Flower Ridge had been occupied by Han Songcheng. He was the king of this area, and he did all the evil he wished. Not only had he taken control of the rogue cultivators in the area, he had personally killed those that didn’t listen to him with his Foundation Realm cultivation. He had even killed and robbed cultivators that had passed by.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He kidnapped people from the surrounding dozens of villages. When there was a slightly beautiful girl, they would be taken. As for what happened to those girls, one could easily imagine. Not only were these people helpless against Han Songcheng himself, he also had some of the surrounding rogue cultivators following him in his crime spree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was even more infuriating was that when he came to kidnap the girls from the villages, he personally killed the other villagers. This not only scared the villagers, it even made some of them try to please him. They told Han Songcheng where the girls were hiding inside the village. Iron Mouth Village was at the edge of Yellow Flower Ridge, so they hadn’t been harassed by those pieces of dog shit yet. However, a few days ago, they heard that a few of the nearby villages had been visited by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, when Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing arrived, the villagers mistook them for Han Songcheng’s people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the old village chief finished speaking, Er Huzi, who had been quiet this whole time, excitedly said, “I estimate that those damn dogs will arrive in a few days. When they come, even if I give up this life, I won’t let those pieces of dog shit take away a single girl from this village, much less my sister!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to the evil things Han Songcheng had done to the villagers, Bai Qingqing was so angry that she could not calm her heart for a long time. As a woman herself, when she heard Er Huzi’s words, she was even more angry. “Don’t worry, we came here to deal with that scum.” Thinking about what had happened to those young girls, Bai Qingqing clenched her teeth in anger. She wanted to find Han Songcheng right now to vent her anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Er Huzi felt a bit of disdain toward Bai Qingqing. Although what Bai Qingqing had displayed at the village entrance was amazing, he didn’t think she could clean up Han Songcheng’s evil-filled camp, not to mention she was just a little girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was a flash of hope in the old village chief’s eyes. Although these two were young, they had immortal spells, so ordinary people couldn’t comprehend them. Didn’t the old Daoist at the foot of the hill often say this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing noticed the disdain in Er Huzi’s eyes, her temper flared up again. She stopped walking and looked at Er Huzi, her red lips curled up.</span></p>
