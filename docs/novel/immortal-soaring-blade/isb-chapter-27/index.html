 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hands formed a seal that caused the white sword to buzz and the light to become even brighter. It was like a white snake that hadn’t eaten for days and could no longer wait to pounce on its prey. It shot out without any delay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge also gently moved his hands, and the spirit light around him became even stronger. He now gave off an unspeakable sense of majesty. Feeling the extraordinary auras around the two of them, everyone knew that it was about time to decide the victor. They were all looking forward to the results, but at the same time, they were wondering where the Mo family had found such a youth. At such a young age, he was able to compete with Xiao Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Mo family side, Mo Longjie was still calm, but his expression was a bit more serious. Old Mo looked calm on the surface, but if one looked closer, his wrinkled, old hand was trembling slightly. As for the rest of the Mo family, they were all breathing slowly, as if something heavy was weighing upon them. Even the old daoist was smiling as he looked at the two youths. It had been a long time since he last saw a battle this interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no more hesitation as the white sword trembled violently and shot forward. It turned from one to two, two to four, four to eight, and as it flew, the amount of sword shadows increased. The power was even stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge only saw a white sword turn into a ray of light that flew toward him before turning into countless swords that rained down upon him. He took a deep breath and revealed a determined gaze. His hand formed a seal and golden light surrounded his body like the blazing sun at noon. It was a dazzling sight for everyone watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then the countless swords rained down on Zhao Jiuge. The white light collided with the golden light and began melting like snow under the blazing sun. Soon, all the white light disappeared to everyone’s shock, while the golden light around Zhao Jiuge only dimmed a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The uproar spread out from the center like a wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did this youth come from? He is so young, yet he actually has the upper hand against Xiao Yun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Like I said, it's unknown who will win this yet. Although the Xiao family has hugged the thigh of the Flowing Cloud Sect, the Mo family’s background is not easy to mess with. Not to mention there is also this mysterious youth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you all think? For this youth to be so strong at such a young age, who do you think his teacher is? He must be very powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the noise from the surroundings entered Xiao Yun’s ears, he felt like a needle had stabbed into his heart. Only he knew that he had gone all-out on that attack, but Zhao Jiuge was unharmed. How ironic it looked now compared to when he was talking so big before everyone earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Feng’s proud expression changed and became ugly. Although his junior brother was young and his talent was lacking, he was still better than most. He had also received the teachings of the Flowing Cloud Sect. Liu Feng hadn’t expected his junior brother to be smacked in the face by this youth. He was secretly pondering in his heart how to show off the strength of the Flowing Cloud Sect without losing face for the sect. As for the rogue cultivators, he didn’t care about them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the people of the Mo family all subconsciously felt relieved. Mo Longjie was actually smiling and he felt like he had done the right thing in investing in Zhao Jiuge. Old Mo’s beard was trembling from excitement and joy. Mo Linger’s hands were clenched into little fists and her eyes were filled with admiration. It was as if she had just seen how cool and handsome Big Brother Jiuge looked when they first met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zheng Jie had a face full of viciousness and eyes full of envy while staring at the back of Zhao Jiuge. Before, he had decided that he was not discouraged and felt that as long as he stayed on the path, he would one day surpass Zhao Jiuge. However, now he realized that the gap was not something that time could close. This began to twist Zheng Jie’s mentality and personality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, even a firefly dares to compete against the bright moon. You dare to compare yourself to the bright moon. I let you hit me for so long, now it's my turn.” Zhao Jiuge was very angry when Xiao Yun injured him earlier. He was always someone that repaid others in kind, so now he no longer held back and formed the final seal of the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The originally dim light around Zhao Jiuge slowly shined again and the spirit force inside him decreased rapidly. The golden dragon that had been swimming inside Zhao Jiuge rushed out of his body and let out a roar toward the sky. Its eyes were filled with pride, and it charged toward Xiao Yun with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The roar of the dragon echoed through the air, causing their hearts to stop. The lower level cultivators’ faces turned white and they lost their thoughts for a moment due to a simple roar! Xiao Yun was shocked by the sudden appearance of the golden dragon, feeling its power. He just stared at it like an idiot and didn't recover until the dragon was already closing in. He used all the spirit force he had to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden dragon smashed into Xiao Yun’s body and broke the spirit force around him like cutting tofu. He flew back dozens of meters and coughed out blood while still flying through the air. When he fell to the ground, it was unknown if he was still breathing or not. He was no longer handsome like earlier—his clothes were torn and his upper body was a bloody mess. There was not a patch of undamaged skin on his upper body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge accidently discovered this when he went into the mountains after reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm to experience using spirit force outside his body. This was a joyous surprise for Zhao Jiuge as he had been lacking an ability to attack. He didn’t think that the Sanskrit Divine Body that he thought was a bit useless had this use. Zhao Jiuge also felt that once his cultivation became stronger, there would be more uses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was completely silent. This attack had shocked everyone here, it was too terrifying. Although they didn’t know what it was, they could feel the powerful aura, causing them all to look at the youth in shock. At this moment, the corner of Zhao Jiuge’s mouth was twitching and his eyes were filled with shock as well. He hadn’t expected it to be this powerful, but it also used a lot of spirit force. Right now, he had almost no spirit force left in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Xiao Zhan who reacted first. Seeing Xiao Yun’s serious injuries, he immediately rushed forward. The entire crowd was still in shock, but at this moment, the eyes of three people among them were shining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old daoist’s eyes were bright as he observed Zhao Jiuge, but no one knew what he was thinking. His lips trembled, but then it seemed like he thought of something else and closed his eyes. Liu Feng frowned in anger and quickly put some unknown pill into Xiao Yun’s mouth. Then he stood there, staring angrily at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also greed in his eyes, and shouted with ill intent, “You sure are bold, daring to injure a Flowing Cloud Sect disciple. Quickly hand over that spell if you know what’s good for you; otherwise, I’ll bring you back to the Flowing Cloud Sect.” After pondering a bit, greed won out. Although he had thought about Zhao Jiuge having a teacher, power decided everything in the end. After seeing the power of that move, he lost to the greed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Liu Feng’s words, Zhao Jiuge secretly regretted exposing his own strength, which now had caused trouble with the Flowing Cloud Sect. He was wondering how to deal with the situation, and there was some panic in his eyes. Liu Feng’s roar had awakened the crowd and their eyes were all burning as this play was not over. Originally, they thought it was over with the three matches, but now the large beast that was the Flowing Cloud Sect was going to intervene.</span></p>
