 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that dazzling light and thunderous rumble dissipated, everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After determining that there was nothing wrong anymore, a few birds began to chirp once more. Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing and swallowed. That was too violent. If that was used against him, even if he could resist, he estimated he wouldn't fare much better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing revealed no expression after easily killing Vulture. She put the terrifying hairpin back into her hair. At this moment, she had an aura of calmness and no longer had the alluring feeling she normally gave off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Zhao Jiuge thought of this, this image was broken. Bai Qingqing suddenly looked at Zhao Jiuge and angrily said, “What are you looking at? Have you never seen your elder sister so mighty?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly became speechless and his face helplessly twitched. He muttered something in his heart. After speaking to Zhao Jiuge, Bai Qingqing took out the small bottle filled with Little Huan Pills. She gently poured out a pill into her palm. Then her tender fingers grabbed the dark red pill and put it in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, we’ll go inside to find Han Songcheng. Only after killing him will the mission be complete.” In order to kill Vulture as soon as possible, she hadn’t hesitated to use the spirit treasure in her hair. The more powerful a treasure, the more spirit force it would take to use. Right now, Bai Qingqing was out of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge excitedly gathered the magic treasures from the enemies from before, the Twilight Drum, and the blood-colored sword and put them in his storage ring. He happily smiled while facing Bai Qingqing. “I know Big Sister Qingqing doesn’t care about these things.” Just because Bai Qingqing didn't care, that didn’t mean Zhao Jiuge didn’t care. Even if he couldn’t use them, he could still sell them to the sect for sect contributions. He wanted to refine one or two practical treasures before the selection. The cost of a flying sword was too great. He needed a good sword embryo so that the quality of the flying sword would be high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Looking at you, you're satisfied with only so little.” Bai Qingqing’s face was filled with contempt, but she had grown used to Zhao Jiuge’s thick skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, put them away and we’ll go. You’ll have to be careful, I don’t have any spirit force to help you. I’ll have to wait for the effect of the Little Huan Pill to kick in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was very bold. Even with Han Songcheng remaining, she had used her spirit treasure to kill Vulture. Even though all her spirit force was exhausted, she didn’t care. This was probably because Zhao Jiuge was still here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After gathering everything, Zhao Jiuge nodded in satisfaction. He then took out a Little Huan Pill and put it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smelled a faint smell of medicine, but then a spicy taste spread through his mouth. He only had about 50% of this spirit force left, and he began to recover rapidly. This made Zhao Jiuge’s eyes light up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A noise that suddenly came from the courtyard, attracting their attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Han Songcheng heard Vulture’s voice filled with anger and sorrow, he knew something bad had happened. He stopped recovering and immediately charged outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Han Songcheng was holding his long, grey sword and looked at everything with shock and fear. He didn’t think everyone under him, including Vulture, would be killed in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the blood-stained grass and severed limbs on the ground, he didn’t need to see the battle to know how tragic it was. Although he couldn’t spot Vulture’s body, that scream just now told him what Vulture’s fate was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng had ruled Yellow Flower Ridge for 20 years, and in one day, he was the only one left. Looking around, he was at a loss because everything was suddenly gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, the grief in his heart suddenly turned to anger. Zhang Long, Luo Xuqing, Vulture, and all the other familiar faces appeared in his mind. Although they were all his subordinates, he was still human. After being together for so many years, he had some attachment to them. Han Songcheng sincerely hated Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing—he wanted to cut them into thousands of pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture’s last words continued to assault Han Songcheng’s heart. This made him panic. In truth, Vulture had misunderstood Han Songcheng. Although he cherished his life, he just wanted to recover more spirit force so he could battle at his peak. He hadn’t expected Vulture to be killed so quickly. First, his plan was to use the illusion formation and Zhang Long to stall them until he and Vulture had mostly recovered. Then he could siege them both with everyone. Who knew that when he came out, the situation would be like this? He was furious, but he was too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahahaha…. I’m going to cut you two bastards into thousands of pieces!” Han Songcheng seemed to have gone crazy, his eyes were bloodshot. His hair scattered and he brandished the grey sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Han Songcheng, who seemed to have been possessed by a devil, Zhang Jiuge and Bai Qingqing had different expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing snorted in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt nothing for this kind of piece of dog shit who lacked humanity. Perhaps if you asked Zhao Jiuge to kill a dog, he might feel softhearted, but when killing Han Songcheng, who was lower than a dog, Zhao Jiuge felt nothing. In his eyes, Han Songcheng was just a bunch of sect contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a faint smile, Zhao Jiuge looked at the crazed Han Songcheng and charged forward without waiting for Han Songcheng to act. At this moment, his battle intent surged to an unprecedented level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was not afraid of battling a late stage Foundation Realm enemy with his mid stage Foundation Realm cultivation. He wanted this to be a painful battle, he wanted to experience the benefits of actual combat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he even arrived, Zhao Jiuge’s mid stage Foundation Realm cultivation erupted. The temperature of the air around them dropped a few degrees and his golden spirit force mixed with an ice-blue fog surged out. After tempering his body, Zhao Jiuge liked to directly weaken the enemy with his spirit force first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold snort came from Han Songcheng’s nose. He squinted and recovered to normal. He had a belly full of rage and had nowhere to vent it. He saw that Bai Qingqing was already exhausted, so now he only had to think about killing the boy. He would figure out how to deal with that little minx later. Thinking about this, Han Songcheng’s bloodshot eyes burned with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another surge of spirit force appeared, and grey spirit force rushed into the air. Facing the youth who was weaker than him, Han Songcheng didn’t consider Zhao Jiuge a threat. Just like this, the two waves of spirit force collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding trees rustled and the grass on the ground swayed back and forth. Their spirit force was equal! Han Songcheng’s eyebrows rose and he was shocked by this. There had to be something strange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he had recovered 80% of his spirit force. Facing the exhausted Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge, who was at a lower cultivation level, Han Songcheng was confident. Even if something strange happened, he was confident he could escape. This was his confidence in his strength after years of experience.</span></p>

He learned it when he was young from a rogue cultivator who became his teacher. However, after Han Songcheng figured out that the person who was his teacher didn’t give him the second part of the cultivation method, he brutally attacked his teacher. He threatened his teacher’s life to get the second half of the cultivation method and then mercilessly killed him.&nbsp;</span></p>

A few strands of his hair fluttered in the wind.</span></p>

Use force against force, violence against violence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng coldly looked at everything. A brat was still a brat—what was the point of releasing all that spirit force? It was just a waste of spirit force to show off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only when he saw Zhao Jiuge close in and he could feel the sharpness of the blue longsword did Han Songcheng’s spirit force surge out into his grey longsword.</span></p>

Han Songcheng’s clothes were cut and he was forced back a few steps. The hand he was holding the sword with was a little stiff, and a bone chilling coldness had drilled into his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng was awakened from his madness by this chilling cold. Even the rage in his heart had dissipated a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge wave was set off in his heart. What was this youth’s background? Although his cultivation level was lower, his spirit force was equal to Han Songcheng’s. Moreover, his spirit force was much more domineering. Han Songcheng’s heart was filled with doubt, and he even gave up on the idea of getting revenge for his men. His eyes shined and he looked for a path of escape! If he had to leave Yellow Flower Ridge, with his strength, he knew he could find a new place to go to. Even without his subordinates, he could do as he wished on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this idea appeared in his mind, Han Songcheng no longer desired to fight to the death. While he was battling Zhao Jiuge, he secretly moved to a more open location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After forcing Zhao Jiuge back, his back was no longer facing Zhao Jiuge or Bai Qingqing. He brandished his sword three times and then turned without looking at the result. He controlled his flying sword and was about to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Zhao Jiuge let him escape? Once he noticed Han Songcheng’s intent, he frowned unhappily. He quickly activated the Sanskrit Divine Body and the two golden dragons inside his dantian immediately rushed out. After cultivating for so long, the two golden dragons had recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dragon roars echoed in the sky. Han Songcheng had already stepped onto his flying sword, but he felt the bitter chill and sense danger behind him. However, he didn’t dare to look back, because he was afraid it was going to delay his escape. It wasn’t like he did nothing after sensing the danger. Grey light wrapped around his body, forming a layer of armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two golden dragons instantly caught up and collided with Han Songcheng’s back. The armor made of spirit force was broken in an instant and there were flashes of light from Han Songcheng’s body. He was knocked more than a dozen meters away, and the grey flying sword fell because no one was controlling it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng, who was knocked to the ground, started to cough out blood. His back had sunk in from being hit. Fortunately, his body was different from that of a mortal, so there was no immediate danger to his life. The armor around him had resisted most of the attack and saved his life, but he was too weak to use any spirit force to fight. The meridians in his body were also severely injured. Lying on the ground, Han Songcheng checked his physical condition and his face turned ashen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, a moment later, Zhao Jiuge’s Little Huan Pill kicked in and Bai Qingqing had recovered some spirit force. The two of them caught up with their flying swords in hand. They looked at the weakened Han Songcheng with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge viciously kicked at Han Songcheng with his right foot and roared, “Try to run again! After doing so many evil things and bullying mortals, you want to run?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s body only trembled a bit after being kicked, then he became motionless again. Blood was already flowing from his mouth, and now he coughed out a big mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s brows furrowed and he coughed in pain. He struggled to move as if he wanted to get up. His mouth trembled—it seemed like he wanted to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge wondered if Han Songcheng still wanted to play a trick. However, the next scene shocked Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>

Please give me a chance.” After he finished speaking, he struggled to turn his injured body. He knelt down on the ground and his hands clapped together.</span></p>
