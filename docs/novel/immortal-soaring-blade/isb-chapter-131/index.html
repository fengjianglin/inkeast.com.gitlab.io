<div id="announcement-body-119486" class="fr-view panel-body hidden"> 
 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/2021-roadmap-site-redesign-karma-changes-ebooks-more">Read More...</a> </p>

        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";
                }
            }
        })();

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only yin objects like zombies could form Yin Spirit Beads, and only talented ones at that. They had to at least be at the Foundation Realm, then they would have to find a spirit vein to refine their body and spirit force like humans. After fulfilling these conditions, they could condense their yin energy into a Yin Spirit Bead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every Yin Spirit Bead had a different attribute—it would depend on the spirit vein used. The Yin Spirit Bead would have the same attribute as the spirit vein. In general, after cultivating a Yin Spirit Bead, their strength would increase greatly. Their spirit force would also become more domineering because it had an attribute! It could be said that the Three-tailed Yin Cat was guaranteed to enter the Spirit Core Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greyish-white Yin Spirit Bead floated above the Three-tailed Yin Cat and exuded a greyish-white light. The bead was only the size of a grain of rice—the Three-tailed Yin Cat must have just started cultivating it. Zhao Jiuge deduced that there had to be a spirit vein nearby, but it shouldn’t be very big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Zhao Jiuge’s heart became somewhat numb, and the joy from injuring the Three-tailed Yin Cat had disappeared. After all, the disparity in strength was big. Zhao Jiuge’s last chance was for the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery to recover and hope he could do something. Zhao Jiuge pursed his lips and became determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dim, golden dragons coiled in the air, flew up into the sky, and then dove into the ground. Seeing Zhao Jiuge not giving up, the Three-tailed Yin Cat became angry. It raised its head and the Yin Spirit Bead slowly rose up to the sky. The greyish-white light spread out and the surroundings suddenly became colder. The two golden dragons accelerated toward the Yin Spirit Bead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat waved its paw with disdain, sending spirit force surging out. This spirit force was even stronger than before due to the attribute of the Yin Spirit Bead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The monstrous spirit force swept past the two golden dragons, making them remain motionless like time had stopped. A few seconds later, the two golden dragons slowly dissipated. Zhao Jiuge coughed out a mouthful of blood—the backlash caused intense pain in his dantian. All the meridians in his body were damaged to a certain degree, and his entire body felt like it was freezing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat had cultivated a Yin Spirit Bead with the cold attribute—it must have found a spirit vein before with a cold attribute. Zhao Jiuge’s body trembled while thinking. Then he checked his own physical condition and couldn’t help but laugh at himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood on the corner of his mouth was very eye-catching and his face was as white as wax. He was seriously injured and he had less than 10% of his spirit force left. Zhao Jiuge had somewhat resigned to his fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, he relaxed. He had done his best, and he let out a mouthful of foul air. He then looked at the moon hanging up in the sky. Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but feel emotional. He was not afraid of death, he was afraid of not fulfilling the promise he had made to the teary-eyed girl when he chose to enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Also, he was a bit reluctant. When he joined the sect, he thought he was close to catching that woman, but now she seemed so far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man’s blue sword robe was covered in bloodstains that looked like embroidered flowers. The cloth that he had used to tie up his hair had been lost during the battle. His black hair was scattered, and the wind blew some of his black hair onto his handsome face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qingshan suddenly seemed to age dozens of years and sighed. He knew that the young man had tried his best, and at his age, he didn’t regret too much. He only held his family a little tighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat confidently walked toward Zhao Jiuge. The Yin Spirit Bead floated in the sky, releasing a cold fog. When the Three-tailed Yin Cat was about three meters away from Zhao Jiuge, it stopped. Its green eyes glowed while looking at Zhao Jiuge, and it licked its lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled softly. Was it prepared to suck his essence blood? Zhao Jiuge was calm, like he had seen through everything. His slightly childish face became old. While he was looking at the Three-tailed Yin Cat, his mind was thinking about his childhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft sword melody echoed and interrupted Zhao Jiuge’s thoughts. He looked down at the Blue Plum Sword in his hand. It had already dimmed, but it was letting out a soft hymn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the sword in his hand, Zhao Jiuge’s originally furrowed brows returned to normal and he became determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path of cultivation was life or death every step of the way. He had just joined the sect—was he going to let himself die here? Not even his partner, his sword, had given up, so how could he give up? How could the path of cultivation be smooth? Everything depended on his own struggle. This world was too wonderful, and he had only seen a small corner of it. The future awaited him, he couldn’t fall here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more Zhao Jiuge thought, the brighter his eyes became. At this moment, his sword robe fluttered without any wind. He raised his head and coldly stared at the Three-tailed Yin Cat. At this moment, although the sword light around him was dim, his killing intent was surging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he had less than 10% of his spirit force left, he wouldn’t give up until the last moment. He was unwilling to submit to his fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back at the cold water pool, he was looked down upon like an ant by that woman. That night, Zhao Jiuge questioned his heart to prove his dao. He was going to right all the unfairness in the world, kill all evil doers. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s dao heart became even more complete. A powerful person would experience transformations during life or death situations. Right now, Zhao Jiuge was on the path of undergoing a transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhao Jiuge, who was covered in injuries but seemed a bit different, made the Three-tailed Yin Cat confused. Zhao Jiuge no longer looked pathetic like before, and his aura was somewhat different. However, victory was in its grasp, so the Three-tailed Yin Cat didn’t think about it. Thinking about how its cultivation level would increase once it absorbed Zhao Jiuge’s essence blood, the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s eyes were filled with greed and it licked its lips. The Three-tailed Yin Cat stepped forward. This time, it was not going to waste time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat slowly walked toward the Zhao Jiuge. It thought he was merely putting up a dying struggle, but Zhao Jiuge shocked it once more. Zhao Jiuge also walked toward the Three-tailed Yin Cat. He had a smile on his face, and he raised the Blue Plum Sword before him. With each step, his momentum increased. He stared at the Three-tailed Yin Cat, who was filled with doubt, and laughed. He ignored the Three-tailed Yin Cat and continued to walk toward it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll hold my sword and laugh at the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when his strength wasn’t enough, he still had to face everything like a sharp sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the result, he had to be worthy of himself, worthy of his heart, and most importantly, worthy of the sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distance between the human and the cat became smaller and smaller—three meters, two meters, one meter. Zhao Jiuge was still walking calmly, but the Three-tailed Yin Cat could not hold back anymore. It pounced at Zhao Jiuge, intending to devour his essence blood to make itself stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the surging spirit force before the cat, Zhao Jiuge was still as calm as water—his head had never been so clear before. When he could feel tingling pain on his face, the Blue Plum Sword in his hand moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t do anything fancy at all. His hand turned, he raised his hand, and the remaining spirit force inside his body surged into the sword. Then a ray of sword energy flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still the Elucidation chapter, but at this moment, the sword energy was completely different from before—it seemed to be alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ray of sword energy was like a lonely boat in the raging sea when facing the spirit force from the Three-tailed Yin Cat. However, no matter how dangerous the waves were, the lonely boat remained fearless.</span></p>
