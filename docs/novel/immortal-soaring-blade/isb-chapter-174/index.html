 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all the new disciples landed, one of the older disciples from the Duty Hall who had a slightly majestic aura flew up slightly higher than the rest. He smiled faintly and took a deep breath. Then he roared, “The training has officially begun. The rest will depend on your performance. Senior Brother wishes you all good luck, don’t be beaten too badly. When you meet the disciples of the other two peaks, fight to your hearts' content.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man said that with a bit of killing intent. He then waved his hand and said, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost 100 figures nearly flew into the sky toward the Mysterious Heaven Square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the way back, the majestic-looking young man looked at his companion and said, “Do you think this generation of new disciples can win against those two peaks?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His older companion smiled bitterly and shook his head. “How could I know? I hope that they can do well and not lose us any face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they finished speaking, they both sighed and looked into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After those senior brothers left, there was a brief moment of silence at the foot of the mountain. Originally, there were sounds of birds and insects, but they all disappeared with the arrival of these disciples. The almost 100 disciples didn’t make a sound—they all just stood there, looking at each other. Zhao Jiuge could clearly feel his own heart beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time, it was Mu Zijun who stood out with a righteous aura. “I hope that we can put aside all our past grievances and work together against the other two peaks. Then we will head to the top together so no one falls behind and gets their flags taken, thus weakening our forces.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw Mu Zijun stand out, he quickly rebutted and laid out his own idea. “I agree with the first part, but not the second. Everyone moving together would create too big of a commotion and it would not be easy to support each other. I hope the weaker members will work together to weaken the enemies, while the stronger members split into two teams that will rush for the top. After all, it will depend on the Foundation Realm disciples to decide the winner. I think that no matter how talented the other two peaks are, they won’t have any Spirit Core disciples.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone thought for a while, but in the end, Wang Baiwan took a profound look at Zhao Jiuge and nodded. “I think that makes sense. Those without any Foundation Realm disciples in their group will head into the mountains to find the disciples of the other two peaks. Fight and steal their flags if possible and escape if not. Do your best to not have your flags taken. The Foundation Realm disciples will split into two groups and rush to the top. If you encounter any disciples from the other two peaks, let no one escape.” At the end, Wang Baiwan’s words became cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo talked in private for a bit before they looked at Zhao Jiuge. “This works. You take Leng Rufeng and Bai Qingqing, while we five will move as a group. I advise you to be careful and hope to see you at the peak. I don’t want to see our originally small number of Foundation Realm cultivators not even reach the peak.” Although he had agreed to Zhao Jiuge’s proposal, his words were strange and contained hidden intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s unknown who will not reach the peak, we’ll see,” Zhao Jiuge said with disdain. Although they were temporarily abandoning their internal dispute because of the training, that didn’t mean they would get along. After zhao Jiuge finished speaking he didn’t even look at Mu Zijun and came beside Luo Xie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge whispered to Luo Xie, “Later, you take a dozen people or so along some isolated paths. Help protect those that fall behind from the main group. Then delay for a while before rushing toward the peak. I believe the disciples of the other two peaks aren’t stupid and will certainly rush the peak. This will make the lower area safer for a while. As for the rest, decide for yourself. Try to capture as many flags as possible while not losing your own flag. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie secretly looked around and then nodded forcefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Luo Xie nod, Zhao Jiuge finally relaxed. He looked at the rest of them and finally said, “Then I’ll leave with Leng Rufeng. All of you, be careful. It’s still the same as before, follow Big Brother and you will eat well. After this training, I’ll make sure each of you has a flying sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge deliberately didn’t keep his voice low and caused an uproar. All of them looked at Zhao Jiuge with complicated gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge ignored those gazes. He left with the calm Bai Qingqing and the still-anxious Leng Rufeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the five Foundation Realm cultivators, Mu Zijun, Bai Zimo, the youth with the scar, Wang Baiwan, and Liu Yinger, headed toward the peak from another direction. Only Liu Yinger looked at Zhao Jiuge’s back from time to time with reluctance in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the remaining disciples were divided into two groups, and only a few disciples that always cultivated alone left by themselves. Similar situations had to be happening with the disciples of the other two peaks as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previously quiet forest was suddenly filled with flashes of light. Nearly ⅓ of the disciples took out treasures, while the rest remained empty-handed. After all, not everyone had treasures, since they had only entered the sect two years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flashes of light created a sharp contrast between the two groups, but those disciples without treasures were filled with hope. They believed that after this training, they would all obtain th 200 sect contributions and be able to buy the lowest grade flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All because Zhao Jiuge said “follow Big Brother and you will eat well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shortly after, this entire area quieted down, and not a shadow remained. Only the crushed, yellow leaves were still making some slight crackling sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gentle breeze blew by and kicked up the dead leaves into the air. The surrounding branches and flowers all shook because of this wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if they were saying that the exciting training exercise between the three peaks had officially begun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all these new disciples began to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a peak not far away from Wu Hua Peak, another scene was unfolding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the peak of an unnamed mountain, there was a huge, yellow, striped rock on the edge of a cliff. Head Teacher Jian Wuxian was looking into the depths of Wu Hua Peak with his profound gaze. He had both his hands behind his back. The mountain wind was strong, causing his long robe to flutter, but he remained motionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On his left side was the cold-faced Jian Wuxie. The only difference was that the usually indifferent Jian Wuxie had a rare trace of interest in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the right was the charming and elegant Jian Wuxuan. He had a faint smile on his face. His charming eyes pierced into the depths of Wu Hua Peak, and he would nod from time to time. He was an existence that was unknown to the outside world. When he was young, he went outside once and then never again. No one in the sect knew of his prestige, but his strength was no weaker than his two senior brothers. Even though he was very lonely, he never left the sect and was a hidden ace for the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them were undoubtedly the higher-ups of the Mysterious Heaven Sect. Aside from the reclusive elders, they were in the highest seats of power in the sect. Among them, the least prestigious was Jian Wuxuan, who often interracted the disciples and gave them pointers. He was beloved by the disciples.</span></p>

This showed how important this training exercise was. Normally, they could just observe it with their divine senses; there was no need to come here personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them all looked into the depths of Wu Hua Peak, and none of them made a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the silence was soon broken. There was no flash of light or any sound of movement when a voice suddenly echoed. Then four figures appeared beside the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Head Teacher, it has been a long time since you had the free time to personally take care of these little fellows.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tall and burly man wearing a scholar shirt with a scarf on his head and a sword on his back appeared. The middle-aged man looked at Jian Wuxian with a smile on his face, but his eyes were not smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him was a slightly thin, middle-aged man wearing a plain, black robe. There was nothing special about him. His hands were drooping and he stood behind everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, what Head Seat Du says is right. If not for today’s training, it would be very difficult to see the Head Teacher.” On the other side, an old man in beige linen and with white hair spoke with a smile. However, his words seemed to contain some hidden intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the old man in beige linen was an old man in grey hemp clothes. This old man was tall and thin, but the most unique part about him was his aquiline nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the four of them suddenly appear, Jian Wuxie and Jian Wuxuan’s expressions sank and they revealed unfriendly expressions. Both of them secretly frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, Jian Wuxuan looked at the burly man with the scarf with extreme disgust. He wondered why the Head Seat of the Mysterious Strange Peak, Du Junping, was here, and he had even brought his younger brother, Du Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Junping was burly like a man, but his heart was like that of a woman. Not only was he scheming, he was vicious and cold-hearted. His belly was filled with schemes, and Jian Wuxuan was filled with disgust toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the old man in beige linen, the Head Seat of the Mysterious Fallen Peak, Zhang Xu, he was a bit better than Du Junping. He focused all his heart on the sect, but over the years, he had become more and more arrogant. He wanted the Mysterious Fallen Peak to be above &nbsp;the Mysterious Heaven Peak and was after the position of Head Teacher. Although Head Teacher and Head Seat were only one word apart, the difference was like heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Head Teacher Jian Wuxian didn’t frown like Jian Wuxuan and Jian Wuxie. Instead, he acted like he didn’t see the hidden knives in their smiles. He faintly smiled and said, “These little fellows are the fresh blood of the sect. They are the foundation and will determine if the sect rises or falls in the next 100 years. How could I not care? Aren’t the two Head Seats the same? You also have the free time to come here and watch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian still acted the same as before—he didn’t even turn his head. The wind caused this purple robe to flutter, making him look even more majestic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven people on the peak were undoubtedly the higher-ups of the sect, excluding those elders cultivating in recluse. Now all of them had appeared for this training session between the new disciples.</span></p>
