 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with the three of you? Do you not remember me? What’s with your expressions?” Zhao Jiuge pretended to be relaxed and teased his three friends before him. However, he couldn’t hide his weakened state before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he looked around and wondered where Luo Xie, who loved to join in on the fun, had gone. He was surprised to not see him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing rolled her pretty eyes. She deliberately made a face and said in an unfriendly tone, “What’s wrong with this old lady’s expression? What do you have to say? How about we have a fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She raised her tender fist and cutely waved it. Although she said this, she was secretly observing Zhao Jiuge and felt relieved. No matter what, Zhao Jiuge had won his battle, and Bai Qingqing felt happy for her friend from the bottom of her heart. Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was still in the mood to tease her, the injuries shouldn’t be too serious. Instructor Zhou had also taken a look at Zhao Jiuge’s injuries. Unlike the hateful youth with the scar, who had been taken by Instructor Li to some unknown place to have his injuries treated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge smiled indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Bai Qingqing thought he was going to be silent and was going to continue mocking him, Zhao Jiuge’s weak voice rang in her ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think everyone is as violent as you? You’re always calling yourself an old lady at such a young age. Who would want you in the future? It would truly be bad luck to become your dao partner.” Zhao Jiuge knew Bai Qingqing’s temper. Even though his body was filled with pain after winning, he still couldn’t help but chuckle and quarrel with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s brows furrowed and her temper rose. She wanted to fight and teach this nasty fellow a lesson. On the side, Liu Yinger, who had a gaze of worship and some strange emotions, quickly pulled Bai Qingqing back. Her tone was anxious. “Okay, he just finished a fight and is covered in injuries, so don’t step down to his level. Let him go back and rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was bickering with Zhao Jiuge, every action was protective of him. Bai Qingqing couldn’t help but be amused, and a smirk appeared on her face. She looked at Liu Yinger with a “you understand” look, which caused Liu Yinger to suddenly become embarrassed and her face to turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shy expression caused Bai Qingqing to laugh out loud. At this moment, she no longer had a hint of her alluring self, she was like masculine warrior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge could not do anything about her. The corner of his mouth twitched. Wang Baiwan patiently smiled and watched the three of them chat. After the two girls finished laughing, he looked at Zhao Jiuge with a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Jiuge, I can’t believe we’ve only known each other for such a short period of time, but you are already beyond my reach. Today, I have no confidence in winning against you. By the way, congratulations, the prestige you gained in today’s battle is your biggest harvest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clasped his hands and no longer had the honest smile of the past. Instead, he had a dignified smile, and even the way he addressed Zhao Jiuge had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have thought that this ordinary-looking youth would shine so brightly shortly after entering the sect? It could be said that Zhao Jiuge had become famous on the Mysterious Heaven Peak after just one battle. In this holy land, the fame and prestige gained would have immeasurable benefits in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan looked at Zhao Jiuge with a complicated expression and let out a sigh in his heart. He felt a bit melancholy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wang Baiwan’s attitude and words, Zhao Jiuge was stunned for a while. He couldn’t react for a bit. It seemed Wang Baiwan’s words and actions had become more respectful but also more estranged. After a while, he understood that it was because what he had said on the stone platform had completely offended all the disciples from good families. The new disciples were now divided into two factions. Wang Baiwan was part of a good family, so he naturally couldn’t avoid being grouped with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People who walked different paths could not make plans together. He had his own friends and he had his own worries. This was understandable, but Zhao Jiuge’s words were not deliberately targeting them, it was unintentional. However, when they heard his unintentional words, they didn’t think so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge just opened his mouth to explain himself, but Wang Baiwan didn’t give him the chance. He quickly chuckled. “I have something to do, so you guys talk first.” After he finished speaking, he ignored the others and turned around, leaving them only his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This turn completely set the boundary between the two of them and also ended the sincere friendship they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Baiwan had his back to the three of them, his smile faded. Instead, there was a sense of melancholy and complication, with a trace of unclear regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan sighed in his heart once more. He wanted to live carefreely like before because he really valued this friendship, but he couldn’t help himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nothing in the world would go as one wished. Perhaps he hadn’t expected this result after the fight. It was ridiculous that he had thought he could win over Zhao Jiuge to fight for him when he returned home to fight for the inheritance. It was ridiculous, simply ridiculous, to the point that he couldn’t even say it in his heart. Wang Baiwan’s fat figure disappeared from their vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Wang Baiwan leave without waiting for him to explain, Zhao Jiuge felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort. He didn’t have any friends growing up, so he especially cherished the few friends he met after coming to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Now, due to his unintentional act, he had lost a friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about this, the joy from defeating the youth with the scar disappeared. He lowered his head with a sad expression and let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he always knew Wang Baiwan was not as simple and honest as he looked, that didn’t affect their friendship. However, he had a good impression of Wang Baiwan. Who didn’t have their own selfish desires? As long as it doesn’t harm anyone, he didn’t mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing clearly saw everything. She had grown up with a complicated family background, so since young, she was already very good at social relations. She had a much more sophisticated understanding of human relations compared to others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the contrary, the simple Liu Yinger looked at Wang Baiwan, who looked a little different today, and felt like something was strange. A puzzled look appeared on her face. She looked at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing and softly asked, “What’s wrong with Big Brother Baiwan today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge only responded with a wry smile and didn’t say a word. Bai Qingqing quickly comforted her, “It’s nothing. Maybe he really has something to do, so don’t worry.” Even Bai Qingqing had a good impression of this innocent girl. She didn’t want Zhao Jiuge and Wang Baiwan’s relationship to affect his lovely girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She hoped Liu Yinger could maintain her innocent and pure heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger was convinced by Bai Qingqing’s words and didn’t doubt her a bit. She frowned a bit before she softly said, “Then I’ll go check on him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished speaking, she looked at Zhao Jiuge with a shy smile. “You should go back early to heal your injuries. I’ll meet you at the beginning of next month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge smiled back at Liu Yinger’s kindness and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Liu Yinger left, Bai Qingqing let out a strange smile. “Oh, not bad, our Zhao Jiuge is becoming more and more attractive. There is even a young girl willing to embrace you. I think that after winning against the youth with the scar, even more young girls will become obsessed with you. Tsk, tsk, I really couldn’t tell before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was feeling inexplicably uncomfortable and was in no mood to quarrel with her. He directly ignored her words. His expression was flat and his eyes were in a daze, as if he was thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Zhao Jiuge ignore her, Bai Qingqing knew exactly what Zhao Jiuge was upset about, so she regained her serious expression. She said in a gentle tone, “Everything depends on strength. Today, you lost your friend and feel uncomfortable as a result, and there will be even more uncomfortable things in the future. What’s more, you’re a man, so you have to bear even more. No matter what happens, you must maintain your heart and keep your determination to move toward your goal. When you look back, you will view things differently.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever Bai Qingqing became serious, she had a special charm. This was the real her, the her that wore no mask. At this moment, she was not the alluring girl who teased him or the spoiled and temperamental Bai Qingqing that loved to quarrel with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Zhao Jiuge felt like Bai Qingqing’s words had a reason. Although he found it difficult to accept that a friend had left, that was because he didn’t have any friends growing up, so he really cherished his friendships. However, in reality, it was not a big deal. After seeing this rare expression from Bai Qingqing, Zhao Jiuge's depressed mood improved a bit because her words were quite reasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, as long as he guarded his heart and stuck to his own goals, that would be enough. When he met that noble and cold woman who shocked him with one strike and then glanced at him like he was an ant, his self-esteem was shattered, and at that moment, he questioned his own heart to confirm his dao. He understood his own heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also, wasn’t his goal to suppress that graceful figure? There were some personal thoughts mixed in as well. Those feelings were only known to him. When he thought about this, he suddenly felt cheerful and his expression was no longer as depressed. He finally saw past the dark clouds and spotted the bright sun. He let out a smile. He wanted to praise Bai Qingqing, but who would guess that she would speak once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, something is wrong. You can’t be considered a man. At most you’re a little boy, and a little boy who hasn’t grown up yet.” When she said this, Bai Qingqing laughed inexplicably and smirked. She glanced at Zhao Jiuge’s pants, and the words “hasn’t grown up yet” were particularly articulated. After speaking, she pinched Zhao Jiuge’s face like he was a child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s face immediately turned red and hot. Although he didn’t understand too much about that, he still knew some things. Girls matured earlier than boys, and Bai Qingqing was two years older than Zhao Jiuge. When he heard her teasing him, he suddenly felt ashamed and quickly dodged her hands that were pinching his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little flustered as he threw out one line. “I’ll go back to recover, I’ll see you next week.” And then he fled in a panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha.” She laughed loudly when she saw Zhao Jiuge running away with a red face filled with embarrassment. There was no image of a lady in her. Looking at Zhao Jiuge, who was fleeing despite his injuries, the girl shouted once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Brother, since you’re injured, do you want Big Sister to take you back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge frowned as he was running and forcibly endured the pain. When he heard her last words, he staggered and almost fell to the ground. Seeing this, Bai Qingqing laughed even harder. Zhao Jiuge no longer cared about anything, he just quickly ran back to his residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wooden house he lived in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge sat down on the wooden bed. He didn’t rush to recover, he was just thinking about his own worries. It was clearly someone else who had provoked him into the fight, so why had he still lost one of the few precious friends he had?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he started to think about random things until his thoughts became chaotic and he became upset. Finally, he thought about Bai Qingqing’s words and decided to forget about this matter. He was going to cultivate to recover his injuries and increase his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Zhao Jiuge heard footsteps closing in from afar.</span></p>
