 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powerful spirit force fluctuations quickly gathered at the tip of the wooden sword. Accompanied by the roaring thunder, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery waved the sword and pointed it at the Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous rumble echoed and a ray of white light flew toward the Green Haired Zombie. This divine thunder immediately landed on the Green Haired Zombie. Its body twitched nonstop, then it turned completely black and fell to the ground. It was still trembling and tried to stand up, but as the yin energy around it decreased, its struggle became weaker and weaker. Now it only occasionally twitched a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was dumbfounded while staring at this. He thought that this old Daoist really did have some skills. That divine thunder just now was simply too amazing. However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t know that this was merely the beginning. As a Daoist’s cultivation level increased, the divine thunder would be as thick as one’s waist and be even more amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge slowly walked over and said toward the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery, “Not bad, it seems you have some skills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s face was pale, when he heard Zhao Jiuge’s praise, he couldn’t help but feel proud. Just as he was about to brag, the Green Haired Zombie that had fallen to the ground began to struggle. This shocked him greatly, and he exhausted his remaining energy and kicked the Green Haired Zombie. The zombie fell to the ground once more, and the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery also weakly fell to the ground. The little Daoist boy who had been hiding in the corner quickly ran up to help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the exhausted spirit force in his body, he felt helpless. That spell was very good, but it had consumed too much spirit force. Just creating a divine thunder the size of a snake had drained all his spirit force. He half leaned against his disciple and looked at the startled Zhao Jiuge. He then anxiously shouted, “What are you standing there for? The Green Haired Zombie isn’t dead yet. Quickly, break its dantian, then it won’t be able to cause any more problems.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the weakened Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery, Zhao Jiuge was too lazy to argue. He slowly walked up to the Green Haired Zombie, and a powerful stench pounced at him. He could see that the severed arm was still trembling and its skin was charred black. The foul stench combined with the smell of burning flesh was simply too disgusting. Zhao Jiuge was a bit reluctant to use his Blue Plum Sword to destroy its dantain, because it was just too disgusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge retreated a few steps and then raised his hand. There was a flash of light and the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd appeared in his grasp. Since the source of the problem was destroyed and he still had 40% of his spirit force left, he’d rather do this than let his Blue Plum Sword come into contact with the disgusting zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A monstrous amount of true fire surrounded the struggling Green Haired Zombie. The fire wrapped itself around the Green Haired Zombie like a snake. Then the fire still grew and crackling sounds echoed. A few seconds later, the Green Haired Zombie stopped struggling and was slowly burnt to ashes. When it completely disappeared, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery finally relaxed. Although he had exhausted all his spirit force, at least the Green Haired Zombie had been dealt with. However, when he saw Zhao Jiuge’s Purple Gold True Fire Gourd, there was a flash of greed in his eyes. That flash of greed quickly disappeared, but his heart was burning with greed. That treasure was a precious treasure and was almost as good as his whisk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His expression returned to normal, but his eyes were shining. He pretended to casually ask, “I didn’t expect you to have such a powerful treasure. What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Purple Gold True Fire Gourd. Since you said only fire or thunder attributes can deal with it, I suddenly remembered I had this. I obtained this by accident.” Zhao Jiuge had responded very casually but didn’t mention Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly remembered that Daoist Yi Qing and the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery were both Daoists. His heart tightened and he became more on guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge turned and saw the yin energy slowly disperse with the destruction of the Green Haired Zombie. There was a smile on his handsome face because the Green Haired Zombie had been eliminated. The Yu family, led by Yu Qingshan, also came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he came out, Yu Qingshan’s face smiled from excitement and he said, “Oh, both of you are benefactors to my Yu family. We thank you greatly, we will forever remember your kindness in our hearts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery slowly got up with the help of his disciple. He carefully dusted his cuffs and said, “It’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, the weakened Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery suddenly lost his cool. His eyes widened and he shouted, “Not good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw the yin energy that had disappeared after the Green Haired Zombie was defeated suddenly return. This time, the yin energy was even stronger than the Green Haired Zombie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge reacted due to the cry from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. He saw the yin energy surge toward the Yu family’s ancestral home. The yin energy surged toward them from all directions like a black wave. The two of them stared at this in fear, but the people from the Yu family were confused. They looked toward that direction but saw nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery looked frightened and his hands started trembling. He sucked in a breath of cold air and said, “It turns out that there was another culprit behind this matter. The Green Haired Zombie was already difficult enough, and the true culprit’s yin energy is even stronger. How can this be? I didn’t notice anything suspicious when I arrived at the village. It’s over, it's over! Now that I’ve exhausted all my spirit force, I’m dead!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery continued to mutter, and his face was filled with despair. Zhao Jiuge had already encountered life or death situations before, so he was very calm. He squinted and seriously observed the yin energy. Then his eyes lit up and he said, “It’s the village temple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s face was ashen and filled with despair. He thought about this, but it was too late now. During the day, Zhao Jiuge had proposed to check out the village temple but had been rejected by him. He regretted it so much now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the yin energy surging toward them, Zhao Jiuge steadied his mind and calmly said, “Yu family, return to the house. Old Daoist, you go back as well and quickly recover your spirit force. I still have some spirit stone you can use. I’ll stay here and test what kind of thing the true culprit is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he threw dozens of spirit stones at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. These spirit stones were from Wang Baiwan. Thinking about Wang Baiwan, Zhao Jiuge’s expression became gloomy, but he didn’t have the time to think about it right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was shocked by the dozens of colorful spirit stones. He had saved for a long time only to gather a bit over 100 spirit stones, and he was reluctant to use them. He didn’t expect this boy to be so generous. Then he thought about Zhao Jiuge’s gourd, and the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s heart suddenly became heated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly urged his disciple to help him back into the house along with the rest of the Yu family. After all, his life was most important—once he recovered a little bit of spirit force, his chances of survival would increase greatly. However, the yin energy arrived in an instant and surrounded the Yu family’s ancestral home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahhhhhh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miserable scream echoed, followed by a muffled sound. The housekeeper, Yu Fu, fell to the ground and his body quickly dried up, leaving no trace of blood. His breath was gone and his eyes revealed a painful expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This method of death was exactly the same as how the other servants of the Yu family had died in the Yu ancestral temple. No wonder they could not find anything suspicious before. Zhao Jiuge took one look at Yu Fu and knew that all his essence blood had been drained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qingshan wasn’t able to feel sad or angry at the sudden change in the situation. He was awakened by the roar from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. He and his eldest son quickly pulled the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery back into the house along with the rest of the Yu family. This left Zhao Jiuge alone outside the house.</span></p>

He found the source of the spirit force fluctuations and saw the green-eyed black cat looking at him with an arrogant gaze.</span></p>
