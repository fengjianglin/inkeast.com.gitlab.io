 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge was strong, he was still a child. When he saw everyone come out, he endured the discomfort in his body and proudly said, “How about that? Aren’t I stronger than that old Daoist?” After he spoke, he looked at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery in the back with a face filled with pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xiasheng ran toward Zhao Jiuge like a swallow with her arms open. She gave Zhao Jiuge a big hug. Previously, her face was pale, but now it was red from excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Powerful, powerful—Little Brother is really powerful.” While Yu Xiasheng spoke she held Zhao Jiuge’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then she looked down at Zhao Jiuge and teasingly smiled. “Are you okay? It looks like your body’s spirit sword is not damaged.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unknown if it was due to his injuries or shyness, but Zhao Jiuge’s face turned red. Yu Xiasheng was a few years older and was a bit taller than him, so when she held him, his face was pressed against her chest. Zhao Jiuge felt the soft sensation and immediately broke free. He refused to accept defeat and said, “Hmph, whether it's damaged or not, you’ll know when you try it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, Yu Xiasheng didn’t make a sound, but she stuck her tongue out. She then pinched his face hard and then retreated back to her mother’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qingshan was like an old fox and was very happy. After seeing how powerful Zhao Jiuge was, he hoped his daughter could attract Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his sister taking the lead, Yu Qiusheng wasn’t willing to fall behind. He immediately pulled Zhao Jiuge and shouted, “Elder Immortal Zhao, accept me as your disciple. I want to learn your skills!” His eyes were filled with expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao jiuge felt dizzy from being pulled, and his aura became unstable. It took him a while to stabilize his injuries, then he helplessly said, “I only just joined the sect myself, how can I teach you? If you really have the heart, you can try your luck when the sect recruits again.” Yu Qingshan was a little disappointed after hearing this. However, when he heard that there was still a chance, his eyes lit up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qingshan naturally saw that Zhao Jiuge was completely exhausted, but he was afraid his youngest son would anger him. Therefore, he quickly pulled Yu Qiusheng aside and respectfully bowed toward Zhao Jiuge. “My entire Yu family will not dare to forget what Elder Immortal Zhao has done for my family. We’ll remember it forever!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Yu Qingshan seemed to remember something. He quickly turned and said the same thing to the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. Although the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery hadn’t done much in the end, Yu Qingshan wasn’t going to offend an immortal like the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery over such trivial matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery smiled faintly and then looked at Zhao Jiuge. His hand tightly grasped the Yin Spirit Bead and he said in a strange tone, “What do you mean? We have to thank Zhao Jiuge. If not for his mighty cultivation method and sword art, we might not have made it out alive today. Zhao Jiuge, Elder Immortal Zhao, is so strong. Isn’t that right, Elder Immortal Zhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the Lord of the Qing Feng Monaster speak in such an abnormal manner, along with how he was clenching the Yin Spirit Bead, Zhao Jiuge’s face froze for a moment. A terrible guess popped into Zhao Jiuge’s mind, but his expression immediately recovered. He modestly said, “Half the credit is yours. If you hadn’t dealt with the Green Haired Zombie, I wouldn’t have been able to kill the Three-Tailed Yin Cat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge finished speaking, he carefully observed the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. He then paused a bit and said, “That’s right, the Yin Spirit Bead is my spoil of war. You’ve been looking at it for a while, but you should return it to me now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery slowly shook his head. He had a smile as he said, “You said that half the credit is mine. Doesn’t that mean that half this Yin Spirit Bead is mine as well? Since Elder Immortal Zhao is so amazing this poor Daoist really admires you, I hope you can take out the cultivation method you used to deal with the Three-Tailed Yin Cat so this poor Daoist can study it as well. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Little Daoist Boy saw Zhao Jiuge get knocked into the ground by the Three-Tailed Yin Cat, he awakened the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. Although he had only recovered about 20% of his spirit force, he had to be ready in order to save his own life. Afterward, he just happened to see Zhao Jiuge use the two golden dragons. He instantly knew that this was no ordinary spell, and it made his eyes shine. However, since they were still facing a crisis, he didn’t think too much about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Zhao Jiuge accidently reached the Foundation Realm and killed the Three-Tailed Yin Cat. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery knew that the Yin Spirit Bead was a good material, so the greed in his heart surged. He also saw that Zhao Jiuge was like a dried-up oil lamp, causing his greed to amplify infinitely. Now not only did he want to take the Yin Spirit Bead, he even wanted Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s words, Zhao Jiuge’s heart sank. His initial guess was verified in the end. Generally speaking, asking about someone else’s cultivation method was a great taboo. During life or death battles, no one wanted others to know their cultivation method. Under normal circumstances, he would reject without hesitation, but Zhao Jiuge’s physical condition was terrible right now. Although he had reached the Foundation Realm, his spirit force hadn’t recovered, while the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had recovered a bit. It was enough to deal with the current Zhao Jiuge, so Zhao Jiuge had to think of how to respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this situation, even a fool would know that something was wrong. Yu Qingshan didn’t dare to make a move, he just quickly stood on the side with his family. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery wasn’t in a hurry. He looked at Zhao Jiuge’s indecisive expression and waited for an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, why are you wasting time with him? If he doesn’t give it, then just teach him a lesson. He can’t do anything now anyways, so let’s teach him a lesson and resolve the hatred from before!” After waiting in silence for a bit, the little Daoist boy could not wait any longer. His eyes were vicious as he still remembered the grudge from back at the village entrance. At this moment, he no longer had the fearful expression he had when facing the Three-Tailed Yin Cat. He was like a little villain who only bullied the weak and feared the strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Daoist boy hadn’t lowered his tone, so his voice echoed across the whole yard. Zhao Jiuge’s expression changed. His teacher was indeed correct. The human heart was more dangerous than anything else in the world. Although the little Daoist boy had only said to “teach him a lesson,” the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery might just kill him to steal his treasures. His body was weak, but an idea came to his mind. Zhao Jiuge smiled. “What the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery said is correct, a part of the Yin Spirit Bead belongs to you. However, a cultivation method is not easy to give, so how about we do this? The Yin Spirit Bead will be yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, how could half the Yin Spirit Bead belong to the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery? It should belong entirely to Zhao Jiuge. However, Zhao Jiuge was hoping to be able to retreat by giving up the Yin Spirit Bead. He could always get more treasures later, but he needed his life to enjoy it all. After he spoke, Zhao Jiuge looked at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery nervously, hoping he would be content. Sadly, he had underestimated how greedy people could become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery held the Yin Spirit Bead and laughed. “I’ll take the Yin Spirit Bead, but I really admire your cultivation method. I also remember you saying that you belong to some Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Hand over the cultivation method and the sword art; otherwise, you know the consequences.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery no longer pretended and revealed his ugly expression. Originally, he was still worried that Zhao Jiuge had some hidden ace, but upon seeing Zhao Jiuge give up the Yin Spirit Bead so easily, he became thoroughly unbridled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge heard this, he no longer pretended with the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. His face was now filled with anger. He had retreated many steps, but he didn’t expect the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery to not only want his cultivation method, but even the sect’s sword art. He shouted, “In your dreams, don’t even think about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s decisive response, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery didn’t respond, and his face became gloomy. Then he let out a snort and waved the whisk in his hand. The whisk flew out and tied the weakened Zhao Jiuge up. He then pulled Zhao Jiuge into the ground before him and ferociously said, “Speak! Will you hand it over?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge remained stubborn and disdainfully said, “Blinded by greed!”</span></p>

He turned to his master and said, “If he won’t give it, kill him.” His lovely face was filled with killing intent.</span></p>

After all, he still had some worries about killing someone to steal their treasures. He could kill demons like it was nothing, but killing a fellow cultivator was different. However, just as he was hesitating, Zhao Jiuge’s words completely enraged him. His eyes became fierce and his spirit force surged. Even if he can’t get the cultivation method, he could still get that gourd.</span></p>

However, they remained silent and didn’t do anything. A fight between immortals was not something mortals could get involved in. What Yu Qingshan worried the most was that once this matter was over, the Yu family would be dragged into it.</span></p>

His movements were slow, but when he saw Zhao Jiuge fearlessly stare back at him, he knew he could not change Zhao Jiuge’s mind. Therefore, he no longer held back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph.”</span></p>

The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery felt like he had fallen into an ice cave. He could no longer control his body. He wanted to move but couldn’t. His eyes were filled with fear and he looked into the air toward the source of the snort.</span></p>

Her face was cold and her hair was coiled up high, and she was wearing a red dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red flying sword was humming. Just looking at the quality of the flying, one could tell that it was not ordinary. However, this was not what made the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery panic. Her flying in the air like that meant that she was at least at the Spirit Core Realm, and given the pressure he felt, perhaps she had already formed her nascent soul.</span></p>
