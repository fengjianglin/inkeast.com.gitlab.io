 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

How could Zhao Jiuge have such an abnormal body that could even resist a spirit treasure? Although he couldn’t use the full power of a spirit treasure, the raw power of a spirit treasure could not be underestimated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the disciples from the other two peaks who saw this through the Mysterious Light Mirror were shocked. They cursed at the Mysterious Heaven Peak for creating such an abnormal person! What kind of spell was that!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t know that this was something Zhao Jiuge had learned when he was trying to condense the third golden dragon. Right now, he could only make his right arm this powerful. He secretly guessed that as his cultivation level increased, the rest of his body would continue to change. Eventually, his entire body would undergo a change, but this was all his own speculation. Today was the first time he had used the Sanskrit Divine Body like this, and it brought about such a great change. The amazing effect made Zhao Jiuge very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the boulder on top of the nameless mountain, Jian Wuxian’s eyes lit up and the corners of his mouth curved up to a playful smile. However, he suddenly felt someone approach, causing his relaxed body to suddenly stiffen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Buddhist spell. I never imagined one my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect disciples could have this kind of fate. From the looks of it, it’s very powerful, it’s just… I wonder what kind of spell this is.” A soft whisper came from a middle aged man wearing a yellow robe. This man’s skin was ruddy like a baby’s and his ethereal temperament was even stronger than Jian Wuxian’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other six people heard this man talk, they all trembled. Although they were shocked at how this training exercise had even caused someone like him to come out, the six of them bowed and respectfully said, “Greetings, Dawn Wind Elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had a lot of elders, and they normally wouldn't come out unless the sect encountered danger. Generally, those that became powerful enough to start ignoring mundane matters would become elders. The Dawn Wind Elder was undoubtedly at the top among the elders. Although Jian Wuxian was the Head Teacher, the peak combat power of the sect was controlled by the Dawn Wind Elder. However, normal matters were dealt with by Jian Wuxian. The elders existed to deter evil doers and small sects. After all, when there was something they couldn’t deal with, they had to rely on the elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dawn Wind Elder, aren’t you always in closed-door training? How come you found the time to come here today?” Jian Wuxian was very respectful toward the Dawn Wind Elder. This person was like the guiding light of the sect. If they were to lose their top combat forces, they could be eliminated by the other factions at any moment. However, with the passage of time, once their cultivation stopped progressing they would still die. This was why a sect needed to have excellent disciples, to inject fresh blood into the sect so the sect could stand forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dawn Wind Elder smiled faintly and casually said, “I made a breakthrough, so I came out. I have cultivated for many years, and after such a long time, it has become a little boring. I rarely come out, and since such an interesting event is taking place, I had to come and see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven of them didn’t dare to breathe too loudly. They respectfully stood there and listened to his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dawn Wind Elder seemed to remember something and thoughtfully said, “Once the inner sect selection is over, you all have to teach them well. The next time I come out, I’ll pick a few of the excellent disciples and teach them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words shocked the seven people here. They didn’t think the Dawn Wind Elder would personally teach and impart experience. Soon, their old faces were filled with joy. The later the stage one reached, the more precious experience was. That was why the disciples of the Holy Lands cultivated so quickly. Not only did they have abundant resources, more importantly, they had someone to teach them! If the master’s strength was only so-so, how could they teach any demonic talents?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian excitedly nodded and then the atmosphere calmed down once more. The Dawn Wind Elder didn’t speak again, so how would they dare to make a fuss?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking advantage of the break he had gained from sending Ling Longbiao flying with a punch, Zhao Jiuge quickly glanced at the other two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had the same idea as him, to quickly finish the battle. While the other side was still careless, she quickly dealt with a Foundation Realm disciple. Looking at the Mysterious Strange Peak disciple laying on the ground, he had to be suffering, as an angry Bai Qingqing would not hold back. However, Zhang Pingquan was not weak either—even when facing Bai Qingqing, she was not losing by much. Not to mention she still had two people helping her on the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Leng Rufeng, he was going one-on-two, so he was at a bit of a disadvantage, but it was still stable. The three of them had reached a stalemate. Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh of relief. The other side still had seven people, and he needed to quickly deal with Ling Longbiao and one other so he could be free to help them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle had just started, but Zhao Jiuge had already downed one person and knocked a second person away. This made Ling Longbiao completely remove all contempt he had for Zhao Jiuge. Being able to own a spirit treasure showed that his family background was not simple. He had learned about how powerful those heaven-defying spells could be from records in his family. Although Zhao Jiuge’s punch was shocking, it wasn’t enough to dispel his battle intent. The other disciple was already standing next to him, and right now was not the time to care about style or be embarrassed about ganging up on someone. After all, the result was what was most important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit lights flashed on the mountaintop and thunderous rumbles echoed from all the collisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force was being rapidly consumed as he was using the Sanskrit Divine Body at full force. He didn’t say a word and once more charged at the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao and the other youth looked at each other, then both their flying swords hummed. Both of them used the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art. Since they couldn’t injure Zhao Jiuge with the sharpness of their treasures, then they were going to try the sword art.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao took a profound look at Zhao Jiuge and then the sword energy flew out, creating a ravine on the ground. The sword energy from the youth beside him quickly followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out a snort and fearlessly galloped forward. He felt weird not having a sword in his hand and fighting using such a brutal and violent method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the two rays of sword energy hit Zhao Jiuge one after the other. The golden light around Zhao Jiuge dimmed and took a moment to recover. Zhao Jiuge stumbled a few steps to regain his footing. Although he wasn’t injured, 20% of his spirit force had been consumed! Spirit treasures were indeed powerful, and Ling Longbiao couldn’t even use the full power of his spirit treasure. If Ling Longbiao could use its full power, who knew what state Zhao Jiuge would be in right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing his attack having an effect, Ling Longbiao’s mouth curved up in a cruel smile. The golden sword in his hand shined and he was going to attack Zhao Jiuge again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Ling Longbiao’s action, Zhao Jiuge cursed in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think that just because you have a treasure, I don’t?”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge smirked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had less than 40% of his spirit force left, but it was enough. His Sanskrit Divine Body reached its peak once more and he rushed toward Ling Longbiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao’s eyes lit up and he secretly smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It's good that you came, I was afraid you would run. I don’t believe that turtle shell of yours can be used for ever. Let’s see how much spirit force you have!”</span></p>

This one was even more violent than before. Zhao Jiuge’s body trembled a bit before he steadied himself and threw something into the air. It was the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd.</span></p>

Then a shadow appeared and took the youth away. Zhao Jiuge saw that it was someone from the Enforcement Hall. They must have assumed that the attack was life-threatening, so they had intervened. However, this would not change the outcome of this battle, because that youth had already been eliminated.</span></p>
