 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about it? I didn’t lie to you two.” Han Songcheng felt a bit of anger in heart, and his gaze toward the Purple Ji Spirit Stone was filled with reluctance. However, he realized that compared to his life, none of this mattered. If you walk by the river too often, you will eventually get your shoes wet. This time, he hit an iron plate, so he had nothing to say. As long as he survived, it wouldn’t matter if he gave them all the Purple Ji Spirit Stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At least you know what’s good for you.” Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with passion. This was the first time he had seen a mine like this. Although he had seen records of various ores in the jade tubes, it was not as shocking as seeing them in a mine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but squat down and gently caress the bright purple crystals on the wall. He stared at the smooth and hard material and felt the warmth coming from his fingers. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge was immersed in his thoughts about the treasures and flying sword he was going to refine. A bright smile appeared unknowingly on his face. All his vigilance from before was gone and he even left his back exposed to Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s eyes shined while he stared at Zhao Jiuge. He was struggling in his heart, debating if he should take advantage of this situation and deal with Zhao Jiuge. After dealing with Zhao Jiuge, the only one left wouldn’t have much spirit force either, so it would be a winnable fight. Preserving his life was good, but if he could preserve his life, keep the mine, and even get some treasures from the two of them, it would be even better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was able to clearly see everything Han Songcheng was doing and thinking while he stared at Zhao Jiuge. She couldn’t help but sneer in her heart. Trash was indeed trash—wouldn’t even let go the smallest opportunity. Fortunately, she never intended to let him go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, Bai Qingqing decided not to delay it further. Now that they were at the mine, Han Songcheng had no value left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Han Songcheng, what are you looking at?” Bai Qingqing suddenly shouted. This caused Han Songcheng, who had ill intent, to jump and tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng nervously looked up at Bai Qingqing, who had a smile that wasn’t a smile on her face, and panicked. He pretended like nothing had happened and said, “It’s nothing. I’m just a bit reluctant to part with so much Purple Ji Spirit Stone, so I wanted to take one final look. Now that I’m done looking, I’ll take my leave. As for this small mine, do as you wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You want to leave? Do you think that's possible?” Bai Qingqing raised her eyebrows and the Wind Flower Sword in her hand shined. Hearing the two of them talk, Zhao Jiuge stood up and looked back at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng had already relaxed, but when he saw Bai Qingqing’s actions, he suddenly panicked again. His mouth opened wide in shock and he pointed at Bai Qingqing. “You… You… You're really going to kill me! But you swore by the Heavenly Dao Oath! Are you not afraid of being punished by the heavenly thunder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing smiled. She looked at Han Songcheng like she was looking at an idiot and said, “Earlier, only he swore, I did not. He can’t kill you, but that doesn’t mean I can’t kill you. A piece of trash like you would only hurt more innocent people, so just go die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was shocked, this was fine? No wonder when he was struggling to make the decision she pinched him. Back then Han Songcheng was worried about his life or death that he forgot that Bai Qingqing didn’t swear an oath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… This…” After Bai Qingqing finished speaking, Han Songcheng couldn’t even finish his sentence. There was a flash of sword light in this small space, but this time it wasn’t dazzling, because the glow from the Purple Ji Spirit Stone was even brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft thud echoed, and it was particularly ear-piercing. Han Songcheng had a shocked expression while his head rolled on the ground. This happened so suddenly that even Zhao Jiuge was startled. Seeing this devil scum die, Zhao Jiuge felt a burst of joy for the people of Yellow Flower Ridge, because they would no longer have to live in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing that Zhao Jiuge had no other emotions in his eyes, Bai Qingqing breathed a sigh of relief. She was afraid that Zhao Jiuge would find her methods disgusting. After letting out a sigh of relief, she was in the mood to joke with Zhao Jiuge. “Look, your sect contributions are at hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, she pointed at the head on the ground. She found the fact that Zhao Jiuge was such a miser really interesting, but most importantly, she felt the struggle of someone without any backing. After all, someone like her didn’t lack these items or resources. In general, she would give them to Zhao Jiuge, but she wouldn’t give him anything too precious to affect his growth. However, the situation now was different because these Purple Ji Spirit Stones were very important to her. This large amount would be very helpful to her and her father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, that’s right, this is all sect contributions. I’ll buy some materials and go forge a defensive treasure with these Purple Ji Spirit Stones.” Zhao Jiuge clutched these irregularly-shaped Purple Ji Spirit Stones and his face blushed from excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words immediately caused Bai Qingqing to close her mouth, and her expression became complicated. She looked at the smiling Zhao Jiuge and her expression became serious. In the end, she still opened her mouth. “Jiuge can I talk with you about something?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly stopped smiling and looked at Bai Qingqing with some doubt on his face. “What do you want to talk about? Just say it, is there anything we can’t talk about between the two of us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s like this, I have an urgent need for these Purple Ji Spirit Stones. I think…” Before Bai Qingqing could finish these embarrassing words, Zhao Jiuge quickly interrupted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know what you want to say. There are about 650 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stones here. You take 500 kilograms, leave the rest for me to refine some treasures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s expression immediately became a little anxious and she retorted, “How can we do that, Jiuge? You don’t know the value of this Purple Ji Spirit Stone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before she could finish speaking, Zhao Jiuge interrupted her again. “Even if this mine is worth a lot, how can it compare to our relationship? You don’t have to feel bad. Besides, you have helped me a lot.” Zhao Jiuge didn’t feel any reluctance in his heart at all, this was simply how he was. If others were good to him, he would remember it and repay them in folds. Similarly, if others wronged him, he would remember it and pay them back in folds as well. He drew a clear distinction between those who were good to him and those who weren’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his words were simple, Bai Qingqing felt warmth in her heart. If it wasn’t absolutely needed, she would not have opened her mouth. However, the situation in her family was too complicated, and in order to consolidate her father’s position, resources were very valuable. If it wasn’t for the fact that the situation at home wasn’t good, she would’ve considered taking Zhao Jiuge home with her. That way, he would not have to worry about cultivation resources anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing felt moved and no longer refused. She silently put 500 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone into her storage ring. Then she quickly changed the topic and deliberately quipped with Zhao Jiuge. She rolled her eyes. “What do you mean by ‘our relationship?’ Why couldn’t you just say ‘our friendship?’ Others who hear it might think there is something between us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I wish there was something between us. I wouldn’t suffer if I were lumped together with such a beautiful girl. I’d be the one who would benefit.” Zhao Jiuge revealed the look of a rascal and glanced at Bai Qingqing’s beautiful body. She avoided his gaze. Then Bai Qingqing, who was filled with thoughts, became silent. She didn’t have the heart to pay attention to Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was left with the remaining 150 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone. He touched them, looked at them, and then finally put them into his own storage ring with a happy smile. These were important materials for refining treasures. For a poor person like Zhao Jiuge, this was like someone delivering him a pillow the moment he became sleepy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two stayed in the mine for a long time before coming out. Bai Qingqing had used the effect of the pill to recover spirit force. Now that Han Songcheng had been dealt with, they were going to return to the sect, but before that, they were going to take a trip to Iron Mouth Village. While Bai Qingqing was cultivating to recover, Zhao Jiuge slowly collected the Purple Ji Spirit Stones, he wasn’t even willing to let any residue go. Even after cleaning out the place, he still looked around for other ores. Bai Qingqing noticed Zhao Jiuge’s actions and smiled.</span></p>

He calmed himself and began to cultivate. The surroundings became peaceful once more.</span></p>

Zhao Jiuge could not hide the big smile on his face.</span></p>

As for the other things, they weren’t worthy of Zhao Jiuge’s attention, so he was too lazy to take them.</span></p>

Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing flew into the sky, leaving trails of colorful lights. On his flying sword, Zhao Jiuge was immersed in excitement and constantly giggled with a silly smile on his face. Bai Qingqing coldly looked into the distance while holding a cloth bag with something inside. Her cold gaze would occasionally turn to Zhao Jiuge’s silly smile and a hint of joy would arise in her eyes. As the person who had obtained 500 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone, she was the one who had gotten the most out of this trip.</span></p>

Accounting for Zhang Long and Luo Xuqing’s group, there were more than 30 weapons that were collected, along with Han Songcheng and Vulture’s flying swords. The most important harvest was the Twilight Drum and the nearly 150 kilograms of Purple Jio Spirit Stone.</span></p>

As for the illusion formation, he would need to buy the spells for it at the Treasure Pavilion. This was a good item, and an external item could also help enhance his strength.</span></p>

The two of them left Fallen Leaf Mountain with a bountiful harvest. If not for the marks and blood left after the fierce battle, it was as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
