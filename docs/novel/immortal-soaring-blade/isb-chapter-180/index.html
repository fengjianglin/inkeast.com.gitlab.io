 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that they had the advantage, if they still didn’t do anything, people would say that Zhang Pingquan was useless. Following Zhang Pingquan’s cold words, the remaining eight all clenched their flying swords. They slowly walked into a formation and faced off against Zhao Jiuge’s group of three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere on top of Wu Hua Peak became oppressive. A great battle was about to erupt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhang Pingquan’s spirit force erupted, her dark skin seemed a bit whiter from the spirit light shining on her. Behind her, eight rays of spirit light appeared. The pressure made Zhao Jiuge feel his chest become a bit stuffy. He didn’t have it too bad; however, Leng Rufeng’s body trembled a little. After all, he hadn’t tempered his body inside a spirit vein yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with battle intent. He wasn’t just speaking nonsense, he really was fearless! Although the other side had nine people, he found out through their spirit force that only Zhang Pingquan and Ling Longbiao had tempered their bodies. A powerful and mysterious Bai Qingqing, along with his Sanskrit Divine Body, made him confident they could battle against the nine of them. What’s more, even though Leng Rufeng was only at the early stage of the Foundation Realm, he was not weak. They were the same type of people, so he knew exactly how hardworking and determined Leng Rufeng was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me deal with Zhang Pingquan and the other three. Jiuge, you deal with Ling Longbiao and two more. The remaining two early stage the Foundation Realm cultivators will be left for Leng Rufeng. Remember, if you can deal with it quickly, then don’t worry about spirit force consumption and deal with them. If you can’t, then just hold them back, I’ll quickly finish this and help you. Don’t forget, we still have a group of Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples watching us. Both of you, be careful, I don’t have any spare power to help you two.” Bai Qingqing’s words were hasty. She was very angry right now. She originally thought victory was at hand, but she didn’t expect Mu Zijun’s group to not appear at all. The two peaks had almost joined forces to suppress their Mysterious Heaven Peak. Then she immediately charged toward the four people she had selected and her spirit force erupted in full. She was going to quickly finish this battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge laughed loudly and said only two words to Leng Rufeng. “Be careful!” After that, he no longer wasted time speaking nonsense. If he wasn’t happy, he would fight. He didn’t like wasting time talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng nodded, and his eyes were filled with determination. No matter what, he didn’t want to drag Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing down. The two most difficult people to deal with were already being stopped by the two of them, and Bai Qingqing was taking on four people. He had to deal with the least amount of people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Zhao Jiuge charged forward, a flash of golden light surrounded his body. He immediately used the Sanskrit Divine Body, causing a layer of golden light to surround his body. The phantom of the laughing Buddha shrouded Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t intend to hold back, so he directly used his ace, the Sanskrit Divine Body. The longer this fight went on, the more disadvantageous it would be for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s laughter echoed. He charged toward Ling Longbiao and the two people next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao and the two people next to him were all at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. Would three mid stage Foundation Realm cultivators be afraid of one mid stage Foundation Realm cultivator? The answer was an obvious no! They looked at Zhao Jiuge with disdain and raised their flying sword. All three of them began using the sword art, and three rays of silver sword energy gathered at the tips of their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the first layer of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art wasn’t that powerful, it didn't mean that the later layers would not be powerful and overbearing. No one would give up on using the sword art to learn something else, as it would not be good for the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge ignored the rays of sword energy and charged forward like he wasn’t seeing them at all. However, his grip on his sword became tighter and his sword shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao had a proud expression. His family background was not bad, but Zhang Pingquan’s strength was truly outstanding. He really admired her and was willing to listen to Zhang Pingquan’s orders. However, that didn’t mean that he himself was lacking. He looked down on Zhao Jiuge from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples was already unhappy with Zhao Jiuge pretending to be cool, so he moved like the wind. He charged out a few steps ahead of the other two and waved the sword in his hand. A ray of silver sword energy flew out toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light around Zhao Jiuge shined brightly. When he saw the actions of that disciple from the Mysterious Strange Peak, not only did he not avoid or resist, he accelerated toward that disciple. He only slightly raised the Blue Plum Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous rumble echoed and the ray of silver sword energy directly hit Zhao Jiuge’s body. However, this hasty attack wasn’t able to do any damage to Zhao Jiuge, who cultivated the Sanskrit Divine Body—it wasn’t even able to slow him down one bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, there was a flash of cold intent in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes. He raised the Blue Plum Sword into the air and silver light gathered at its tip. Then he chopped down at the shoulder of this Mysterious Strange Peak disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword energy cut across the youth’s green robe and into his flesh. Zhao Jiuge’s attack directly broke the spirit force protecting his body, and a deep wound appeared diagonally across his chest. It was so deep that even his bones could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was sent flying by the power of the blow. If he hadn’t collided with Ling Longbiao on the way, he would have been sent flying even further. He fell to the ground and his face was twisted from the pain. He let out a low moan in pain and the spirit light around his body disappeared. His meridians were injured, so his cultivation method could no longer remain active and the spirit force around him dissipated. Just one blow from Zhao Jiuge had managed to injure a Mysterious Strange Peak disciple who was at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm to the point where he could no longer fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Mysterious Heaven Peak Square, everyone was staring at the scene inside the mirror. When Zhao Jiuge defeated an enemy in one blow, the entire square went into an uproar. They were so excited that they felt like they were the people on Wu Hua Peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…!” Ling Longbiao was anxious and angry. He frowned and stared at Zhao Jiuge in anger. The fight had just started, yet Zhao Jiuge had already knocked one person out. Originally, he held the mentality of a cat playing with a mouse, but now all of that disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden sword in his hand suddenly lit up. The sword was slender and the tip was a cone; it didn’t look like a sword at all. The most eye-catching part was that the sword gave off a foggy light that surrounded it. Even before Ling Longbiao released his spirit force, the sharpness the sword exuded made Zhao Jiuge feel a sense of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao was actually holding a spirit treasure-grade flying sword—Zhao Jiuge had only felt that from Bai Qingqing’s Wind Flower Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s pupils shrank and his expression became serious, but he showed no sign of retreating—he adjusted himself and continued charging forward. When Ling Longbiao’s aura changed and he moved toward Zhao Jiuge, there was a flash of light in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes. He didn’t hesitate to meet Ling Longbiao head-on. He didn’t have a habit of avoiding battles, and since this was unavoidable, he was going all out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao didn’t use any fancy tricks or had any time to use spells. He decided to go for a direct confrontation by taking advantage of the sharpness of the spirit treasure-grade flying sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao raised the sword in his hand like he had full control of the situation and stabbed toward Zhao Jiuge. The surrounding air seemed to be sliced apart by the sword, and a rumble clearly entered Zhao Jiuge’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge could only raise the Blue Plum Sword in his hand and inject spirit force inside it. He was going to rely on his Sanskrit Divine Body to resist the attack from Ling Longbiao. However, there were hidden flashes of light in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes, hiding his true intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two sides collided, there was no thunderous rumble, but the Blue Plum Sword in his hand was broken in half. It no longer shined and fell quietly on the ground. After taking Ling Longbaio’s sharp blow, Zhao Jiuge was not injured, but his spirit force was depleting rapidly and his flying sword was now useless. Zhao Jiuge felt anger. Although the Blue Plum Sword was not a good quality flying sword, it had been with him for a long time; he felt emotionally attached to it after surviving so many dangerous situations with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt like his chest was about to erupt and his expression changed a few times. He clenched his teeth and shouted, “You’ve gone too far!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbaio only revealed a smile of disdain and a look of contempt. He continued to brandish the spirit treasure in his hand and attacked Zhao Jiuge. It looked like he wanted to break Zhao Jiuge like the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge snorted in his heart and there was a flash of golden light in his eyes. After losing the Blue Plum Sword, his hands quickly formed seals. The spirit force in the air gathered around Zhao Jiuge and soon formed a layer of intense, golden light. It was as if he had put on golden clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, everyone saw Zhao Jiuge charge at Ling Longbiao’s spirit treasure with his bare hands like he had gone crazy. Everyone was stunned. What was he going to do? Even Ling Longbiao was stunned for a moment. However, he was not going ot hesitate just because Zhao Jiuge had gone dumb. He continued his offensive and chopped down at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a dazzling light as bright as the sun shined from Zhao Jiuge’s arms. Some people felt like it was a bit blinding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the people on the square widened as they watched Zhao Jiuge, who looked like he didn’t care about his own life anymore. Then they saw the five fingers covered in bright, golden light face off against the flying sword. The powerful flying sword stopped moving—it was being held tightly in Zhao Jiuge’s right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was completely stunned. A mid stage Foundation Realm cultivator’s body had stopped the attack of a spirit treasure-grade flying sword. However, everyone found that this wasn’t the end. After stopping the spirit treasure, Zhao Jiuge formed a fist and fiercely punched the golden sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Longbiao couldn’t react in time and was sent flying along with this sword. Time seemed to stop at this moment, and the light brought by the fist was still lingering in the air. This scene was simply too barbaric—bare-handed against spirit treasure!</span></p>
