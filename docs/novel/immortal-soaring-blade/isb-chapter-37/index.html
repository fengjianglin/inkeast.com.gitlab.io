 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking out the Nine Sons Mother Banner, the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder revealed a cruel smile and his eyes filled with bloodthirst.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All magic treasures in the world were divided into good and evil. The Nine Sons Mother Banner was not only an evil treasure, but the method to create it was extremely cruel and bloody. One must suck all the essence blood from a pregnant woman and then extract her soul to refine her for months. Not only that, but the baby must be kept alive during the process, so the chance of success was only one in ten.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the first step was successful, the pregnant woman would be refined for a few months until the blood and the baby were connected. At that point, one would cut open the stomach, killing the baby and extracting the soul to coerce and control the woman. She would then go out killing children and taking their souls to be refined into the treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the problem of matching, the failure rate of this step was very high. One had to find eight children with matching souls to complete the Nine Sons Mother Banner. How many children were killed in order to find those eight souls?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s chest heaved up and down as she thought about those children that had died to the old man, and her mind was muddled with anger. Zhao Jiuge’s expression wasn’t much better than Su Su’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the creepy and gloomy nine different-looking children, there were many emotions in their hearts. The old man’s hand formed a seal and the female head opened her mouth and rushed toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Li Fire was urged by Zhao Jiuge and rushed into the sky. It immediately condensed into a fire snake and was about to devour the female head flying toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder saw Zhao Jiuge’s actions, he let out a cold snort. His right hand stretched up to the sky and blood-colored light suddenly gathered. There was a violent fluctuation of blood-red spirit force and then, with a wave of his hand, it shot toward the fire snake made of Li Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blood-red palm several meters large made of spirit force smashed down toward the fire snake. The palm caught the fire snake and squeezed. The fire snake struggled like crazy but could not break free. Zhao Jiuge focused his mind on the Li Fire Flag to manipulate the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how could his spirit force be compared with that of the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, who was in the Foundation Realm? The fire snake made of Li Fire became smaller and smaller, but the blood-colored palm was still filled with power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this happened in a moment. In a flash, the female head arrived before Zhao Jiuge. Su Su, who was standing behind Zhao Jiuge and had been itching for action, finally moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A milky-white light suddenly shined, rich and bright like a proud moon. The soft moonlight caused the gloomy atmosphere to dissipate a bit. With a wave of her hand, a sword appeared and smashed into the female head, knocking it back a few dozen meters. The female head let out a scream due to the pain, and her face became even more terrifying as she charged forward once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood-colored palm crushed the fire snake formed by the Li Fire Flag and dissipated completely. Zhao Jiuge could not help but feel helpless as his two biggest aces had been destroyed so easily. When he saw Su Su act with much more powerful spirit force than him, he relaxed a bit. He could only gather his own spirit force to deal with the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The brilliant, milky-white spirit light repelled the female head and was knocked back once more but was not hurt. This time, Zhao Jiuge followed up with his own sword light, and they attacked the Nine Sons Mother Banner together. The old man did not feel pressured when he saw this, but he was becoming irritated, no longer wanting to probe around against two juniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then his skinny right hand took out another treasure, the Black Dragon Whip he had bought from the auction. A rope-like magic treasure! Zhao Jiuge looked at it with envy, and even a bit of greed appeared in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He threw the Black Dragon Whip into the air and his hands began to form seals to control the banner. The Black Dragon Whip moved like a snake and shot toward Zhao Jiuge. Su Su wanted to help but was helpless because at this moment, the female head and even the nine children all rushed at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had no time to be distracted, so she flew into the air with one step. She stared at the female head and the nine children, and the spirit light around her became brighter. A pressure no weaker than that of the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder appeared. At this moment, the old man was surprised and began to seriously observe this young girl before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had always known that she was not simple—it was obvious from her temperament and the things she had. However, he hadn’t expected the gap to be so large when their ages were so similar. She was already at the Foundation Realm! He still hadn’t recovered from the shock when he felt something wrap around him. The Black Dragon Whip had him wrapped up tight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were wide open and he tried to use his spirit force to break free, but he found that whenever his spirit force touched the Black Dragon Whip, it would squeeze tighter. He could only lie there quietly without resisting and watch the two people fight in the sky. He couldn’t help but feel the bitterness due to the gap in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten continuous rays of milky-white sword light flew out and hit the head of the female and the nine children. An attack with this much precision not only required a powerful cultivation and control of externalizing spirit force, but most importantly, talent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female head flew back even more but still didn’t suffer any serious injuries. It was the nine children who began to cry in pain, making the atmosphere a bit strange. Su Su’s temper flared up, and when she saw that the attack had no effect, she reached for her hairpin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the old man didn’t give her the chance—the blood-red spirit light around his body expanded and formed two giant palms of spirit force shot toward her. She gave up reaching for the hairpin and copied the old man. She used her spirit force to form two milky-white palms as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom, boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two loud explosions echoed and all four palms disappeared—they were equal in power! After the four palms disappeared, the souls inside the Nine Sons Mother Banner rushed forward like puppets that were not afraid of being attacked. For the first time, shocking killing intent appeared on Su Su’s beautiful face. For the tragic death of these children and for the monstrous actions of this old man, Su Su took out the purple hairpin in her hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her long, black hair scattered across her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a hint of intoxication and gentleness appeared in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes as he watched the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple jade hairpin was the size of her palm, and it started to shine. It looked so extraordinary and noble in Su Su’s hand. She gently waved her right hand toward Zhao Jiuge and a ray of purple light flew across the Black Dragon Whip around Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crackle...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soft, crisp sound echoed and the tough Black Dragon Whip was easily broken. Zhao Jiuge simply felt envy and pity for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You old, undying thing, I’m going to do heaven’s work and kill you today,” she said through clenched teeth as her chest heaved up and down in rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, just a little girl like you wants to kill me? I have done many terrible things and still lived for this long. I didn’t expect someone as young as you to have cultivation comparable to this old man’s, and you have a lot of treasures too. Today, I’ll first suck your essence blood dry, then I’ll extract your soul to make it my treasure spirit.” The old man laughed loudly and didn’t hide the fact that he had done terrible things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su had been held to high standards by everyone in her family. When had she heard anyone say that they were going to suck her essence blood dry and extract her soul? At this moment, the fire of rage burned brightly in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not wasting any time, she continued to wave the purple hairpin in her hand and her long, black dress fluttered. Below, Zhao Jiuge was prepared to watch a good show. He hadn’t expected Su Su to have another side of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple light charged toward the Nine Sons Mother Banner with a terrifying aura. The blackish grey banner still floated there. The old man didn’t think Su Su would avoid the souls and go directly for the main body of the banner. He was caught off guard and panicked as he released spirit force to block the purple light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the purple light was too fast, so it flew by in the blink of an eye. The old man could only watch the purple light attack the main body of the Nine Sons Mother Banner. The purple light surrounded the banner, then the sound of something being ripped apart echoed. The originally blackish-grey banner fell to the ground and was now torn to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp shrill came from the female head, then the nine children followed and screamed as well. The grey smoke around them dimmed, and the two smaller children couldn’t withstand the blow and dissipated. Due to a lack of spirit force to support them, the female head and the remaining seven children rushed back into what remained of the Nine Sons Mother Banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Listen, no matter what force is behind you, whatever family or sect you’re from, today I’ll suck away all your essence blood and extract you to make up for the loss of my Nine Sons Mother Banner!” Even though the old man was a fool, he understood that for this young girl to have cultivation no weaker than his and so many extraordinary treasures, she had to have a powerful background. However, the destruction of his beloved Nine Sons Mother Banner had infuriated him to the point of losing his senses, and his eyes were red like a madman’s.</span></p>
