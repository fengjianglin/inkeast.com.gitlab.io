 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

The Yu family only felt an earthquake-like rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Three-tailed Yin Cat felt Zhao Jiuge’s sword intent, the pain from its skin made its expression sink. The Blue Plum Sword had collided with its claws, now Zhao Jiuge and the Three-tailed Yin Cat were only one meter apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each surged their spirit force like crazy, and they were trapped in a deadlock. Zhao Jiuge felt his spirit force being consumed rapidly. If this continued, all his spirit force would be used up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the Three-tailed Yin Cat suddenly rushed forward. In addition to blocking the Blue Plum Sword with its claws, it went from being one meter apart to less than ⅓ of a meter apart. Its expression became fierce and it let out a cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was startled when the cat suddenly closed in on him. Then the following cry made him lose focus for a moment. At this moment, he clearly saw a hint of sinister intent in the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next instant, the Three-tailed Yin Cat took advantage of this moment and the spirit force in its body surged. Originally, it was in a deadlock against the sword, but now it suddenly knocked the sword away. Zhao Jiuge panicked and quickly attacked with the sword once more. However, the Three-tailed Yin Cat ignored it and its claws lunged into Zhao Jiuge’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blue Plum Sword was longer than the cat’s paws, so it hit the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s body first. However, because this strike was hastily made, it bounced off the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s body. Before Zhao Jiuge could lament about how powerful the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s body was, its claws smashed into his chest and he felt his chest tighten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Zhao Jiuge felt the sky flip and heard the sound of wind. He was sent flying more than 20 meters into the ground. His head was dizzy and his internal aura was a mess. It took a while for Zhao Jiuge to get a hold of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing what was happening in the yard, the Yu family were all stunned. The battle against the Green Haired Zombie and the Three-tailed Yin Cat had undergone too many twists and turns. As Zhao Jiuge lay on the ground, the golden light around his body dimmed before disappearing. Due to the Sanskrit Divine Body, his body was not injured. However, the impact had caused his internal aura to become chaotic, and now blood was leaking from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dad, with Elder Immortal Zhao like this, will the demonic cat let us go?” Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s sorry state, even the calm Yu Chunsheng &nbsp;panicked. His words trembled with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is there to be scared of? If we really get to that point, then we are doomed either way. Even if we die, at least we are together and can accompany each other.” At first, Yu Qingshan yelled at his eldest son. Then he let out a sigh and hugged his wife and children.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Madam Yu was also filled with fear, she smiled when she heard her husband’s words. With her man here, along with her children, what was there to be afraid of?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qiusheng’s face was tense and without any trace of fear. He was focused on the scene outside. His fists were clenched when he saw Zhao Jiuge sent flying into the ground. He was completely immersed in the fight outside. Although he was the youngest, he was also the least afraid of dying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xiasheng’s face contained a faint hint of sadness. Her hands tightly grasped her mother’s hand and she remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The servants behind them chattered nonstop. They were all crying and regretting coming here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had his eyes closed and was completely ignoring the situation outside. He was focused on recovering his spirit force. The little daoist boy anxiously looked at the situation outside and then looked at his master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge coughed a few times, then he recovered and slowly got up. He used the Blue Plum Sword to help himself stand up. On the other side, the Three-tailed Yin Cat was quietly watching him. It was like a cat playing with a mouse. Zhao Jiuge let out a breath and began checking his condition. There were no major problems, and he had about 20% to 30% of his spirit force left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gently wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. Zhao Jiuge didn’t think the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s physical body would be so strong. Not only was its defense powerful, its claws were also sharp. No wonder the records said that although these yin objects and spirit beasts cultivated slowly, they were very strong. He was experiencing how powerful their physical bodies were first hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt isolated and useless against the powerful Three-tailed Yin Cat. He looked back at the house where everyone was hiding and then looked back at the cat. He seemed to make a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the corner of his mouth curled up and he began to laugh. There was still blood on the corner of his mouth. This laugh was somewhat decisive, somewhat helpless, but mostly a laugh of “I’ll hold my sword and laugh at the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sword cultivator had to possess a fearless spirit like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge laughed and said, “Take my last hit. If you can withstand it, I will admit defeat.” Then he ignored the Three-tailed Yin Cat and his hand began to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only had 20% or 30% of his spirit force left, which wasn’t much. This time, he was facing a life or death crisis more dangerous than anything he ever faced before. Aside from his two golden dragons, he had nothing left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hands moved in a set movement and then the two golden dragons in his dantian opened their eyes. The seals Zhao Jiuge had formed caused the two dragons to awaken from their slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat was originally just here for fun to see what this young man could do. However, a moment later, it felt a sense of danger in its heart. It saw Zhao Jiuge’s peaceful expression and how his body was dyed with golden light once more. The Three-tailed Yin Cat decided it could not wait anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was too late! Two dragon roars echoed through the night sky and two lifelike golden dragons appeared in the air, shining brightly. Strangely, when the two golden dragons appeared, the surrounding yin energy weakened a lot. Even the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s powerful aura weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the two lifelike golden dragons appear in the sky, the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s pupils shrank and the danger it felt became even stronger! It turned out to be a buddhist spell, which was good at restraining the cat! The Three-tailed Yin Cat no longer hesitated—it raised its front legs and stood up like a person. The yin energy that had just dissipated returned and was even stronger than before. The spirit force fluctuations from the Three-tailed Yin Cat reached the Foundation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder the Three-tailed Yin Cat had been so relaxed and looked like it had the situation under control—it had been hiding its strength the whole time! Zhao Jiuge revealed a bitter expression, but it was too late to regret now. He had already made his move, so he might as well go all out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Three-tailed Yin Cat released its full Foundation Realm cultivation, it finally relaxed a bit. Then its expression became vicious once more. Fierce spirit force surged out, and the dark green spirit force shined brightly, creating gusts of wind! The surrounding trees and plants all began to sway from the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t give the Three-tailed Yin Cat time to build up its power. He controlled the golden dragons to attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two golden dragons coiled together and flew in a parabola. Dragon roars echoed while the two golden dragons pounced at the Three-tailed Yin Cat.</span></p>

Then it revealed a fierce expression and a powerful light surrounded it. Endless spirit force erupted to resist the two golden dragons.</span></p>

It was at the early stage of the Foundation Realm, but its spirit force was being destroyed by the golden dragons from Zhao Jiuge, who was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm. The dark green spirit force was pierced through by the golden dragons. The Three-tailed Yin Cat found that it was useless to try to stop the golden dragons. The golden dragons seemed to be the bane of its spirit force, and it would disappear the moment it touched them.</span></p>

When it saw that its spirit force was useless, it reacted quickly. It quickly withdrew the spirit force and placed it around its body to buy more time. However, it was too late! The two golden dragons closed in and didn’t give the Three-tailed Yin Cat any time to react. It could only violently release its spirit force and try to withstand the attack using its powerful physical body.</span></p>

Although the two golden dragons were weakened by its spirit force, they still managed to hit the Three-tailed Yin Cat’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-tailed Yin Cat was sent flying back and was covered in blood. Its skin peeled back and it's aura had weakened a lot. Even the yin aura around it had dissipated completely. The Sanskrit Divine Body was a buddhist technique, which was a good counter to the yin attribute. This was why it could do so much damage to the Three-tailed Yin Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the Three-tailed Yin Cat finally injured, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with joy. This attack had used about 10% of his spirit force. Zhao Jiuge calculated that with his remaining 20%, he could still attack two more times. Given the current situation, it should be enough to deal with this Three-tailed Yin Cat. The two golden dragons had dimmed a lot after the attack, but they had coiled back already and were staring at the Three-tailed Yin Cat. They were ready to launch another attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge only got to be happy for a moment before the situation changed! The Three-tailed Yin Cat got up and shook its body, shaking the blood away. Then it snorted and looked at Zhao Jiuge with a strange smile. Zhao Jiue felt depressed and wondered what was going on when the Three-tailed Yin Cat raised its head. It opened its mouth and spat out a rice grain-sized, greyish-white bead. It was surrounded by dark green spirit force and floated before the Three-tailed Yin Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Three-tailed Yin Cat spat out the rice grain-sized, grayish-white bead, it looked at Zhao Jiuge with pride. Then killing intent filled its eyes.</span></p>

That was actually a Yin Spirit Bead!</span></p>
