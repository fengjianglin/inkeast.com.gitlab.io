 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t chase, we’ll chase once we are ready. Anyways, I know where they are going, they can’t run away. In the fight just now, we acted first and had the advantage, but that doesn’t mean they are easy to deal with. In a real face-to-face fight, they aren’t afraid of us.” Seeing Zhao Jiuge wanting to chase, Bai Qingqing quickly stopped him. After all, the situation just now showed that the other side had some skills. In particular, that last move with the treasure was too shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, Zhao Jiuge felt slightly unconvinced and pouted, but he stopped. Zhao Jiuge had felt pleasure from that battle just now, and he was very satisfied with the attribute he had gotten from the spirit vein. He wanted to continue the battle and go all out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because she saw through Zhao Jiuge’s thought, she calmly said, “There will be a chance later. A battle of life or death is no joke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge nodded, but he still asked, “What was that little drum-like treasure? It made us lose focus and allowed that old fellow to escape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing pondered for a bit before shaking her head. She had a trace of doubt on her face. “I don’t know either. Perhaps it's some kind of mental interference treasure. There are many kinds of treasures, so it's normal to not know what some of them do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing gently touched the Wind Flower Sword and continued, “Be a bit more careful next time. The more powerful a treasure, the greater the consumption and the harsher the conditions to use it. From the looks of that old man, we shouldn’t have to worry about it anymore. However, they likely still have help. This mission doesn’t seem as simple as it looks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, Zhao Jiuge’s brows furrowed even more. Things had changed again. This Han Songcheng had become more and more bold, but how come there was no intelligence about the rest of the people under him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Zhao Jiuge didn’t know was that Han Songcheng first killed and robbed as he wished before he slowly gathered a group of rogue cultivators under him. He relied on his cultivation and called himself the Yellow Flower Mountain Lord. He had gathered a group of like-minded people. Not only had he gathered rogue cultivators, he had even taken mortals that were willing to follow him and pass on basic cultivation methods. Slowly, his power had grown and he began to do more evil things. He occupied the whole Yellow Flower Ridge and ruled as king.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were talking, a rush of footsteps appeared behind them. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing turned around to see the old village chief rush over with the help of Cai Nu, with the rest of the villagers following them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old village chief’s wrinkled, old face was filled with excitement. The shocking scenes before them were short, but the villagers would never forget what they had seen. Although they didn’t understand what had happened, they still knew that Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing held the upper hand. This made them excited because they saw hope. They finally believed that these two youths had the power to save them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It has to be said that although everyone in Iron Mouth Village was prepared to die, they were still filled with fear. If these two could solve the issue, then not only their Iron Mouth Village, but all the surrounding villages in Yellow Flower Ridge would be saved as well. How many families would not be broken, how many wives wouldn’t become widows? In the eyes of cultivators, their lives might be like ants, but to them, the lives of their loved ones were more important than their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Happiness often came from being together with the person you’re closest to. This had nothing to do with wealth or status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, with the old village chief taking the lead, the hundreds of villagers—men, women, and children, young and old—all knelt down. They all stared at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing with gazes of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two fellow heroes, please save our Iron Mouth Village. Save all the wronged villagers in Yellow Flower Ridge.” After seeing the fight just now, the old village chief was completely convinced. He shouted tearfully at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qinging. His wrinkled old face was filled with helplessness and sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Village Chief, what are you doing? This is what we should do.” Zhao Jiuge was shocked by this. He quickly helped the old village chief up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing looked at the action of the villagers and her brows furrowed. She felt helpless. “All of you, get up, we are going to hunt Han Songcheng down.” Perhaps because she couldn’t stand the atmosphere, Bai Qingqing spoke quickly and used it as an excuse to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, Er Huzi quickly stood up and shouted, “I’ll go as well, I can help!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he spoke, before Bai Qingqing could refuse, Big Bear frowned. He quickly pulled Er Huzi’s clothes and muttered something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, Er Huzi’s face became stiff and he realized something. This was not an ordinary hunt in the mountains. With his brute force and muscles, he couldn’t do anything against those immortal spells. He wouldn’t be able to help at all. He let out an embarrassed smile and scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge looked at those children’s eyes, his heart became even more heavy. In the past, he was like them as well, growing up under the care of that old man. However, now everything had changed—he was no longer the same as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at these villagers, Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what to do. Perhaps the best thing he could do was get rid of Han Songcheng so they could go back to their carefree lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you go back, we are leaving. If we don’t chase them now, we will lose them.” The short exchange had delayed them a lot. Zhao Jiuge grew up in a mountain village just like this, so he knew how they felt and also felt their sincerity, unlike Bai Qingqing, who grew up feeling indifferent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking back at the villagers of Iron Mouth Village, Zhao Jiuge took out his Blue Plum Sword. He stepped onto the sword and flew after Bai Qingqing, who was flying toward where Han Songcheng and Vulture had escaped to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two rays of sword light disappeared, the villagers were still reluctant to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two flying swords rushed through the mountain. Feeling the breeze flowing on their faces, the depressed mood from before had disappeared. Bai Qingqing’s face was as calm as water once more. Zhao Jiuge glanced at Bai Qingqing. He didn’t take issue with Bai Qingqing’s attitude toward the villagers. After all, everyone had grown up in a different environment. What’s more, he knew that although she acted cold, she had a warm heart. Her mouth was as sharp as a knife, but her heart was as soft as tofu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them flew side by side as fast as possible, not worrying about how much spirit force they were consuming. Both of them were at peak condition, while Han Songcheng only had half his spirit force and Vulture was out of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing calmly said to Zhao Jiuge, “When we meet Han Songcheng again, don't act recklessly. Wait for my signal to act. These people are most treacherous and will kill without hesitation. This is not like a spar in the sect, life or death is decided in the blink of an eye.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know, you have said it a few times already.” Zhao Jiuge helplessly promised, but he knew that Bai Qingqing was looking out for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He secretly glanced at Bai Qingqing. Almost two years of time had made Bai Qingqing more stable and mature. She was now almost 20 years old and was a bit taller than him. She had already become a trustworthy old friend in his heart. He had also been in the sect for almost two years. From a 15-year-old youth who didn’t know anything to a 17-year-old young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because Zhao Jiuge had a careless attitude, Bai Qingqing still felt a little uneasy. After pondering a bit, Bai Qingqing took something out of her ring and threw it at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge subconsciously reached out and caught it. He looked at it and saw a blue, palm-sized porcelain jade bottle. Touching it, he could feel a burst of heart-piercing chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was somewhat surprised and asked, “What is this thing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Little Huan Pill, it's made from some spirit herbs and is used to recover spirit force. If something unexpected happens and you get injured or are lacking spirit force, swallow it.” Bai Qingqing looked sharply into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge opened the little bottle and he curiously looked inside. There were seven or eight dark red pills quietly lying in the jade bottle. They gave off an unspeakable smell, and each of them was only the size of his pinky nail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what spirit herbs they were made from, he carefully put the bottle near his chest. After all, if he needed it, taking it out of his ring would take time. Life or death could be decided in an instant, and too many things can happen during this time. What he didn’t know was that even with Bai Qingqing’s identity, she only had three bottles of these pills from home. Yet Bai Qingqing had given him a bottle without hesitation and hadn’t told him how important these pills were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From what they heard from the villagers, the mountain Han Songcheng was hiding in was not far away. Their speed had already reached the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Strange, we could not sense their auras at first, but after we caught up, the distance between us always remained the same. When we slow down, they slow down, and when we speed up to the extreme, the gap isn’t closing.” Bai Qingqing’s brows were furrowed tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge silently pondered. He was also puzzled by this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yellow Flower Ridge, Fallen Leaf Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was where Han Songcheng lived. The entire peak had been turned into an impregnable iron barrel. This was his nest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Han Songcheng finally returned to Fallen Leaf Mountain with the exhausted Vulture. His grey sword was floating above Fallen Leaf Mountain. Feeling the two spirit force fluctuations not far behind him, Han Songcheng didn’t panic and instead laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many roads to walk in this world, yet you have to rush into the door to hell. Hmph, I originally planned to head over at night to deal with you two, but I didn’t expect you two to come to death’s door yourselves. Do you really think I, Han Songcheng, am someone easy to bully?” Han Songcheng’s face became ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mountain Lord, let us go back and get ready. This time, there is money and a beauty. Both of them are very young and seem to have good family backgrounds. In particular, that little lady, hehe.” Vulture had a lecherous smile on his face. Although his spirit force was exhausted, when he mentioned Bai Qingqing, his eyes burned with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No rush, wait until they come closer, then we will make our move. As long as they come, I’m confident in dealing with them. Hehe, I’ll be busy tonight.” Then the two of them laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the two auras in front suddenly stop, not only did Bai Qingqing not feel happy, she felt worried. Finally, at the next moment, both Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s pupils shrank and they looked into the distance.</span></p>
