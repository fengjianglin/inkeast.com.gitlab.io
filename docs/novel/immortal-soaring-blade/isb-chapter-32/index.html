 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge ignored her and put on a cool front. When Su Su saw this, she grinded her teeth in anger. She wanted to use some force and pinch that face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge endured the discomfort in his body and used what little spirit force he had left. Golden light covered his body and lit up the night, allowing him to see the unmarked graves clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang, boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green spirit light and the dazzling, golden light collided. After colliding, the spirit force scattered, creating a terrifying scene in the sky above the unmarked graves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful ripple spread out and hit all the coffin lids in range, causing knocking sounds to echo. All the coffins around the area shook and the soil trembled. If one looked closely, wisps of grey smoke filled the air and all the grass within the area withered after the collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several collisions of spirit force, sweat started to drip from Zhao Jiuge’s face and his face had grown pale. His old injuries, new injuries, and exhaustion from using too much spirit force made him feel weak. Zhao Jiuge felt like he couldn’t breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny man’s eyes were filled with excitement. He looked at Zhao Jiuge’s powerless expression and licked his lips as if he could already taste the delicious food in his mouth. The closer the prey was to being captured, the more eager he became. He felt like they had been entangled for too long and he was getting a bit impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His right hand grabbed the little bell on his waist. It was the size of his palm and was brass-colored. There were two blackish-brown runes parallel to each other in the middle of the bell. The entire bell gave off a weird feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp sound echoed, and waves of grey ripples echoed across the sky. It sounded nice at first, but soon after, a powerful headache struck, as if your skull was being stabbed by needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s already pale face became painful as if he was about to crumble. However, Su Su stood there as if nothing was happening and quietly observed the situation. The crisp sounds of the bell echoed through the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crackle, crackle, crackle...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding hundreds of red coffins that were placed in a pattern all began to shake and suddenly erupted. The decaying coffins all broke and splinters scattered onto the ground, mixing with the soil. An even stronger smell of decay arose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After smelling the pungent smell of the rotting corpses, the originally calm Su Su suddenly became shocked and the smile on her face was gone. The difference was so great, it was as if she had become a different person. This was the first time Zhao Jiuge had seen Su Su with an uncertain expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at all the movement around them as the hundreds of coffins shook violently. The coffin lids broke, exposing the rotting corpses inside. Some bodies were all dried up with no trace of blood, while some corpses still had rotting flesh. It was unknown how long they had been there. Just looking at them would make you want to puke. Zhao Jiuge cursed the skinny man in his mind while trying to think of a way to deal with the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge suddenly noticed that when the ripples from the bell reached the corpses, many of the corpses in the coffins began to move. He was completely stunned. In Zhao Jiuge’s mind, he thought that the most amazing thing he had seen in his life was when he saw Bo Re slice the flood dragon. He always fantasized about how one day he would soar through the world on a flying sword and right all the wrongs in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rising his sword, pointing down, and smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There might be nothing more amazing than this in the cultivation world. However, today, meeting the skinny man let him know just how mysterious and strange cultivation could be, and this also sounded an alarm in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His cultivation path had been somewhat smooth, so he had gotten overly proud, but right now he was like a frog at the bottom of a well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The movement around them became more and more violent, causing an extreme sense of unease. Even though Zhao Jiuge was a fool, he knew the danger. He no longer cared about keeping his pride as a man before Su Su and quickly pulled out the Li Fire Flag he had gotten in Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held the flag in his right hand, and the Li Fire Flag flapped in the wind created by this uneasy atmosphere. At this moment, the skinny man was chanting while shaking the brass bell. Ripples echoed through the air as if it was water, and the spirit force ripples created by the bell gave off a cold aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at this in horror as his heart pounded nonstop. He raised his right hand and injected spirit force into the Li Fire Flag. A flash of silver light appeared on the surface of the flag and then nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was dumbfounded as he stared at the Li Fire Flag in his hand, while the movements from the skinny man became even more intense. Su Su looked at Zhao Jiuge’s dumbfounded gaze and couldn’t help but roll her eyes. She placed her right hand on her head and couldn’t help but say, “You really are a block head. A precious treasure is different from a magic treasure. Quickly, control your mind and use your spirit force. If you don’t, even if you get a heavenly treasure in the future, you still won’t be able to use it. You are so stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no time to be embarrassed, so he quickly followed Su Su’s instructions. He calmed his mind and injected his spirit force into the Li Fire Flag. Then he controlled his mind and carefully entered the Li Fire Flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hot aura suddenly appeared. It turned out that the Li Fire Flag was refined from a clump of Li Fire found deep inside a volcano. It was also composed of Black Gold, Heavenly Silk, and other materials to seal the Li Fire inside a pocket space within the flag. When facing your enemy, you would only need to control it with your mind with the help of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mysteries of nature not only made people marvel at it, but also made them feel so small. Nothing remained the same. No matter how beautiful something was, it would eventually become old. No matter how beautiful a flower, it would eventually wither. Only by becoming immortal could one exist as long as the world. However, the path to immortality was filled with danger, and it was a difficult road to walk on, but cultivating was already defying the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no lack of dangerous and strange places in the world. There were many strange things between the mountains and rivers, so things like spirit veins, earth fire, cold springs, and such would appear based on the prosperity of the land. Some of the things produced were equal to powerful cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why when a person walked on the thin ice that was the path of cultivation, it was inevitable to feel love and fear. They loved that the world was filled with various treasures and strange things that could strengthen their cultivation. They feared that the path of cultivation was difficult, that every step was one of life and death and must be tread carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sizzle, sizzle... Sizzle...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Li Fire inside the flag was released, the spirit force in the air became distorted. The fire entangled with the grey smoke and the grey smoke was burnt away. The sound was like when Zhao Jiuge played with firecrackers during new year, or when he was helping his grandfather maintain the stove.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mass of Li Fire was several meters tall. The lower half was yellow and white, while the upper half was orange. Due to the night breeze, it was as if several fire snakes were dancing. It also brought some warmth to the depressing atmosphere. The light made Zhao Jiuge’s nervous heart feel warm and relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny man with the brass-colored bell was very calm, as if everything was within his control. When he saw the fire suddenly appear, he was shocked and his heart missed a beat or two. He quickly raised the bell above his head and it began to ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny man cultivated the crooked and evil path, so he was naturally afraid of Li Fire and Gang Thunder. Since ancient times, evil was suppressed, and Li Fire and Gang Thunder were made by heaven to punish them. When against evil, their power would increase several fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the urging of the brass bell, the closest ring of red coffins exploded and the rotting corpses inside actually stood up. They wobbled toward Zhao Jiuge and Su Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These rotting corpses all had some grey or dark green smoke around their bodies. Zhao Jiuge knew that the smoke was poisonous, so how could he let the corpses get close? Not to mention these were merely the closest—there were still hundreds of coffins left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge no longer hesitated and waved the Li Fire Flag. His mind controlled the Li Fire to fly forward and surround these dozen or so corpses.</span></p>
