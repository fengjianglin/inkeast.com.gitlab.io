 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Money Rat’s eyes, Daoist Yi Qing was extremely powerful, but he had been easily reduced to ashes by this old man. This caused Money Rat to tremble. He wanted to beg for mercy, but due to the fear in his heart, his teeth clattered too much for him to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, Money Rat’s eyes widened as he saw the same purple thunder flying toward him. He didn’t even have time to react, and in his final moment of consciousness, he was still thinking about begging for mercy. The Purple God Thunder instantly surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the two villains completely destroyed, Su Su felt a bit better. Thinking about Money Rat’s insulting words and Daoist Yi Qing’s ugly methods, Su Su felt no sympathy for them when they were completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then she looked at Zhao Jiuge, who was still lying on the ground, and her heart unconsciously ached. She quickly rushed over like a baby swallow as she looked caringly at Zhao Jiuge and anxiously asked, “Jiuge, why are you do dumb?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished speaking, she looked at the old man with a lovely expression and said, “Grandpa Yang, come and check on him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man suddenly revealed a look of helplessness and seriously looked at the young man lying on the ground. He took out a crystal-clear pill and fed it to Zhao Jiuge. The pill gave off a refreshing fragrance. Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what it was, but he felt a cool feeling enter his body, and it was repairing his meridians. Su Su looked at Zhao Jiuge’s weakened state and quickly helped him sit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man waved his sleeve and spirit light covered Zhao Jiuge’s body. This healed all of Zhao Jiuge’s external injuries. This secretly shocked Zhao Jiuge. Who was this old man and who exactly was Su Su?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man observed the young man before him and thought about everything he had done while with Su Su. After a while, he smiled as a form of approval and said, “Kid, you’re pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice was plain, but for Zhao Jiuge, who worshiped the old man, he felt very happy, as if he had eaten honey. He revealed a big smile, but because of his injuries, it caused him to wince in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Su looked at Zhao Jiuge, she felt distressed and funny. Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was not in danger, she scolded, “Look at you, give you a bit of sunlight and you’re bright, but give you a bit of flood and you rot. By the way, this is my grandpa, Yang.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was already accustomed to Su Su’s personality and humbly smiled at the old man. He respectfully said, “Nice to meet you, Grandpa Yang.” Afterward, he carefully looked at the old man and felt the old man’s undetectable power. Zhao Jiuge muttered inside his heart that this old man was beyond the Nascent Soul Realm—it was beyond his understanding of cultivation realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After escaping from the grasp of death, Zhao Jiuge’s mentality had evolved into the next level. Meeting this old man had also expanded Zhao Jiuge’s horizons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying a few words, the white-robed old man was going to take the two of them away when Zhao Jiuge quickly shouted at them to wait. Su Su and the old man were confused and were wondering what else there was when they saw Zhao Jiuge rush up next to where Daoist Yi Qing was. He picked up the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd and then looked embarrassingly at the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the old man only revealed a faint smile, and with a wave of his sleeve, they all arrived in the temple outside. This shocked Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At night, inside the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little beggar, the old man named Yang, Su Su, and Zhao Jiuge were all sitting around a table, happily chatting. Although they had only talked for a short period of time, the old man that was used to being alone liked the little beggar a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Su, you should have played enough, so it's time to go back with me. When you go back, you will enter closed-door cultivation and won’t be allowed to come out until you’ve formed your spirit core.” Although the old man named Yang had a kind gaze, his words were very stern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su pursed her lips and nodded helplessly. Her gaze shifted to Zhao Jiuge. There was a teasing gaze in her eyes and she smiled. “Jiuge, how about you come back with me? We can cultivate together. My family has a lot of resources and we can play together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished speaking, she looked at Zhao Jiuge with anticipation in her eyes, waiting for his answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man simply quietly looked at the two youths before him. He didn’t express his opinion, nor spoke a word to interrupt them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Su Su’s invitation, Zhao Jiuge’s heart was tempted and he began to ponder. He wanted to find a large and famous sect in order to obtain more resources as well as better and more complete guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given that Su Su was inviting him just based on their relationship, he wouldn’t be treated poorly, not to mention he would have a beauty to accompany him. However, after pondering for a bit, Zhao Jiuge gradually formed his own idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His struggle was replaced by determination and he shook his head. He looked apologetically at Su Su. “I know you are asking for my own good, but I’m a man and I have to bear more than you. I don’t want my life to become too comfortable. My teacher told me that cultivation is like crossing a river. Once you start, there is no retreat. Since I’ve embarked in this path, then I don’t wish to be ordinary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Zhao Jiuge had broken through to the Spirit Transformation Realm, his roots and bones were filled with spirit force. Coupled with his handsome face and his words, he gave off a commanding temperament. The little beggar sat on the side, looking at him in worship. Even the old man was smiling and nodding with satisfaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Su’s face filled with disappointment, Zhao Jiuge found it difficult to bear since they had been together for so many days. He softly said, “Once my cultivation is stronger, I’ll come to see you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Su Su softly agreed, and her mood improved. Her head was lowered and no one knew what she was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, how about this. Since you want to join a sect, I’ll help send you on your way tomorrow. Let’s forget about the small sects and take you directly to the capital. The seven holy lands recruit once every 10 years, and it is almost time. Otherwise, if you go by yourself, you will likely miss it and have to wait another 10 years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was so excited that he suddenly stood up and excitedly looked at the old man “Thank you, Senior. Then, I’ll trouble Senior.” After days of running, he had heard that he could immediately go to the place he wanted. How could he not be excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man faintly smiled. He was very satisfied with this youth. Whether it was Zhao Jiuge’s character or mentality, there was nothing bad to say. If not for the fact that this youth was not suitable for his cultivation method, he would have taken Zhao Jiuge as his disciple. As for the feelings between Zhao Jiuge and Su Su, he didn’t point them out. After all, they were still young—who knew what would happen in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, even if they wanted to be together, it would be very difficult, given Su Su’s identity, so might as well let things proceed naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The largest matter was settled, but he looked at the little beggar and couldn’t help but worry about this child’s fate. He was a bit embarrassed and struggled to open his mouth. “Senior, Junior has one more thing to trouble you with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man pointed at the little beggar and asked with a smile that wasn’t a smile, “Is it him?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge quickly nodded and impatiently asked, “Senior, this little beggar’s fate was unlucky and I can’t bear to see him wander outside like this. I implore you to take him with you, and in a few years, once I have stabilized myself, I’ll come pick him up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t know what Su Su’s family was like or where they were from, he was smart enough not to ask. If they hadn’t said anything, they had a good reason not to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s fine, I just happen to like this child.” The old man’s words were still plain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt like today was the happiest day in manys years. First, he had escaped from death, then he would be able to go the place he wanted to go, and finally the little beggar had a place to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge had a big smile. He said with a silly face, “Listen to Big Sister Su Su and Senior Yang. Big Brother will come to pick you up after a few years. We can’t just keep calling you ‘little beggar’ all the time. I’ll give you a name: Zhao Xiaotian.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young beggar looked at Zhao Jiuge with a confused gaze, but he knew that he was willing to listen to this big brother’s words. After living such a difficult life for so many years, this big brother was the only one who had been kind to him. He stored those words in the bottom of his heart. Most importantly, “Zhao Xiaotian” was a good name, and he finally had a name!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed a sweet smile and obediently promised, “I understand, Big Brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The candle light swayed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unbeknownst to them, this momentous today would change the fates of these three people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su still remained silent, as if she was thinking of something. She had a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second day, the four of them appeared in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All ready, we can go now.” The old man’s cold and plain words echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, Zhao Jiuge didn’t even clearly see what happened, they only saw the old man waving his sleeve. The three of them flew into a wooden boat in the sky. The spirit light from this boat was bright—it was even more advanced than the one Zhao Jiuge had seen Bo Re use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but secretly click his tongue. He curiously looked around the flying boat magical treasure. The clouds flew by before his eyes, but he didn’t feel a trace of wind in the boat. Zhao Jiuge was like a little money grubber that was envious of other people’s riches. His hands subconsciously touched the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd he had stolen from Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Xiaotian was also curious as it was his first time flying as well. This planted a seed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su proudly stood at the front of the boat with a cold face. Zhao Jiuge looked at her back with a sigh. There were a lot of things that he couldn’t say, so he could only bury them in the bottom of his heart. Once he had formed his core, he would go find her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clouds continued to fly by as the boat quickly moved through the sky like a meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the sun was setting, a large city finally appeared in the distance. Looking down, the capital city was like a chess board and the crowd of people were like ants. Zhao Jiuge’s mind was shaken by this sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The meadow on the outside of the Huaxia Dynasty’s capital city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge said his goodbyes to the three of them. Su Su still ignored Zhao Jiuge with a cold expression. Zhao Jiuge pursed his lips and waved his hand as he turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su finally could not hold back her feelings. She was reluctant to part after they have been together for so many days and burst out crying. She ran up and her hands were in a death grip around Zhao Jiuge’s waist. She choked out some words while crying, “Can’t you just come with me for me and not go to the capital city?” Her hoarse voice and pitiful appearance almost made Zhao Jiuge agree to Su Su’s request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lovingly rubbed her hair and gently said, “You always call me a block of wood and say that in your heart, I’ll always be a fool. But in my heart, you are always that spoiled, lively, cute Su Su. I’m reluctant to leave you as well, but I have to in order for us to have a better future together. I have to work hard on my cultivation to become strong, because I’m carrying far too much baggage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wish his teacher had left him, the figure in his heart he vowed to suppress, and so on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that this piece of wood could not be persuaded, Su Su took out two half pieces of jade that would form one whole. She handed one half to Zhao Jiuge and sniffled as she said, “I don’t care either way. Five years from today, I’ll wait at Green Jade Mountain. Bring this half of the jade with you and I’ll be able to sense it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After accepting the piece of jade, Zhao Jiuge solemnly nodded and agreed to this parting agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Yang looked at the young girl and young boy before him and his mouth let out a few unnatural twitches. He doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the scene of these two youngsters saying their goodbyes. The young Zhao Xiaotian curiously looked at the two of them, wondering why the big sister was crying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su left Zhao Jiuge’s embrace and gazed at him. This gaze made it seem as if she wanted to firmly engrave Zhao Jiuge’s appearance in her heart. This gaze seemed to tell the reluctance in her heart, but in the end, they still had to part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sunset, a youth walked down the grassy slope and kept looking back at the girl standing there. The light from the sunset shined on the youth’s back, and at that moment, he looked so desolate and lonely, yet his back was so broad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this parting, the two of them didn’t know when they would be able to meet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they met again, what kind of changes would have taken place? No one could be sure of anything, because time was a thing that made you see too much, tell you too much, but also made you lose too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth’s back gradually became smaller until he disappeared. The emotional Su Su remained there and refused to leave. Elder Yang felt helpless and just let her be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the side of the main road outside the capital city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grass extended as far as the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The steady wind was like a willow flute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun set behind the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In life, there were few gatherings but many partings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ask him when he will return when he leaves, at that time don’t hesitate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pot of unfiltered rice wine brings joy, say goodbye to the cold dreams tonight.&nbsp;</span></p>
