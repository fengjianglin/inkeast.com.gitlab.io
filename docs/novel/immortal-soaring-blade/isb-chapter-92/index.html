 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took feeble steps toward the youth with the scar. Every step penetrated the youth with the scar’s ears and made his heart skip a beat. It was like the hand of the king of hell holding his heart. When had the youth with the scar ever been in such an embarrassing state, with his body too weak to move? A bit of force would cause intense pain to spread across his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, this treasure is pretty good, what a pity.” Those words had no hint of irony or mockery. Zhao Jiuge had a pale face as he spoke with a complicated expression. However, that chuckle made the youth with the scar even more embarrassed—it was as if a thorn was stuck in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhao Jiuge spoke, he felt pain in his chest and kneaded it. Then he looked at the youth with the scar that was like a pile of mud on the ground. “However, a treasure depends on who is using it. Didn’t I tell you before? Don’t be too arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar who was lying on the ground trembled a bit, but the pain coming all over his body made him unable to speak. He could only let Zhao Jiuge scold him in a tone without any sarcasm, which made him feel even more uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar looked at Zhao Jiuge viciously. His face was flushed, but he was helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your elders gave you spells, magical treasures, and everything, but they didn’t teach you how to be a human. Then, let me teach you a lesson today.” At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s warm and calm expression suddenly became gloomy. His anger surged as he released a fierce kick that used all the power in his body toward the youth with the scar, who was lying on the ground in a miserable state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the kick landed on the youth with the scar, his body trembled a few times and a few muffled sounds came out. His face was filled with pain, but he clenched his teeth to keep himself silent. He was already in a sorry state, but if he succumbed to Zhao Jiuge, then he would only embarrass himself more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One kick, two kicks. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge looked a bit crazy to everyone. He was disregarding the injuries on his body and his face was bloodstained and even hideous. Each kick used all the strength in his body. It was as if he was trying to return all the grievances and insults he had suffered. This made a few people’s hearts feel a chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle went from a one-sided situation at the start to Zhao Jiuge making a comeback, then to the youth with the scar completely suppressing Zhao Jiuge. Finally, when Zhao Jiuge was about to lose, he used the mysterious spell to win in the end. This was far more exciting than everyone imagined this battle would be. The battle had started with a comparison of their swordsmanship, then it moved to a competition of spirit force, then it came down to the mysterious magic treasure and the mysterious spell in the end. Everyone was amazed and awed by Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people that ridiculed and even directly insulted Zhao Jiuge all had a complicated expressions and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had used his strength to viciously metaphorically slap them. In the end, he was the one who remained standing on the platform. Although he was exhausted, that was no longer important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the platform, the sounds of beating still echoed. Fortunately, Zhao Jiuge didn’t have any spirit force and was only using his physical power. If Zhao Jiuge had spirit force, then the youth with the scar would have already died, given his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three instructors only watched indifferently and didn’t stop, as it was reasonable for people to get hurt in battle. As long as there was no permanent damage, they would open one eye and close the other. Also, wasn’t the youth with the scar also kicking Zhao Jiuge when he was down earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t think that just because you’re a disciple from an influential family, you can rely on your family’s heritage to bully others. I, Zhao Jiuge, will still bite two pieces of flesh off you. Besides, you’re still too tender. You acted like you were going to deal with me earlier, but now you’re lying there like a dead dog.” At this point, he felt like he had beaten the youth with the scar enough. Zhao Jiuge took a deep breath, then he sharply gazed at the 80 or so people outside the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I, Zhao Jiuge, am a hillbilly from the mountains, but I’m not as easy to bully as you think. I can beat him today and I can beat more of you in the future. As the saying goes, if you’re unconvinced, then let’s fight! I’m not afraid of any challenge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When those words echoed, the entire audience became noisy. All the disciples from big families looked at Zhao Jiuge angrily. They were filled with dissatisfaction and showed signs of acting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well said, I stand with you,” a skinny youth with a dark complexion shouted excitedly. He was so excited that his face flushed red, and it was even more obvious with his dark complexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, similar voices echoed. Most were disciples from ordinary families. After just a few days, they were already getting sick of those disciples from big families acting like they were superior. They hadn’t been in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect for long, but there was already hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the disheveled hair stood on the stone platform like a murderous god. His whole body was bloodstained and his skin was cut open. No matter how embarrassing of a state he was in, he stood tall like a mountain, and his body exuded killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The calm and cold Leng Rufeng hadn’t shown any emotion no matter how amazing Zhao Jiuge’s performance was. However, when he heard those words, there was a smile on his face. The corner of his mouth rose up with a hint of playfulness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Zhao Jiuge is a bit interesting. He is someone who cares a lot about relationships. If there is a chance, I should interact with him and see if we can be friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two had the exact same thoughts! When Zhao Jiuge saw this person obtain the Spirit Tempering Pill, he had the exact same thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun, who never showed his emotions and thoughts, raised his head and glanced at Zhao Jiuge. He didn’t even bother to hide his disdain. At this moment, Mu Zijun stopped being a hypocritical snake and drew a clear line with Zhao Jiuge, completely tearing off all pretense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo was also someone who had the same thought. He looked at Zhao Jiuge with jealousy, but he quickly withdrew his emotions and lowered his head. It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge, not even 10 years later. Not to mention he would have plenty of time to deal with Zhao Jiuge in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In contrast, Bai Qingqing, who was also someone from a strong family, smiled carelessly. Her smile attracted the attention of the older disciples in the air. She was sincerely happy for the first friend she had made since coming here. At the same time, her heart ached while looking at his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge was not ready to give up. He withdrew his gaze from the audience and looked at the youth with the scar with killing intent. “Just make an apology and it will be considered over, or else it will be my turn to deal with you.” After he finished speaking, he released an invisible killing aura that made it feel like was really going to kill the youth with the scar if didn’t intend to apologize. Zhao Jiuge had killed Wang Dazhuang, so he naturally had a bit of the temperament. And all the encounters he had before coming here were life-threatening, so he more or less had some of the bloodlust contaminated on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was not someone who was easy to bully. It was obvious from his crazed behavior of killing Wang Dazhuang. Droplets like kindness would be repaid with a pool. But if you dared to provoke him, then be prepared to be paid back tenfold. He drew a clear distinction between kindness and grudges.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for a few breaths and seeing that the youth with the scar wouldn’t move, Zhao Jiuge seemed to become impatient. He frowned and was about to step on the youth with the scar’s head. Just as he was about to lift his foot, Instructor Zhou’s words echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop. This competition stops at the touch.” With those words from Instructor Zhou, two rays of light surrounded them. Zhao Jiuge felt his body become light, then he flew into the air before steadily landing on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Li’s expression was a little serious and he no longer had the kind smile on his face like he used to. He quickly picked up the youth with the scar and disappeared into the mountains in a ray of light. He was likely going to heal the youth with the scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These elders allowed the disciples to fight in order to pressure them to grow and give them more vigor. However, it was impossible to allow things to get too out of hand and damage the roots. When they saw Zhao Jiuge move for the killing blow, the three instructors could naturally not let it continue and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s unfulfilled expression, Instructor Zhou kindly said, “There will still be chances to compete in the future. This time, you won.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The always-stern Instructor Zhou smiled at Zhao Jiuge. Then his voice filled with spirit force spread across the square. “This time, Zhao Jiuge won the fight. I hope you all will steadily move forward. Not only will you compete with your fellow disciples, you will also compete with other sects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he said a few words to announce the result of the fight, he quickly changed the topic to the competition against the other sects. When the new disciples heard this, they immediately became passionate. They wished they could go out now and fight against the disciples of the other sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Youth never lacked passion, and one word could often make them forget about their worries and aim for what they desired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Instructor Zhou announced the result, the audience went into an uproar. Some people laughed and started praising Zhao Jiuge’s victory and admirable strength. Those last few words were the highlight, and they drew the hearts of many disciples with ordinary family backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, this battle had allowed Zhao Jiuge’s reputation to spread across the Mysterious Heaven Peak. Even the older disciples knew that there was a young man named Zhao Jiuge among the new disciples who had strength that even made them feel dread. They believe that this child would eventually turn into a dragon—he was just waiting for time to transform him.</span></p>
