 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Bai Qingqing heard this, she held her hand out before Bai Zimo. Right now, Bai Zimo had no spirit force, so she wasn’t worried he would try something. When Bai Zimo took out the Blood Colored Camellia, the Heaven’s Not Old, and the Moon Star, Bai Qingqing smiled proudly as she put them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I go now?” Bai Zimo looked angrily at the robber that had ransacked him. All the effort he had spent last night was wasted. It has to be said that three days was not a lot, and now he had lost three herbs. It would be impossible to gather all the materials now. Instead of being able to shine in the limelight, he had suffered a lot. Bai Zimo secretly remembered this and would find a chance to get revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go.” With the herbs in hand, Bai Qingqing couldn't care less about Bai Zimo anymore. It was also impossible for her to act against him after he had handed over the herbs. What’s more, they were from the same sect, so even less reason to do so. Besides, she wanted to go see how Zhao Jiuge’s injuries were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Zimo heard Bai Qingqing’s words, he quickly ran next to the slender youth and then rushed toward the Mysterious Heaven Peak. He had completely given up on this test. When he turned around, his eyes became dark and vicious, revealing his ruthlessness. He cursed in his head,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qinqing, you two sluts just wait. Next time, I’ll show you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Bai Zimo disappear with the slender youth, Bai Qingqing immediately rushed next to Zhao Jiuge to check on his injuries. The joy in her eyes from ransacking Bai Zimo had faded and her beautiful eyes were now filled with concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are you? Why does it look so serious this time?” Zhao Jiuge’s face was sickly pale and there was a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth. His breathing was weak and he looked like he could fall to the ground at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Sanskrit Divine Body was shattered by Bai Zimo’s Three Star Shield, Zhao Jiuge felt like all his meridians were being pulled. The intense pain made him tremble, and the spirit force in his body became unstable. This caused his blood flow to become so chaotic that he coughed out a mouthful of essence blood. How when he cycled the spirit force in his body, just the touch of spirit force on his meridians made him feel pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the pain, his face was fierce and he sucked in a breath of cold air. He ignored Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s sorry state, Bai Qingqing’s brows furrowed and she tried to think of something. After thinking for a long time, she said, “Generally, the backlash from a spirit treasure is extremely serious. Fortunately, Bai Zimo’s cultivation is too shallow to release the true power of that shield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhao Jiuge heard Bai Qingqing’s nagging, he endured the intense pain in his body and said in a hoarse voice, “Then is there any method to resolve it? Just talking about it is useless. If this goes on like this, forget getting first place, I’m afraid I’ll miss that fight. Even rushing back will be a problem. I feel terrible right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh. you still have the strength to speak, it seems like you are fine. Besides, who told you to interrupt me?” Bai Qingqing stared at him with dissatisfaction in her beautiful eyes and lifted her chin. Seeing how Zhao Jiuge could speak, she relaxed a bit and felt that he would be fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cultivate like usual, bear with it. Your meridians are all damaged from the backlash, but by the looks of it, it's not too serious. After your spirit force makes a few cycles, it will naturally help your meridians recover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge knew that Bai Qingqing had an extraordinary background, so he didn’t hesitate to believe her words. After all, from their time together, he could see that Bai Qingqing knew a lot more than him, whether it was in cultivation or things related to cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly closed his eyes and sat down on the grass. His brows were furrowed and bean-sized sweat drops fell from his forehead. When the spirit force cycled through his body, he couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air. As soon the spirit force started cycling through his body, he felt like someone was cutting him with a knife, causing his face to become twisted. How was this mere pain like Bai Qingqing had said? This was worse than death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That painful expression made Bai Qingqing unable to bear to watch, so she turned her head and observed the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The intense pain also triggered Zhao Jiuge’s stubborn temper. The more it hurt him, the more he tried to endure it. After his spirit force cycled through his body a few times, it was unknown if he was numb to the pain or his body was slowly healing, but the pain from before was decreasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is it!?” Bai Qingqing let out a shout and awakened Zhao Jiuge. He opened his eyes and saw Bai Qingqing look toward the forest not far away. He heard footsteps coming from there and vaguely felt two figures approaching. Zhao Jiuge was secretly shocked. Could it be that Bai Zimo was unwilling to just lose the herbs and had come back?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few breaths, the two figures closed in. It was a man and woman, both wearing blue sword robes. The man was fat and the woman was pure—it was Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger. When Zhao Jiuge saw that it was them, he relaxed his tense heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Bai Qingqing still coldly started at Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger because she didn’t know them. She was secretly on guard and was ready to use the little spirit force she had left after that big battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger also saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. Liu Yinger smiled happily and exclaimed, “Jiuge, you are there too!” Her eyes became more energetic and her pace even accelerated as she rushed toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing relaxed her guard. From what she saw, she knew those two knew Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiuge, what are you two doing here? A man and woman all alone?” The scene before him was indeed easy to confuse one and leave things to the imagination. Zhao Jiuge was sitting cross-legged on the grass, and Bai Qingqing was sitting beside him. No wonder Wang Baiwan would reveal a playful smile and tease Zhao Jiuge. He looked at Zhao Jiuge and then at Bai Qingqing. He observed their faces as if he wanted to notice something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger’s happy face stiffened and she thought that the two people before her were a bit indecent. She was stunned for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Wang Baiwan’s teasing words, Bai Qingqing’s guard came up once more and she prepared to condense her spirit force once more. Her brow curled unkindly as she stared at Wang Baiwan, and she was about to vent the anger in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are the two of us doing? We are doing your uncle! Don’t you see I'm injured?” Knowing Bai Qingqing’s personality, Zhao Jiuge quickly spoke up before her. Otherwise, Bai Qingqing wouldn’t care about the situation and would cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, what’s wrong?” After hearing that Zhao Jiuge was injured, the stunned Liu Yinger immediately looked at Zhao Jiuge with concern. She looked everywhere for where Zhao Jiuge was injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt a bit embarrassed and rubbed his head. He wanted to change the subject because he didn’t think Liu Yinger would react like that. Bai Qingqing coldly looked at this, but then a playful smile appeared on the corner of her mouth. She was a bit surprised that there was someone who actually liked this block of wood. Women matured early, and at 16 years old, Bai Qingqing immediately understood Liu Yinger’s intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan was also secretly laughing, but he didn’t joke about it. Both Bai Qingqing and Wang Baiwan silently agreed to not speak up to help Zhao Jiuge. This left Zhao Jiuge grabbing his hair and not knowing what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Yinger, how did you and Wang Baiwan find your way here?” Finally, he felt like the situation was a bit too embarrassing, so he asked Liu Yinger a question to change the subject. At the same time, he felt a bit better and also some pain as he hadn't fully recovered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Baiwan and I heard a miserable cry yesterday. We then came this direction out of curiosity and found you two.” At the end, Liu Yinger looked meaningfully at Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, so it's like that. Yesterday, we ran into a Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf and killed it. Earlier today, we ran into the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, but then we ran into Bai Zimo right after.” Zhao Jiuge patiently explained what happened after they entered the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Wang Baiwan became excited and his eyes lit up. “So what happened? Did you guys fight? Who won?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge pouted and gestured toward Bai Qingqing with his mouth. Wang Baiwan was confused and had doubt in his eyes. Zhao Jiuge rolled his eyes. “With our Big Sister Qingqing here, how could we not win?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing seemed to be very happy after hearing this. She proudly raised her chin and folded her arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Wang Baiwan’s mouth twitched a few times. He knew something about this woman and had the same mindset that Zhao Jiuge originally had: stay as far away from her as possible. He didn’t think that Zhao Jiuge’s attitude toward her would change so much after just one day, even to the point that he would affectionately call her “Big Sister Qingqing.” Seeing the two of them like this, he believed something must have happened after they entered the mountains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In contrast, Liu Yinger was absent-minded on the side, in a trace. She could not hide the disappointment she felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan seemed to suddenly think of something and asked, “That’s right, Jiuge, how many herbs did you guys find? We only found the Sulphur Grass and Heaven’s Not Old.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Wang Baiwan’s words, Zhao Jiuge laughed mischievously, which caused his injuries to flare up. He sucked in a breath due to the pain. “You guys only have two kinds, we have five kind. White Drew Frost, Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, Blood Colored Camellia, Heaven’s Not Old, and Moon Star.” After he finished speaking, he triumphantly revealed five fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger’s turn to be shocked. The two of them hadn’t idled at all last night but had only found two herbs. Unexpectedly, Zhao Jiuge had found five herbs already. When Wang Baiwan heard that they didn’t have the Sulphur Grass, he quickly said, “We know where to get Sulphur Grass. When we started heading here last night, we passed by a waterfall, and there was sulphur grass under it. Liu Yinger and I only picked a little, I think it's called the Luo Sunset Valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?! Then take us there.” Zhao Jiuge could not help but exclaim after hearing this. If that was really the case, then he would only be short the Lilac Water. Only one out of three days had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan nodded, but after he saw Zhao Jiuge’s sorry state, he couldn’t help but ask, “Okay, but can you walk with your injuries? It's a bit far, we can wait until you recover.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not an issue. The earlier we go, the earlier we can go pick the herbs the less likely something will happen to the herbs before we get there.” After he finished speaking, Zhao Jiuge impatiently stood up, grinning. He completely ignored the injuries in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the side, Bai Qingqing helplessly shook her head. He was really a desperate fellow. In order to get sect contributions, he didn’t even care about his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her beautiful eyes looked at Zhao Jiuge’s back with a complicated gaze, and she couldn’t help but sigh. Maybe one day, Zhao Jiuge’s name would really ring through the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, and maybe even the Huaxia Dynasty. Thinking about strength, Bai Qingqing’s gaze became unfocused and filled with longing.</span></p>
