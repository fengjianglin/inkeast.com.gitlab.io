 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

They completely forgot the fear and tension as they were completely enchanted by the dazzling colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qiusheng’s mouth was wide open and he was extremely shocked. Then he said, “Dad, I’m also going to find a teacher and become an immortal. When the time comes, don’t be stingy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finished speaking, he thought Yu Qingshan would scold him and knock him on the head. Instead, Yu Qingshan just sighed. “Yes, go. As long as you have the heart, Dad will give away all of the family’s wealth to let you learn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene tonight had broadened his horizons. Even mountains of silver and gold were nothing to the strength of these immortals. Money was, after all, a material thing—it couldn’t bring life and you couldn’t take it with you when you died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thunderous rumbles were still echoing inside the yard. The battle between Zhao Jiuge, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery, and the Green Haired Zombie continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie was not at a disadvantage when facing two people. The rays of sword of energy first went through the silk-like black spirit force. They stopped for a moment before going through toward the Green Haired Zombie. However, after going through the black spirit force, the sword light only made a few crisp sounds and didn’t hurt the Green Haired Zombie at all before dissipating. The Green Haired Zombie did indeed have copper-like skin and iron-like bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately after, the cold white light from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery arrived. The Green Haired Zombie looked at the white light in disdain and only raised its left hand to block it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A crisp sound echoed and another wound appeared on its hand. Then a powerful stench erupted from the wound. It ignored its own injuries and rushed toward Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge was shocked when he saw that the sword energy did nothing; he panicked and immediately turned to run. Zhao Jiuge’s quick action saved him because the next second, a foul, poisonous gas filled the place where Zhao Jiuge had been standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge ran around the courtyard with the Green Haired Zombie following. Both were very fast, and one could almost hear the sound of wind howling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene shocked the people of the Yu family. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery stood in the middle of the yard. He was in somewhat of a sorry state, but he laughed out loud. “Haha, now it’s time for you to suffer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge heard this, he turned toward the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery and angrily shouted, “You better act quick. If you keep standing there and watching, I’ll lead the Green Haired Zombie to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he finished speaking, Zhao Jiuge felt the sound of wind become even louder and closer. This scared him, but he could only run faster. His cultivation was clearly stronger than the Green Haired Zombie;s, but he had still been forced into such a bad situation. He had all this power, but he didn’t know how to use it—he really lacked combat experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monaster laughed even more when he saw Zhao Jiuge’s anger. Then he slowly moved his left hand into his mouth. He frowned and bit down on his fingers. Essence blood flowed out and he wiped it on the wooden sword. His hand quickly moved across the wooden sword, drawing something. Strangely, not a lot of essence blood flowed out, but his face turned pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge saw the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s action while he was running and found it strange. However, he really envied how many treasures the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had. When he saw that the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was almost done preparing, he ran toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had a serious expression when he looked at the Green Haired Zombie. He raised the sword and chopped down. The blood-stained plum wood sword mercilessly landed on the Green Haired Zombie’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie was a yin attribute, while the essence blood was a yang attribute, so the damage done to the Green Haired Zombie was great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A burning sound came from the Green Haired Zombie’s skin. When the blood-stained plum wood sword stabbed the Green Haired Zombie, white smoke appeared. The Green Haired Zombie let out a miserable cry, but it didn’t take any substantial damage. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery also noticed this and was about to retreat. However, the Green Haired Zombie didn’t give him the chance—it swung its two hands, smashing into the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monaster was sent flying and blood flowed out from his nose and mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, Zhao Jiuge thought that the two of them had enough strength to deal with a Spirit Transformation zombie, but who would have thought that the situation would turn so fast? Zhao Jiuge immediately began to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery sent flying, the Green Haired Zombie lost its target and turned toward Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge quickly shouted, “Old Daoist, are you all right?” Although he found time to talk, his hands were not idle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hands moved and he muttered the sword art in his heart. Then the Blue Plum Sword floated into the air and began to buzz. The Slave Sword Art, taking the heart as the master and the sword as the slave. At the highest level, one could kill an enemy thousands of kilometers away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this key moment, Zhao Jiuge finally grasped how to use this technique. Although he wasn’t very skilled, a ray of blue light flashed through the air. The Blue Plum Sword stabbed toward the Green Haired Zombie. It was too fast for the Green Haired Zombie to react, so it couldn’t release any spirit force—it could only subconsciously block with its arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the two sides collided, the Green Haired Zombie’s arm flew into the sky and then fell to the ground. One of the Green Haired Zombie’s arms had been cut off with just one swing. The sword then flew back into Zhao Jiuge’s hand. Seeing the might of his sword art, Zhao Jiuge’s heart burst with joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery rolled a few times before getting up. He coughed a few times and said, “I’m fine, I won’t die so easily. It’s just that if you could have used the Slave Sword Art like that, why didn’t you do it earlier? You’ve forced this poor Daoist into this situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge rolled his eyes. “I just learned it, okay? Also, it’s you who is lacking. How come I haven’t been injured at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Green Haired Zombie wouldn’t give them time to talk. In an instant, it caught up to Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge felt that escaping was too humiliating and became hot-headed. He turned and swung the Blue Plum Sword at the zombie. The sword light caught the Green Haired Zombie off guard and it retreated several steps. Then it rushed forward once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and the Green Haired Zombie began fighting in close combat. One would occasionally send out a ray of sword light, while the other would spew out black poison mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge became anxious and roared, “Old Daoist, didn’t you claim that your branch is best at catching ghosts and dealing with demons? How come you can’t do anything against this spirit zombie? Do you have any skills?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s temper flared from Zhao Jiuge’s words, and he angrily said, “If you just rely on brute force to deal with this kind of yin object, your strength will be reduced greatly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then let me see how you deal with it. Didn’t you act all high and mighty when you came here? Now that you've been hit twice, you’re just standing there doing nothing.” Zhao Jiuge was gasping for breath while he spoke, and he still had to dodge the Green Haired Zombie’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nonsense, I was only hurt by this damn thing by accident. When dealing with yin objects, it is best to use fire or thunder attribute spells or treasures. My Li branch specializes in divine thunder spells. Hold that damn thing off for me and I’ll deal with it.” The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was so angry that he was running short on breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge no longer spoke and focused on dealing with the Green Haired Zombie. Originally, he thought he would have an easier time in close combat. However, the Green Haired Zombie used its powerful body and poison breath to force him into a sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge took advantage of an oversight from the Green Haired Zombie and sent out a kick. Then he threw the Blue Plum Sword toward the Green Haired Zombie’s head. The Green Haired Zombie ducked to avoid the sword, but the kick from Zhao Jiuge sent it flying backwards several meters. Zhao Jiuge used this chance to quickly pull away from the Green Haired Zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then his hand moved once more and the Blue Plum Sword began to buzz. He was going to control the sword to attack the Green Haired Zombie once more. This was only because Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation was too weak. In the future, he would be able to control the sword with his heart, and he would no longer need to use his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blue Plum Sword buzzed and shined brightly. It flew toward the Green Haired Zombie once more. Zhao Jiuge felt that about 20% of his spirit force had disappeared from his dantian. This made Zhao Jiuge’s mouth twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Daoist, you better hurry up. My spirit force won’t be able to last much longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery ignored Zhao Jiuge and was focused with his eyes closed. He was muttering something with a serious expression and would occasionally shake the plum wood sword in his hand. When Zhao Jiuge saw this, he wanted to rip off the old Daoist’s beard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blue Plum Sword instantly closed in on the Green Haired Zombie, but it had learned its lesson and was prepared this time. It raised its remaining hand and black spirit force surged out from its body. The Blue Plum Sword slowed down after going through the black spirit force, then the Green Haired Zombie’s sharp nails collided with it. The Blue Plum Sword was blocked, then it returned to Zhao Jiuge without inflicting much damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt like he only had 40% of his spirit force left, which made him anxious. It wasn’t that he didn’t have any way to deal with the zombie, but that would expose his Sanskrit Divine Body. Also, the golden dragons consumed too much spirit force. Once he used them, his spirit force would dry up. Unless it was his last resort, he wouldn’t place himself in a situation where he had no spirit force left. That would simply be too dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the old Daoist had said that he had a way of dealing with this, then Zhao Jiuge might as well let him. Unless his life was threatened, he was not going to show off his ace. The old Daoist said that only thunder and fire attributes were useful against yin objects. This made Zhao Jiuge think of the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd that he had obtained from Daoist Yi Qing. He wondered if he should use it first, because it wouldn’t use as much spirit force. Just at this moment, the Lord of &nbsp;the Qing Feng Monastery’s eyes opened up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes were dazzling and he pointed the plum wood sword at the sky. He then rushed forward and shouted, “Raise your head to the divine spirit. Yin objects, demons, and devils lower their heads. Watch my Heavenly Night Divine Thunder!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery finished his last word, the plum wood sword suddenly flew into the air. Zhao Jiuge and the rest of the Yu family stared at this scene dumbfoundedly!</span></p>
