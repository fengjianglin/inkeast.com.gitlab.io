 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That beautiful and alluring body no doubt had attracted everyone’s attention. A beautiful woman, especially a powerful one, would stimulate a man’s desire for conquest. So at this moment, all the males were filled with various emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the alluring girl reached the 800th step, she broke out in fragrant sweat. She no longer had the relaxed appearance she had before and her tender, white arms became stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, this girl was undoubtedly the number one among this batch of disciples. Even proud people like Bai Zimo and Mu Zijun had to admit she was strong even though they showed disdain on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mysterious Heaven Asura smiled. He was very happy right now. This didn’t match his usually wooden and cold face. Because his mood was so good, he began to stroke his beard even more frequently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, this little girl can’t reach the final steps. Three years from now, these disciples can enter the inner sect. Wu Tianshan, you have to cultivate well. Otherwise, you will be overtaken and lose face for your teacher. Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Tianshan had an awkward expression and his mouth had a helpless smile. He ran his fingers through his long hair and then relaxed. He then showed a relaxed expression and revealed a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, you and my teacher have been cultivating together for hundreds of years. Why has my teacher taken in several disciples but you still have no disciples? Your smiling face now looks much better than your normally stern face. Haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mysterious Heaven Asura became angry and loudly scolded, “Stinky brat, it seems like your skin has been itching lately. Let us practice now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Uncle, I’ll go back first to cultivate.” When he finished speaking, Wu Tianshan was already surrounded by a yellow sword light and flew away. He disappeared within only a few breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wu Tianshan left, the Mysterious Heaven Asura’s originally smiling face gradually became lonely. He had been lonely for many years. Who would want to be like this? However, there was a barrier he could not cross in his own heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sigh, he looked back at this batch of disciples and then, without blinking, ripples echoed through the space around him. In an instant, he disappeared. At this moment, the only thing that made him feel happy was this batch of disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the steps, the trial would end when the alluring girl ran out of spirit force and stopped. Everyone had different feelings in their hearts when the alluring girl could no longer go on. Instructor Zhou flew by on a flying sword and his loud voice echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This trial is over. 96 people have passed. Those people below the 300th step are all eliminated. The rest of you, congratulations, you are all now official members of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. From now on, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect is your home. Our Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect’s motto is don’t bully others with your strength, but if others bully you, then the entire sect will back you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou’s faint smile showed his affection for this batch of disciples. He was one that was cold to outsiders but warm to his own. Seeing how much better this batch of disciple was than the last two, how could he not be happy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His speech was filled with passion, which caused Zhao Jiuge, who had been afloat since his grandpa died, to feel a strong sense of belonging. At this moment, he was proud to be part of the sect. At this moment, he decided he was going to shine brightly for this sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, for the people that had failed, there was no passion. Instead, they felt cold, as if they had fallen into an ice cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those that found it difficult to accept this were stunned. Their mouths opened and closed, and they were filled with helplessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more emotional youths were all red-faced and caused a clamor because they were unwilling to accept this. If they missed this chance, they would have to wait 10 years, and at that point, they would no longer be qualified. How could they accept this after they had already seen the wonders of cultivation and the joy strength could bring?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, what sect has such strict entry requirements? Yue Hua Academy doesn’t have so many requirements!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If this place doesn't want me, then I don’t want this place. I don’t believe I can’t find a place that will take me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Instructor Zhou, can you please make an exception? Even if I just became an outer disciple, it would be fine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, voices of anger, begging, and despair echoed from the people that were disqualified. Zhao jiuge looked at them and felt melancholy. If he hadn’t encountered Ye Wuyou’s legacy that night, he might have been eliminated like them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed a smile of self-pity. More like if he hadn’t encountered Ye Wuyou, he wouldn’t even be on this path. He would have fled into the mountains or would still be in exile. There was not even a need to talk about meeting Su Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An angry snort came from Instructor Zhou’s nose, and the disciples couldn’t help but stutter. The surrounding temperature seemed to have lowered a few degrees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who dares to insult the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect?! It doesn’t matter who you are, you can forget about going down the mountain!” His words were filled with killing intent that beat down on the youths that dared to speak out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then Instructor Zhou waved his sleeve. He no longer spoke and returned to his cold expression. After Instructor Zhou moved, the dozens of disciples behind him flew into the air on their flying swords and took the people that had failed off the mountain. Perhaps this would be their last time at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou coldly looked at the people that were taken away for a while before he looked back at the remaining 90 or so people with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what family you are from or where you were born, the moment you enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, you must obey all of the sect’s rules. In a bit, you all will head up to pick up your disciple clothes, manuals, and your room allocations. You will only have one incense stick of time before you all must gather outside, where I’ll tell you more about my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not just one mountain, but a bunch of mountains connected together. The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect contained three factions spread across the thousands of peaks in this mountain range. New disciples could only go to two of three of these mountains. After all, they were only outer sect disciples, there was no way they would be allowed into the forbidden lands of the sect yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was looking around in shock. This completely terrified his heart. From the moment he entered the building to now, he thought the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was only so-so, but only now did he realize how wrong he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The peak of the mountain was naturally very high and was surrounded by white clouds. At this moment, cotton-like clouds appeared under their feet. Just by looking over, one could see one peak after another. A glance revealed that there were hundreds of peaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this didn’t count, because not only did each mountain contain strange-looking plants, there were also simple yet imposing buildings scattered across these peaks. There was one peak in the distance that stood out and was especially majestic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a chain like the one from the first trial connecting each peak. Due to the vast sea of clouds up here, only the peaks of the mountains were visible. It was like a mass of floating islands connected together—it was a spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the sun had risen up into the sky, and its golden light gave this wonderland a layer of sparkling gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sea of clouds and the simple yet imposing buildings created this extraordinary scheme. These seemingly floating mountain peaks were filled with dense spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s heart trembled greatly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this the immortal realm? Why is everything so beautiful? Everything is filled with fantastic colors!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking around, not only Zhao Jiuge, but the others who came up were also intoxicated by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gust of wind scattered the sea of clouds, the dense flowers, and the intoxicating feeling, drowning Zhao Jiuge. He looked around to see an irregularly shaped stone with four simple words carved on it: Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four words seemed to have been created by sword slashes. They gave off an ancient feeling, as if they had witnessed the ups and downs and all the changes of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a sect, the heritage of a holy land. Even though it had fallen, it was still not something people dared to look down upon. When the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect’s ancestor, Old Man Mysterious Heaven, soared into immortality, he occupied this beautiful place filled with abundant spiritual energy. These four words had been carved by Old Man Mysterious Heaven himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although these thousands of peaks looked normal, there was a large formation here that linked each peak together. This was why even after the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had fallen, it was able to maintain this place. It was something Old Man Mysterious Heaven had left for the sect before he ascended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the buildings and the strange plants, they were all the results of future generations building and breeding them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge understood why the woman in the pink dress and Bo Re looked at him like he was an ant. Given their temperament, they were likely from a famous sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge also firmed his heart to properly cultivate here at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. When he was strong enough, he would go meet Bo Re and take back his self-esteem. Looking at the scene before him, he felt like he was one step closer to that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vast scenery still remained in his heart, making him unable to calm down. Aside from this, that figure in his heart also made him unable to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blue-robed disciple’s shout awakened these youths that were immersed in their own thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quickly, come line up to register and pick up your stuff!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thin and long-faced youth lazily shouted. This youth who had arrived here more than a decade ago still hadn’t entered the inner sect or learned any profound sword technique. At this point, he had lost all spirit. He was like a monk that lived every day merely to ring the bell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when he first entered the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he was also like these new disciples. However, time had changed him too much. It had worn down the determination in his heart and caused all his goals to become nothing but fleeting dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the passion in the eyes of the youths that had just joined the sect today, the long-faced youth merely smiled and turned away. He was accustomed to the scene before him and was too lazy to even say an extra word.</span></p>
