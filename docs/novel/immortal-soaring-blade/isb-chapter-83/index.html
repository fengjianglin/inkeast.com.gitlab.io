 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a powerful pill fragrance spread across the square. The disciples couldn’t help but inhale the refreshing fragrance as they looked at the three-legged beast pill furnace floating before Instructor Li. They all longed for it, but in the end, they could only imagine because this was only a reward for the top three. They couldn’t help but look at the people that were going to obtain the Spirit Tempering Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Spirit Tempering Pill was finished, Instructor Li didn’t stop moving. His hands moved like flowing water and continued to form seals. Then his eyes suddenly shined and he waved his right hand. The lid of the pill furnace popped open and white gas rushed into the sky. This was some of the gas released from the Spirit Tempering Pill. It contained some medicinal effects, but most of the essence had been solidified into the Spirit Tempering Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, the white gas gradually disappeared. When all the gas disappeared, Instructor Li waved his hand and a blast of spirit force rushed into the pill furnace. The spirit force enveloped the nine yellow, bean-sized pills, and they flew out of the furnace. They were yellow, crystal clear, and gave off a powerful luster. This was what the Spirit Tempering Pill looked like!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all the disciples present, even people who had seen a lot, like Bai Qingqing and Mu Zijun, had never seen the Spirit Tempering Pill before. At this moment, the nine pills floated into the sky, and everyone eagerly looked at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nine pills suddenly split into three groups and flew toward the youth with the scar, Leng Rufeng, and Bai Qingqing. Seeing the three Spirit Tempering Pills in her hand that were still warm, Bai Qingqing was stunned. Her eyes became filled with passion as she looked curiously at the round Spirit Tempering Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, the Spirit Tempering Pills have been refined and given to you. In addition, sect contributions will also be given to you.” Instructor Li’s gentle words echoed throughout the square, then a few more rays of black light flew out into people's hands. They were diamond-shaped wooden tokens with sword patterns carved on them. They had the simple yet imposing words “Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sect contributions are recorded in the wooden tokens. Your sect contributions will be recorded there in the future. Use them to buy treasures in the Treasure Pavilion. I hope you all will go to the Mission Hall to collect more tasks in the future. It is also a way to hone your skills. Disciples that didn’t receive any sect contributions or Spirit Tempering Pills shouldn’t be discouraged. There are many more unknown things waiting for you in the future, but that's under the premise that you have enough strength. For the next three years, you will focus on learning the Sword Energy Elucidation. When you have reached the Foundation Realm, you will naturally be arranged to enter a spirit vein. If you disciples have anything you don’t understand, you can ask us instructors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After things had been distributed, Instructor Li patiently explained some issues to disciples. After the long talk, his eyes drooped slightly, and after a long period of time, he said some words that interested the other disciples. “Now that the mission was finished, let's talk about the fight that was agreed to three days ago. Since you are all very tired from searching for the herbs, let’s give them the night to recover. Tomorrow morning, come to the square, this will be your battleground. This time, not only us instructors, even the older outer sect disciples and inner sect disciples have heard the news. Who asked you guys to be the first to start a fight among the new disciples? The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect has not been lively in a while. I hope your performance tomorrow will not disappoint everyone. Okay, I’ll leave it at that. All of you go back and rest early.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Instructor Li finished speaking, he looked at the other two instructors. The corners of their mouths curved up into playful smiles, but their eyes were filled with expectation. The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect never prevented disciples from competing with each other—they needed this kind of vigor. At this moment, the three instructors seemed to see the hope of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect among these disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Instructor Li finished speaking, the atmosphere of the square was pushed to the peak. The disciples all became heated. Everyone was excited. At the same time, they wanted to know the result of the fight between the youth with the scar and Zhao Jiuge. One was Zhao Jiuge, mysterious and handsome. The other was the youth with the scar, who was like domineering like a peerless beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them collided, what kind of sparks would erupt? Not only were the instructors looking forward to it, the new disciples were looking forward to it as well. At this moment, there were no less than 20 people gathered around the youth with the scar, and there were even people at the Spirit Transformation Realm among them. On the other hand, Zhao Jiuge only had Wang Baiwan, Liu Yinger, Bai Qingqing, Mu Zijun, and company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar didn’t know why, but when he saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing together, he became very angry. He couldn’t stand seeing the figure he admired stand beside Zhao Jiuge. Since he couldn’t do anything about her, he could only place all his anger on Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a cold snort, he stared at Zhao Jiuge with contempt and left without much action. Tomorrow, he was going to show Zhao Jiuge what a lesson was like!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge just smiled indifferently, facing the attitude of the youth with the scar. He didn’t become angry or said any cruel words. Zhao Jiuge also wanted people to know that he was not easy to bully and that not just anyone could step on his head. Zhao Jiuge also had another thought in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to use the youth with the scar as a stepping stone. Tomorrow, he would put himself on display so that more people would pay attention to him. Then, when he entered the inner sect, he could find someone powerful to become his teacher. Only then could he enjoy better resources and better treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge immediately sat down on his wooden bed after he turned. Tomorrow was his fight against the youth with the scar. He had to seize the last moment to adjust himself into peak state to fight against the youth with the scar. At the same time, he held the Spirit Tempering Pill that Bai Qingqing had stuffed into his hand. He was wondering what he could do overnight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing wanted to give him two Spirit Tempering Pills, but he had only taken one because she had also given her sect contributions to him. Zhao Jiuge didn’t like to owe others too much, and one Spirit Tempering Pill was enough for him. After thinking for a while, he made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, he would consolidate his cultivation, then he would consume the Spirit Tempering Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He closed his eyes and entered a cultivation state. He had been on the run for several days from his first battle against the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf and then the fierce battle against Bai Zimo. Not only was the spirit force in his body unstable, he still had some minor injuries that hadn’t healed. He was going to get rid of all those hidden injuries and then use the Spirit Tempering Pill to make progress on his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although days of fierce battles had put him in a sorry state, his spirit force had improved a lot. The youth with the scar was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, but Zhao Jiuge was still confident because he had the mysterious Sanskrit Divine Body. In the past, he cultivated the golden dragon that could attack, but now he had the buddha, which greatly improved his defense. Zhao Jiuge didn’t feel any pressure when facing the youth with the scare, and instead he wanted to compete against the youth with the scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be said that the spiritual energy at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was certainly abundant. He almost felt like he was getting twice the result with half the effort. He hadn’t been here for long, but with each passing day, he clearly felt his spirit force increasing. The surrounding spiritual energy entered his body and was slowly turned into spirit force by his Sanskrit Heart Sutra. His injured meridians were also slowly recovering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only at this moment did the effect of the Moonlight Dew reveal itself. When cultivating at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he could tell that the spiritual energy was stronger here, but only after taking the Moonlight Dew could he clearly feel the difference. The spiritual energy inside his body moved faster and more spiritual energy than before rushed into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was secretly shocked at how magical the Moonlight Dew was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t know that it was only because this cultivation level was low that the effects were so noticeable. After he entered the Foundation Realm and condensed his foundation formation, he could automatically absorb spiritual energy to convert into spirit force. Moreover, after breaking through to the next realm, the amount of spirit force required would drastically increase. When Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation improved, he would find this effect insignificant. Although heaven would always leave a glimmer of hope on the path to immortality, everyone was balanced. Nothing would be too heaven-defying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After drinking the Moonlight Dew, he only tasted some dry sweetness and then nothing. He originally thought it didn’t have much effect. Only now did he finally begin to feel its true effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once his cultivation stabilized, Zhao Jiuge suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the bean-sized Spirit Tempering Pill in his right hand. Finally, a determined gaze appeared in his eyes and he delivered the fragrant Spirit Tempering Pill to his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unspeakable feeling suddenly spread across Zhao Jiuge’s body—a combination of pain and joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Spirit Tempering Pill entered his body and turned into liquid, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but tremble. At first he felt like there were thousands of ants crawling through his meridians, making him feel very itchy, then itching turned into pain. It was as if someone was squeezing all the meridians in his body with a powerful hand. This feeling of soreness was almost unbearable. As his whole body trembled from enduring the pain, Zhao Jiuge found something amazing. He decided to clench his teeth and endure it.</span></p>
