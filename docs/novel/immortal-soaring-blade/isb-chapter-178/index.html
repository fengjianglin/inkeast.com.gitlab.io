 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What surprised Zhao Jiuge was that the person leading the group of the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples was a female disciple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beside her were three youths who followed half a step around her. A yellow sword robe outlined her petite figure, but her skin was dark and she gave off a cold aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge, after getting used to looking at Bai Qingqing, felt that the girl from the Mysterious Strange Peak had an okay figure, but her chest was flat and her appearance was also ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn't have the small mountains on her chest like Bai Qingqing, nor did she have Bai Qingqing’s alluring face. Even that cold expression made Zhao Jiuge feel like she was making a fool of herself; it was not as moving as Bai Qingqing’s cold expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhao Jiuge staring at the girl from the Mysterious Strange Peak and seeing the smile on his face, Bai Qingqing already knew what he was thinking. She couldn’t help but let out a cold snort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl seemed to notice Zhao Jiuge’s gaze, but her eyes became even more cold. However, she revealed an inexplicable smile. She was like a sword that was ready to unsheath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Late stage of the Foundation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the girl releasing her aura, the three youths behind her also released their auras, filled with killing intent. Two early stage Foundation Realm and one mid stage Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This startled Zhao Jiuge. He didn’t expect the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect to have so many hidden powers. Just the Mysterious Strange Peak had strength not to be underestimated, and he didn’t know if these were all their Foundation Realm cultivators. After all, many people had not arrived at the top yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was always reluctant to fall behind. Seeing the other side provoke them, her face tightened and she released her late stage Foundation Realm aura. She seemed like she was going to suppress all four of them by herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of the three youths on the other side changed. However, the girl’s eyes lit up like she felt threatened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the youths beside the girl whispered into her ear, “Senior Sister Zhang Pin, do you want to attack now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without even thinking, Zhang Pingquan shook her head. However, facing Bai Qingqing’s powerful aura, she revealed a brilliant smile. She raised her right hand and made the gesture of cutting her throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing saw Zhang Pingquan’s provocation, her expression changed and she was about to attack. Zhao Jiuge quickly moved and pulled her arm. Originally, he wanted to wrap his arm around Bai Qingqing’s waist because it was very comfortable, but seeing how angry Bai Qingqing was, he didn’t have the courage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge whispered, “Don’t argue, now is not the time. Let’s see what happens first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they acted now, they wouldn’t be the fisherman but instead would do work for others. Although Bai Qingqing had stopped moving, her chest was still heaving up and down. Her face slowly calmed down, but this didn’t mean that her anger was gone, this just meant that she was even more angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Later, no matter what happens, I’m going to deal with her. So infuriating.” Bai Qingqing’s words seemed calm but were filled with cold intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I don’t like her either. She is not as pretty as our Qingqing and comes out to scare people. It’s her fault.” Zhao Jiuge nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side, the corner of Leng Rufeng’s mouth twitched. He didn’t know that Zhao Jiuge would change into a different person beside Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The top of Wu Hua Peak suddenly quiet down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a sound soon broke this silence. Four figures quickly arrived from the bottom. The difference was that they were wearing green sword robes. They were the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak. The three peaks had temporarily gathered, but there were likely more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person taking the lead had a noble temperament, and not even his ordinary, green sword robe could hide it. He had a simple but extraordinary jade token around his waist. This made Zhao Jiuge think about his Pi Xiu Jade Token.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw this person, he was startled. It was actually a Mysterious Fallen Peak disciple he had met before, Luo Bowen.<span id="footnote-ref-0541"><a href="#footnote-0541">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three people behind him were wearing the same clothes and they all had flying swords in their hands. Their imposing appearance made it look like they were determined to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They hadn’t gotten close yet, but they weren’t hiding their cultivation—one at the late stage of the Foundation Realm and three at the mid stage. On the surface, they were the most powerful of the three parties here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, Zhao Jiuge, we meet again. I have to thank you for trading me the herb last time.” As soon as Luo Bowen arrived at the top and saw Zhao Jiuge, he laughed. However, he was carefully observing the situation at the top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how the people from the two peaks seemed to know each other, Zhang Pingquan’s expression became a little ugly. However, after looking at the situation below the peak for a &nbsp;while, she calmed down and crossed her arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was merely a deal, we both got what we wanted.” Zhao Jiuge smiled softly. He didn’t show too much enthusiasm but also wasn’t too cold. Now that all three sides had appeared, the current situation was not clear. Each party had their own hidden intent. It was best not to offend others, but he also couldn’t trust others easily. In addition, although Luo Bowen’s gesture was very friendly, his shrewd eyes exposed his inner thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Zhao Jiuge’s words, Luo Bowen gently smiled but didn’t speak. He observed the people at the peak; he seemed to be waiting for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that those that could reach the top were all top disciples of their respective peaks, and they were at least at the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was thinking nonstop. It looked like the situation was not good. He hadn’t interacted with the remaining two peaks and didn’t know their situation. He thought the other two peaks were similar to the Mysterious Heaven Peak, but it looked like the other two sides were a head above. After all, the Mysterious Heaven Peak only had eight Foundation Realm cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was still calm. After all, when they fought, it wouldn’t depend just on the numbers. Being in the same realm did not mean that their strength was equal. He had his own ace, so he was confident. Not to mention there was also the mysterious Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None of the three sides took the initiative to break the balance. They all had their own hidden intentions and were waiting for their other people to arrive. About half an hour later, a sound came from the distance. Everyone’s gazes moved to the source of the sound—they wanted to see who had arrived. In particular, Zhang Pingquan’s eyes shined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When those figures reached the top, there was a flash of disappointment from Zhang Pingquan’s eyes. She was becoming impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Gang, I thought you had already been dealt with by others and had your flag taken,” Luo Bowen suddenly said, but his tone was not friendly. These two must have had their own conflicts in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I had been dealt with already, then you wouldn’t be able to do much in the battle at the top.” The person leading the way spoke without any care. He was also wearing a green sword robe. His body was burly and he was already growing a beard even though he was only 17 or 18 years old. His untrimmed appearance didn’t look youthful at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen let out a cold snort and didn’t disagree with Chen Gang’s words. The two of them were not close, but there was no great feud between them. Now that they were facing powerful enemies, Luo Bowen secretly felt relieved that Chen Gang was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang also didn’t hide his cultivation—he was at the late stage of the Foundation Realm. Out of the four people behind him, two were at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm and two were at the early stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving at the top, Chen Gang brought his group to Luo Bowen’s side. The two sides joined forces for a total of nine Foundation Realm cultivators, each holding a flying sword in their hand. Without a doubt, at this moment, the Mysterious Fallen Peak was filled with confidence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang didn’t seem to feel the tense atmosphere at the top at all and was constantly talking and laughing with Luo Bowen. However, Luo Bowen didn’t even bother, he would only occasionally nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling somewhat bored, Chen Gang turned toward the other two sides. He sometimes looked at Zhang Pingquan and sometimes at Bai Qingqing. His smile was filled with ill intent and he said, “Guys, which one should I make a move on first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s expressions remained unchanged. However, Zhang Pingquan’s gaze changed a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang felt very satisfied with Zhang Pingquan’s reaction and smiled. However, when he saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s unchanging expressions, he was unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spirit force flickered. He was hesitating on who to attack first, because they held the biggest advantage right now. Although he had his differences with Luo Bowena and they would fight in the end, they had to deal with the disciples of the other two peaks first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan quickly shouted, “Wait, let us work together to deal with the Mysterious Heaven Peak first. The Mysterious Heaven Peak has always occupied the top position. This time, I want to eliminate them first and see how they lose all face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang suddenly raised his brow and unhappily said, “Why should I join forces with you just because you say so? Doesn’t that mean I’m easy to boss around?” However, his tone quickly changed. “But this idea sounds very good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at Luo Bowen and asked, “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen frowned and whispered, “Hmph, you’re on your own. I know him a bit from before, so it's not good for me to join in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the others easily point the spear toward them, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but frown a little. However, he didn’t expect Luo Bowen to be so righteous. It was already very good that he wouldn’t make a move. After all, the two peaks were competing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Chen Gang agree, Zhang Pingquan revealed ill intent in her eyes and coldly smiled. She didn’t know why she didn’t like Bai Qingqing from the moment they met. Perhaps there was some jealousy at play. After all, not only was Bai Qingqing more beautiful, but her strength was similar to hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Chen Gang and Zhang Pingquan were talking to the people on their respective sides about attacking, the situation changed again. There was more sound from the distance. Today’s events were really filled with twists and turns. The tense atmosphere suddenly dissipated and everyone looked at which side’s people had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter who arrived, it would be enough to change the situation at the top!</span></p>
