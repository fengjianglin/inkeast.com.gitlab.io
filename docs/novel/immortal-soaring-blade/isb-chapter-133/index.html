 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Zhao Jiuge wondered why she was here. Back during his fight against the youth with the scar, every inner disciple attracted a lot of attention, but she was the most dazzling. The only difference today was that she was wearing red instead of white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was so frightened that he was trembling. He asked, “Who is this senior?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, direct disciple, Fu Hongling,” the cold woman softly replied. She didn’t even look at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling didn’t even move, but the whisk that was wrapped around Zhao Jiuge instantly broke. A precious treasure had been destroyed just like that. Free from his shackles, Zhao Jiuge felt dizzy and lost control of his body. At this moment, Fu Hongling had already descended and grabbed Zhao Jiuge's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint fragrance entered his nose and he felt something support his shoulder. Zhao Jiuge wanted to stabilize himself, but due to his injuries, he almost fell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling helpless, he could only weakly say, “Senior Sister.” Direct disciple—those simple words allowed Zhao Jiuge to understand her identity. Generally, disciples started as outer disciples for three years and then they have a chance to enter the inner sect. After entering the inner sect, the outstanding disciples would be chosen by some elders or powerful members of the sect to be their own disciples. Those people were the direct disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re very injured, but you won’t stay still. Be quiet and wait until your senior sister gets justice for you. Then we can go home.” As she spoke, anger surged in her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect was Zhao Jiuge’s home. Now that he had encountered a senior sister from his sect, Zhao Jiuge was finally able to relax. Exhaustion overcame his body, and Zhao Jiuge looked like he was wronged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, Senior there is a misunderstanding.” After hearing the words “Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect,” the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was petrified. He originally thought that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was just some small sect nearby. Who knew that a mere disciple from this sect would be able to blade soar? The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was filled with fear. He was trying to think of something, anything to get out of this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery wasn't even in the mood to appreciate the beautiful woman before him. He saw the killing intent in her eyes, and his heart became even more anxious. His body could not move due to the pressure, he could only shout, “This… This… Senior, this Yin Spirit Bead is yours. Please spare my life, Senior.” When he saw her eyes, he knew she intended to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Daoist boy was so terrified by this pressure that he fell to the ground. At this moment, he was so scared, he began crying. “Senior, please spare me. Senior, please spare me. It's all my master’s fault, kill my master. It was all my master’s greed.” As he cried, he tried to make himself look more pathetic. In his heart, he hoped that she would spare him because he was just a child. However, although he was young, he was far too scheming. No matter how good his acting was, the eyes were the window to one’s heart, and he wasn’t able to hide his innermost thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery heard this, he became so angry that he almost coughed out blood, but he was in no mood to discipline his disciple right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one’s own life was in danger, anything could be abandoned. This was human nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling had encountered countless people, so how could she fall for the little Daoist boy’s words? She was too lazy to speak and looked at them in disgust. At this moment, an invisible sword energy directly cut the little Daoist boy into pieces. The strange thing was that there wasn’t a drop of blood anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling could already use sword energy without a sword in her hand. Her heart was the sword, so anything could be a sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… This… What kind of sword is this?” Seeing Fu Hongling kill his disciple instantly, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery felt like someone was holding his throat, and he couldn't speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do I still need to use my sword to kill you? You’re so young, but your mind is already so vicious. It's better to kill you now than to let you plague the world.” Fu Hongling’s eyes were terrifyingly cold to outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for you, no matter what you do, you shouldn’t have schemed against a disciple of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. If it were someone else, I wouldn’t have bothered. You haven’t even cultivated your nascent soul yet, so now you can reincarnate into a better person.” When she was done speaking, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was cut up like his disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Parts of the body were scattered across the ground, but, strangely, there was not a drop of blood. If one examined the wounds carefully, they would see that the cuts seemed to be frozen. This was the effect of refining oneself inside a spirit vein at the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling had only taken an instant to kill two people without even blinking an eye. The Yu family were so frightened that they screamed. Fu Hongling looked at them like she was looking at ants and then no longer paid any attention to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once your cultivation level was high above others, your gaze toward mortals would be filled with indifference. Just like how the woman named Bo Re had looked at Zhao Jiuge back at the cold pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took out a fiery-red shuttle, and it instantly covered the disciple and teacher in flames. The fire burned until nothing remained—it was as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After doing all of this, Fu Hongling looked at where the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was and muttered, “To cultivate, one must cultivate oneself, and to cultivate oneself, one must cultivate one’s heart. If you can’t even maintain your heart, then there is no point in cultivating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling Zhao Jiuge move under her left arm, Fu Hongling looked down at the youth that only came up to her chest. She said in an educational tone, “These words are for you too. If you can’t even maintain your heart, then there is no point in cultivating. On the path of cultivation, you will inevitably encounter all kinds of temptation, greed, fear, and other emotions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She paused for a moment and then gently said, “But your performance was very good.” Her voice was filled with admiration and there was joy in her eyes. In the end, he would’ve died rather than reveal the sword art—Fu Hongling felt that this was already very good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was startled. At this moment, Fu Hongling was not completely emotionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go, Senior Sister will take you home.” After she finished speaking, the red flying sword descended from the sky. Fu Hongling took Zhao Jiuge onto the flying sword and flew across the night sky. They gradually disappeared into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bright light gradually disappeared along with words of the two people talking. After determining that they were completely gone, the people of the Yu family stood up. Yu Qingshan knew that the Yu family had missed out on a great opportunity tonight. At this moment, everyone had their own thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the flying sword, Zhao Jiuge heard the sound of wind. Although his head was a bit dizzy, he couldn’t help but look up. He curiously looked at Fu Hongling and asked, “Senior Sister, have you been here the whole time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhmm.” Fu Hongling looked into the distance. In truth, she had been following Zhao Jiuge ever since he received his mission. When the Three-Tailed Yin Cat appeared, she wanted to make a move. However, when she saw his determined gaze, she gave up the idea. Finally, Zhao Jiuge unintentionally broke through to the Foundation Realm and killed the Three-Tailed Yin Cat. Then the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was overtaken by greed and threatened Zhao Jiuge. At that point, she still didn’t make a move, she simply observed Zhao Jiuge. Only at the last moment did she finally make her move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This all proved that although Zhao Jiuge’s talent was average, his potential was good. The fact that he was able to make a breakthrough at a moment of crisis was proof. Most importantly, Fu Hongling could not find a problem with Zhao Jiuge’s character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling &nbsp;had always cultivated inside the sect, and after cultivating for so long, she had become a bit bored. Her master had also said to pay some attention to Zhao Jiuge’s character, and that girl Sha Sha constantly talked about this boy. This made her curious, so she had decided to come out for a walk and follow Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling thought that if Zhao Jiuge could perform well in the inner disciple selection and his cultivation continued at this rate, he would likely become her junior disciple. However, there was over a year left, and who knew how the future would turn out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, can I ask if you have cultivated your nascent soul yet?” Zhao Jiuge asked like he was a curious baby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The most important thing for you is to cultivate, don’t look too far. I have cultivated my nascent soul. If you work hard, you can as well,” Fu Hongling patiently explained. Acting like this was against her nature. Normally, she would never speak this much in one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, Sensior Sister, is it true that once I reach the Foundation Realm, I can blade soar for a short period of time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, when the time comes, can you teach me how to blade soar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, how long until we arrive? I feel dizzy and ill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, I’m so tired. Can I sleep now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Sister, what if I fall down once I fall asleep?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Might as well fall to your death.” Zhao Jiuge chattered nonstop. Fu Hongling was normally very reserved, so it was heaven-shattering for her to speak this much. Finally, she was simply too annoyed by Zhao Jiuge and became a bit angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, Zhao Jiuge immediately shut up because it was boring to talk by himself. Slowly, his fatigue caught up and he fell asleep leaning against Fu Hongling’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the pressure on her chest, Fu Hongling wanted to push Zhao Jiuge away. She had interacted with very few people over the years, not to mention being touched in such an indecent posture. However, when she saw Zhao Jiuge’s childish face and his injuries, her heart softened. She gave up on the idea of pushing him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge had fallen asleep due to fatigue, so no one saw Fu Hongling’s face turn red. She then revealed a helpless smile and shook her head while looking at the youth that might become her junior brother one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yu family’s ancestral home was not far from the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, so it only took a few hours to arrive. Fu Hongling steered her flying sword past the Mysterious Heaven Peak and continued east. The flying sword circled around a smaller peak, Lotus Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an unknown amount of time, Zhao Jiuge opened his eyes. Fu Hongling was sitting next to him, cultivating with her eyes closed. When she detected Zhao Jiuge waking up, she also opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fu Hongling softly said, “Awake? Since you’re awake, you better hurry up and cultivate to adjust your condition to the peak. Then you can enter a spirit vein to refine your body. Right now, your meridians are damaged, and you need to slowly recover by cultivating. Don’t go anywhere for the next few days, just stay here and focus on recovering.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Fu Hongling’s words, Zhao Jiuge was startled and looked around. He was attracted by the scenery of this mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he was lying on a large patch of spirit grass with a few spirit cranes lazily lying around. Not far away, there was a large patch of herbs. What he could see was already so beautiful, and who knew what other beautiful scenery could be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge exclaimed with envy, “Senior Sister, is this large mountain peak all yours?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes this Lotus Peak belongs to me. Work hard and maybe you will have your own peak someday.” Fu Hongline looked at Zhao Jiuge meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked around for a moment and then weakly said, “Senior Sister, can we discuss something?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speak.” Fu Hongling still didn’t like to talk much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can we not go to the spirit vein right now? You promised to teach me how to blade soar.” Zhao Jiuge was, after all, still a child, and all he could think about was learning how to blade soar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Hu Fengling’s cold expression, Zhao Jiuge muttered, “It doesn’t matter if I refine my body in the spirit vein later, it doesn’t affect anything.” After breaking through to the Foundation Realm, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t wait to experience blade soaring himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cultivation is important. Once you are strong enough, you will naturally be able to blade soar.” Fu Hongling was getting a bit of a headache. She didn’t know how to deal with this, so she pretended to scold him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s voice suddenly became even smaller—he felt wronged. “You promised me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Fu Hongling’s heart soften, so she helplessly said, “Even if you want to blade soar, you must have the spirit force first. First recover your spirit force, then I’ll teach you.” Looking at the naughty youth, Fu Hongling thought back to when she reached the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After getting Fu Hongling’s answer, Zhao Jiuge cheerfully got up and took out something from this storage ring to prepare to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was getting ready to cultivate, Zhao Jiuge still had a big smile on his face. He was fantasizing about when he could blade soar on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Lotus Peak, a youth and a beautiful woman cultivated on their own. Each had their own thoughts. Occasionally, the sounds of cranes and birds accompanied them.</span></p>
