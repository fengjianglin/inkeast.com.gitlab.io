 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he successfully cultivated the Sanskrit Divine Body at the Blood Movement Realm. there was only a layer of golden light around him. It wasn’t until he was on the stairs that the image of a buddha appeared around his body due to external pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, Zhao Jiuge had only taken a quick glance and the feeling was not that strong. He only felt that the Sanskrit Divine Body was not simple, but he didn’t think too much about it. However, when he was hit by the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, he was only sent flying a few meters and the aura in his body became a bit unstable. He felt a bit of pain, but the golden light around him didn’t break like he thought it would. Instead, the laughing buddha appeared around him again, and since he had broken through to the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, it was even more solidified than before. He felt it much more clearly this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhao Jiuge lied on the ground, he couldn’t help but think about the past. Whether it was the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder or Daoist Yi Qing, whenever he faced danger, the buddha in his dantain would slightly open its closed eyes. At first he thought it was just an illusion, but now he knew that the Sanskrit Divine Body was not as simple as it appeared. From when he cultivated the Sanskrit Divine Body at the Blood Movement Realm, to forming his first golden dragon, to the appearance of the buddha, Zhao Jiuge guessed that every realm he reached would bring about a change to the Sanskrit Divine Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Zhao Jiuge was secretly feeling shocked, Bai Qingqing, who was prepared to use a spell she had learned in her youth, couldn’t help but look at the phenomenon that had appeared around Zhao Jiuge. Her pretty face lost all color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She originally thought that the strength Zhao Jiuge had shown on the stairs was very mysterious. That was why she became curious and wanted to know the secrets behind his spell. They had just come out to gather some herbs, but she was able to see it again. This time was even more shocking than before. The extraordinary pressure it gave off gave her a vague sense of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The buddha avatar surrounded Zhao Jiuge tightly and gave off a peaceful aura. This caused Bai Qingqing’s nervous heart to calm down just by looking at it. There was a faint fragrance around the avatar, and petals started falling down like a waterfall around Zhao Jiuge’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf let out a low roar. Seeing this scene, it sensed danger and didn’t immediately charge forward. The bloodthirst in its large eyes lessened and was replaced with some vigilance. It had gained some intelligence when it reached the Foundation Realm. After it made a breakthrough and formed its spirit core, it would be able to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its claws gently grinded on the ground and its chest stopped heaving as much. It began breathing slowly, and a drop of saliva fell from the corner of its mouth from time to time. Zhao Jiuge had been going into the mountains to hunt since he was a child, so he knew the wolf was preparing to attack again. He quickly rolled and jumped up with a worried gaze. His brows furrowed and he shouted, “Be careful, it’s about to attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing immediately recovered and her hands began moving once more. After seeing that Zhao Jiuge was fine, she relaxed and put aside all the distracting thoughts in her mind. She decided to deal with this annoying fellow first before questioning Zhao Jiuge to satisfy her inner curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Qingqing moved, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf also moved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hair on the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf suddenly stood up as if it was facing a powerful enemy. The wolf opened its mouth and relied on its instinct to spit out multiple mouthfuls of spirit force. The wolf spit out seven or eight attacks. They were like wind blades, and not only were they thin, they were also very fast. Spirit beasts couldn’t use spells like humans. Only after reaching the Nascent Realm and transforming into human form could they begin learning spells. Before that, they could only rely on their instinct and spirit force to attack. After seeing the phenomenon created by Zhao Jiuge, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was no longer careless. It attacked in full force and no longer held back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing was caught somewhat off guard, so she quickly created pink shields to defend against the blue wind blades. Seven or eight palm-sized shields matched the wind blades exactly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterward, without even looking at the results, there was a flash of spirit light before Bai Qingqing’s chest. A sword that was three fingers wide and over a meter long appeared in front of her! It was a flying sword! Not one formed by her spirit force, but an actual flying sword. The entire flying sword shined silver, and there was a shallow groove in the middle of the sword’s body. The sides of the sword contained carvings of silver and blue snowflakes, and there were two simple yet imposing words carved on the hilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wind Flower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before coming here, Bai Qingqing’s father was worried that she would be bullied at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Therefore, not only did he bestow a lot of powerful magic treasures to her, he also gave her this flying sword that he had refined himself. She had disliked the spirit wolf from the beginning, and now she could no longer contain her anger. A woman’s fury was more fierce than a tiger! So she finally took out her Wind Flower Sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was about to rush over, but his eyes widened when he saw the flying sword. Then he could clearly hear himself swallow. He had only sensed these kinds of fluctuations from Su Su before. These fluctuations were very similar to her hairpin—it was another spirit weapon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he looked at himself. Aside from the wooden sword given to him by the sect before this mission and the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd, there was nothing he could use. It was no wonder Bai Qingqing was so generous when she talked about giving him the 100 sect contributions. When he was still working hard to forge a common flying sword, she already had a spirit treasure. The Wind Flower Sword before Bai Qingqing didn’t even have spirit force injected into it yet, but there were ripples around it as if the space around it was distorting. Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with passion. The sharpness of that sword was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of sounds echoed in succession. If one didn’t listen carefully, one would think there was only one sound. The cyan aura collided with the pink shield, causing the pink shield to shatter when they collided. The cyan aura from the wolf held the upper hand and broke through the shield. However, it had been weakened considerably and was no longer a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort while holding the Wind Flower Sword, and even her eyes became cold. She casually swung the sword and sent out a ray of sword light that flew toward the wolf. Even though she had a spirit treasure in her hand, she could not use its power with her cultivation level. She could only rely on the natural power of the spirit treasure. Moreover, Bai Qingqing had barely even begun learning the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the flying sword in hand, Bai Qingqing didn’t care about much as she frantically waved it. With her cultivation at the late stage of Spirit Transformation, the sword lights created were extraordinary. The sword lights condensed into one large ray that was several meters long and flew forward with a sharpness that could split the air. The air around it distorted and an invisible pressure closed in on the wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing completely released her cultivation, causing her long, silk hair to flutter without any wind. She was wearing the blue sword robe and holding the extremely sharp sword. At the same time, she looked a bit less alluring but more heroic. She was clenching her teeth and her brows were furrowed—it was clear how much she hated the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking advantage of this moment, Zhao Jiuge didn’t wait for the result. He condensed a long sword in his hand with his spirit force. The Sanskrit Divine Body surrounded him and he leaped toward the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf like the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf let out two howls. Seeing their movements, it felt disturbed. Originally, it only smelled two spirit forces and had come here to find easy prey, but it didn’t expect to be caught in this dilemma. Now it exposed its fierce aura completely and bared its fangs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the bloodthirsty nature of the spirit beast was exposed. Not only did it not dodge the powerful sword light, it actually rushed into it desperately. At the same time, its own spirit force erupted from its body. The two attacks were about to land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first to collide were the claws and the sword light. There was no violent eruption like a rushing river—it was like a gentle stream with hidden killing intent instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword light was cold and the claws were sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a muffled sound and the wolf’s claws tore the sword light open. The sword light that was torn in two flew off and collided with the surrounding trees and the face of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than a dozen trees were chopped at the base and leaves flew everywhere, shocking the birds and the insects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the rock face of the mountain was an imprint more than three meters deep and two fingers wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This shocked Zhao Jiuge greatly when he saw this following the sword light. This was just the lowly Spirit Transformation Realm, but it could already output such great power just by relying on spirit force. In that case, once his cultivation became stronger, would he be able to move mountains, fill oceans, and produce clouds and rain with a wave of his hand?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was even stronger. Even though the spirit beast’s body was stronger than a human’s, the fact that it had managed to tear open the sword light with its claws was frightening. If it was just Zhao Jiuge encountering the wolf today, he would have probably run away scared while activating the talisman in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, afterward, Zhao Jiuge found that the wolf didn’t have it good either. Blood stains appeared on its sharp claws and its body ached. A miserable howl echoed through the night. This completely broke the originally silent atmosphere of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger were scurrying through the mountains, looking for the seven herbs in their memories. So far, they had found nothing. They had no experience with this at all, so they had been moving around like headless flies from the moment they entered the mountains. They had gone deep into the mountains with no sense of direction at all and then a miserable scream suddenly came from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was panic on Liu Yinger’s face and her entire body trembled. She lowered her head and looked toward the direction of the sound. “Big Brother Baiwan, there shouldn’t be any dangerous things in this mountain, right?”</span></p>
