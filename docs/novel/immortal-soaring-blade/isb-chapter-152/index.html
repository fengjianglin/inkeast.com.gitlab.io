 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fallen Leaf Mountain’s peak was a large, flat area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were seven or eight people at the edge of the peak looking at something. They were all holding various treasures in their hands, and from their smiles, one could tell that they were not good people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother, do you think those two little fellows can break out of the illusion formation? They have been walking around in circles for a long time, I’m laughing to death,” a short fat man said to Zhang Long, who was sitting in the middle. The people inside could not see outside the illusion formation, but the people outside could see inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man in black called Zhang Long was tall and thin. At this moment, he had an unhappy expression. “I told you to stop calling me ‘Big Brother.’ If the Mountain Lord hears this, I’ll be scolded again.” Although Zhang Long said this, there was a pleased smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, there is no way that little fellow can come out. Without the Mountain Lord’s control, no one can get out.” Speaking of the Mountain Lord Han Songcheng, Zhang Long had a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, he was someone who wandered around Yellow Flower Ridge. To be more precise, he was someone who killed, robbed, and did other unsavory business. The person who just spoke and was holding the big, golden blade was his right hand man, Fat Dragon. Originally, he led this group and robbed people without any problems. Who knew that 20 years ago, they would meet a man with an extraordinary temperament carrying a longsword. He led his group to attack, but they didn’t even see what the man did before they were all beaten to the ground. When he saw the sword fly on its own, he was so scared that he knelt down and begged for mercy. He had never seen immortal spells like this before. The man named Han Songcheng didn’t go hard on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had only asked if they were willing to follow him, and he would even teach them those shocking immortal spells. He was just a mortal back then, and not only had he survived a crisis, he could also learn immortal spells like he had always dreamed of. They immediately kowtowed to Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like this, they followed Han Songcheng and did many unsavory things in the area. Not only was their cultivation improving with Han Songcheng’s teaching, even Han Songcheng had managed to break through to the late stage of the Foundation Realm and get rid of the old daoist who kept hindering them. Afterward, this group of people became completely unhinged and became the kings of Yellow Flower Ridge. When their strength increased, they killed cultivators that passed by, taking their possessions. Like a snowball, their forces grew bigger and bigger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to their strength, they had never suffered any losses. Then Han Songcheng pulled in the surrounding rogue cultivators. Those that followed him were rewarded greatly with some of the stolen treasures. Although they were just magic treasures, they were already very good for these cultivators. For those that didn’t want to follow him, Han Songcheng used his power to bully them into surrendering. If they still weren’t willing, he would kill them. Some of them simply left Yellow Flower Ridge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s reputation gradually spread across the area, and people even came to join him. Vulture was a typical example of this. Aside from Vulture, there were five or six more who joined Han Songcheng, but they were not as strong as Vulture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These seven or eight people were the core raised by Han Songcheng and were favored by him, unlike the other rogue cultivators. This had made Zhang Long very satisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that Zhang Long never thought about dealing with Han Songcheng. After all, even though Han Songcheng had always treated him well, he had lost his position as the boss and had to work under someone else. After so many years, as his strength increased, it wasn’t that he had never considered taking some of his underlings and leaving, but after he saw Han Songcheng’s power and methods, he completely gave up on the idea. He wasn’t sure how many aces Han Songcheng had saved up. Every time they robbed something, Han Songcheng would have the first pick and then would pass the rest to him as a reward. This illusion formation was something Han Songcheng had stolen from a young cultivation a few years ago. It was only recently that he had set it up to protect his nest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, the sword diagram Han Songcheng had casually given to him as a reward was extremely profound, yet Han Songcheng had just casually gifted it to him. He might even have a chance to use this sword diagram today. Zhang Long felt respect, fear, and hatred towards Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long recovered his thoughts after a long time. He looked into the bamboo forest and watched the two people that had stopped circling around and were now standing there, thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding the quaint, golden blade and revealing his fat chest, Fat Dragon crooked his head and said with a face filled with admiration, “The Mountain Lord’s methods sure are powerful and mysterious. The sword diagram he rewarded us to practice is also very mysterious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at his former subordinates who now all looked at Han Songcheng in awe, each of them had succumbed to Han Songcheng. Zhang Long suddenly felt a burst of sorrow in his heart. Although he thought of others like this, wasn’t he exactly the same as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he didn’t have the strength to take the lead, then he better do his job well. Zhang Long was still very satisfied compared to before. The difference was that before, he would issue the orders, but now he had to listen to someone else’s orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about this, his previously relaxed expression disappeared and was replaced with a gloomy and serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Fat Dragon’s words, a man as skinny as Zhang Long but much shorter let out a lecherous chuckle. He swallowed and his eyes were filled with passion. “That little girl inside the bamboo forest sure is pretty. I have never seen a woman with an appearance and temperament like that. I’m willing to lose a few years of my life to spend the night with her. What’s the saying? When you die under the skirt of a beautiful woman, you are popular even as a ghost.” After he finished speaking, the people around him laughed. This was a laugh all men would understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who had spoken was Cheng Jinqian. He had an honest face, but his words exposed his true nature. Before he met Han Songcheng, he was the tactician of the group. He had come up with a lot of terrible plans, and his belly was filled with nastiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon seemed to feel a bit of disdain and sneered. “Dream on. Someone with your looks wants to be together with her? You even got the poem wrong. You should take a piss and see your own reflection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon’s words suddenly attracted the ridicule of others. Cheng Jinqian felt like he was losing face and was about to argue back. At this moment, Zhang Long, who was in a serious mood, felt like this noise was really annoying and erupted in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, shut up and stop quarreling. The Mountain Lord had commanded us to stay here and stall them in case they break out. This girl is someone the Mountain Lord wants, and you dare to have ideas about her? Do you want to die? Careful, or else the Mountain Lord won’t even let you become a ghost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long’s words caused his surrounding subordinates to shiver. They seemed to remember Han Songcheng’s methods. They all shut up and looked seriously at the scene inside the bamboo forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long seemed to be very satisfied with the response. Seeing all his subordinates become quiet, he sternly said, “Pay attention. Although this illusion formation is strong, they might come out at any time. At that time, it's our job to stall them. The Mountain Lord said that we have to do whatever it takes to stall them here. Just a while ago, the Mountain Lord rewarded us with the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram, it's time to test its power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Zhang Long touched the jade tube near his chest. The Eight Desolate Sword Diagram was recorded inside. He didn’t have a storage ring, so he had to keep precious items on him. When Zhang Long touched the cold, jade tube, his heart burned with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then everyone became silent and the atmosphere became quiet. Fat Dragon seemed to be unable to stand the atmosphere as he looked back at the courtyard on the mountain peak. He secretly muttered to Zhang Long, “Big Brother, I see that Luo Xuqing brought his people out as well. I presume the Mountain Lord ordered him out as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind them was a large courtyard, which was where they lived. The innermost residence was where Han Songcheng lived, and no one could enter except him. At this moment, he quickly fled back with Vulture and was recovering their spirit force. He had sent out all his subordinates to stall for time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who cares about them? It’s good that they came out. Then there will be a chance for them to see how great we are. After all, I heard the Mountain Lord only gave us the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram and not them.” Zhang Long smiled. There was a bit of pride in his eyes.</span></p>
