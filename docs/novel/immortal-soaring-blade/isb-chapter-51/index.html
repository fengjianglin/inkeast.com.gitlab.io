 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Mu Zijun’s arrival, Liu Yinger spoke a lot more and her smile was even sweeter. Seeing this, Luo Xie’s lecherous heart could not stand it any more, but Zhao Jiuge noticed that while others were paying attention, Mu Zijun was observing them. This did not match the smile on his face, which made Zhao Jiuge feel that Mu Zijun was not a simple person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While everyone was talking, seven or eight more people came to the third floor. The most eye-catching one was a young girl with a beautiful body wearing very revealing clothes. She had a charming face that had a lot of allure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made it so Luo Xie couldn’t help but stare at her. However, the people that came later didn’t come up to talk, they just silently waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time slowly passed, and the noise from the square outside became quieter and quieter. Gradually, the crowd outside began to disperse. Some did not meet the conditions to enter, or were not qualified. Some laughed and some felt sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reluctant people went to other sects to try to enter, and those that were not qualified were complaining in the square. The sun began to set and the light shone on the square, shining on everyone’s joy and sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roof of the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ordinary-looking, black-robed middle-aged man and Wu Tianshan still stood there. The two of them watching the rapidly setting sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Uncle, the recruitment is about to end. I don’t know how many new disciples our Mysterious Heaven Peak faction will have. The head teacher position has always been passed down to our Mysterious Heaven Peak, but now that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect has fallen, the Mysterious Strange Peak and the Mysterious Fallen Peak use this to say that it was Master who led the sect into this position. They placed all the blame on Master,” Wu Tianshan said with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-robed middle-aged man’s eyes squinted and he silently pondered for a bit. No one knew what he was thinking. After a while, he said, “When the ancestor ascended to immortality, he set down the rules, leaving three factions that complement each other. My Mysterious Heaven Peak is the lead, while the two other peaks are our support. Now they are delusional and want to seize power—how is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, the middle-aged man’s slightly squinted eyes shined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I took a look and there were a few with pretty good bones today. After going through the outer sect test, they should enter the inner sect without much problems. Then, with some more training, it'll be time to kill those two factions’ prestige a bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words were very steady, but each word revealed his cold intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the yellow-robed Wu Tianshan had a bit of worry on his face as he scanned the scattered people on the square. “Ah, we have great enemies on the outside and we face chaos internally. Everything will depend on this batch of disciples. In 10 years, the gathering of the various sects will take place. I guess that will be the turning point.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hall on the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time went by, the light from the sunset spilled through the flower pattern on the window and entered the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all have waited a long time. You should have rested enough. Come gather in the square outside.” A youth disciple in blue suddenly appeared on the third floor. When he spoke, he shocked everyone as no one even felt his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was secretly shocked and thought that if even an ordinary disciple was like this, this sect was indeed worthy of being one of the holy lands. Although he had heard that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had fallen, even a starved camel was larger than a horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything he had encountered since he found the legacy from Ye Wuyou and inadvertently stepped onto the path of cultivation was inconsequential. Aside from Grandpa Yang, the strongest person he had met was only at the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be said that the first three realms were just laying the foundation for the Foundation Realm, and the Foundation Realm was where cultivation truly began. It was like building a house—you would first have to dig a hole and then lay the foundation. Only after the foundation was set could you build on top. The more solid the foundation, the higher you could build and the further you could go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing the young disciple wearing the blue sword robe with the silver swords embroidered on the cuffs, Zhao Jiuge thought about how he would be the same soon. He could not help but feel the blood inside his body boil with expectation and excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his entire body seemed to give off a certain kind of aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It's finally time. I've been sitting for so long that my butt is about to fall asleep.” Wang Baiwan immediately stood up, and the fat on his body jiggled. Zhao Jiuge looked at Wang Baiwan and then at the wooden chair. He felt bad for the chair to have to withstand so much pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the order from the young disciple, the expressions of the 20 or so people here changed. After speaking, the disciple went downstairs and disappeared without a trace. Everyone seemed to have seen enough strange things to not care and went down to the square one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s eyes shined and he took a deep breath before he followed everyone downstairs. When he got down to the second floor, he found that it was already empty. He guessed they had already gone downstairs ahead of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he stepped out the door, what Zhao Jiuge saw outside completely shocked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw more than 200 young boys and girls wearing clothes of different colors on the blue stone brick square, looking into the distance. The sunset seemed to be witnessing this moment and refusing to set.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bright, golden light filled the square and formed an outline around everyone. Their shadows were stretched very long. They were all standing in neat and orderly lines when they suddenly noticed a few middle-aged men wearing sword robes and a dozen or so disciples in blue sword robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The noisy square gradually became quiet until everyone was completely silent. Everyone quietly observed the group of middle-aged men standing there, and for a while, the entire square was particularly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged men wearing sword robes didn’t speak. Their gazes were like sharp swords that swept back and forth through the crowd. Whenever their gazes locked on to someone, that person would feel unnatural, straighten their body, and even find it difficult to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge only felt that when one of the middle-aged men looked at him, he felt actual sword intent. It contained the spirit of a sword and an unimaginable aura. It felt similar to when he looked at those paintings on the wall, but those were not as intense as the gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the roof, the two figures were still standing there. All of the youths began to stand up straight, creating a youthful aura that began to slowly overflow from the square. The middle-aged man in the black robe finally stopped looking into the distance and his gaze gently swifted down to the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was completely silent down there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then an oppressive and tense atmosphere began to build, causing everyone to unconsciously tighten every part of their bodies. An aura began to slowly gather, and with the sunset as the backdrop, it was a spectacular sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, they finally look a bit proper.” He let out a cold snort and only took a glance before he withdrew his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Tianshan looked at the spectacular scene on the square, a faint smile appeared. His thoughts drifted back to his own youth, to the day when he was about to join the sect. Wasn’t he also like them, eyes filled with expectation and fantasies of the future? At the same time, he had strengthened the resolve in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as the times changed, these kinds of ideals and insights would fade—they would be replaced with lost hearts. After one step, the next step would be even more difficult. That was why when some cultivators get stuck, they just simply begin to enjoy themselves. They would even do things such as adultery, abuse, and all sorts of evil things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there was no hope, there would be no disappointment. Who wants to be evil? However many people’s personality became twisted after it became obvious they could no longer advance, and this made them do all those evil deeds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about this, being young was certainly good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at these young and naive faces, perhaps a few of them would later enter the inner sect and become his juniors. Being affected by the mood, even his worries lessened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder how many will be able to enter the Mysterious Heaven Mountain Faction.” Wu Tianshan’s eyes were filled with expectation as he excitedly looked at the figures below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let fate decide.” The words were cold, concise, and clear. It was as if he wasn’t willing to say even one more word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at his martial uncle before him, Wu Tianshan couldn’t help but sigh inside. His martial uncle was such a dazzling figure until 100 years ago, when an accident happened. This martial uncle’s dao partner had fallen to the schemes of an evil cultivator and died. After that day, his martial uncle’s personality changed greatly, becoming a lot colder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From then on, he also hated all evil cultivators and would kill those people on sight. From then on, the cultivation world knew of a madman from the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect—people nicknamed him the Mysterious Heaven Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than ten minutes had passed, and the crowd on the square were still standing there like that. Their hearts became restless, but at the same time, no one dared to take the lead to break this silence, because the atmosphere was so powerful.

However, I’m going to tell you that being able to enter this building does not mean you can become part of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, and becoming a member of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect doesn’t mean you can enter the inner sect to cultivate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This simple sentence triggered a sudden uproar across the square.</span></p>
