 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them were trembling. Wang Baiwan was merely frightened by Liu Yinger, while Liu Yinger was panicking due to that scream, causing her to think too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That caused her to question Wang Baiwan, which ended up scaring both of them. People scaring each other could scare someone to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger’s originally scared face suddenly smiled like a flower as she watched Wang Baiwan’s shivering expression. She didn’t expect the usually proud Wang Baiwan to have such a timid side. This funny scene diluted her fear and turned it into joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Liu Yinger’s charming smile, Wang Baiwan felt a bit unbearable. A man could not lose his face like this before a woman. His chubby face was a bit fierce and unnatural as he stammered, “Don’t worry, if there is something dangerous here, it will be fine with your Big Brother Baiwan here. I’ll destroy whatever comes our way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While saving his face, he also pretended to be brave and straightened his chest. His fat palm clapped his chest boldly and he pretended to be relaxed. However, seeing no response from Liu Yinger, he felt that what he had said was a bit unconvincing, so he quickly added another line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was just frightened by your sudden shout. As a big man, how could I be scared by such things? Besides, I am still at the Spirit Transformation Realm, okay?” After he finished speaking, he felt a bit guilty and secretly peeked at Liu Yinger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I believe you, Big Brother Baiwan.” Liu Yinger nodded as if she was on board, but the smile on her face betrayed her thoughts. The first impression she had of Wang Baiwan had stuck, and no matter what he said, he couldn’t change it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Men can’t explain themselves. When you try to explain, it means you’re trying to cover it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan helplessly pouted and felt helpless. The aura he deliberately exuded loosened and his back slumped. He hesitated and then said, “Should we go over there to take a look to see what it is? I’m a bit curious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan realized that it was pointless to explain, and in order to restore his image, he decided to head into danger. Moreover, Wang Baiwan had thought about this before. There couldn’t be too much danger here, as the formation was active, not to mention the instructors were probably observing the situation. If he really encountered something he couldn’t deal with, he could always use the talisman. Before he came here, his father had given him a few treasures, so there should be no life-threatening danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger’s eyes widened as she cutely stared at Wang Baiwan as if she wanted to see flowers on his face. However, what Wang Baiwan didn’t expect was to see Liu Yinger nodding in agreement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This suddenly forced Wang Baiwan, who wanted to retreat, to have no choice but to endure himself to head toward the source of the sound. Liu Yinger was also very cautious as she held tightly onto Wang Baiwan’s clothes. Her little head cutely looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the foot of the mountain face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf tore open the sword light Bai Qingqing had sent out, but its claws were also injured. No matter how strong its body was, it could not withstand the sharpness of the flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tearing the sword light with one paw, the cyan spirit force wind blade fell down like rain, but at this moment, Zhao Jiuge closed in. He raised his left hand before his chest and formed a fist. His index and middle fingers stretched out to form a sword. The long sword formed by his spirit force was in his right hand at a 45 degree angle, with the tip of the sword pointed at the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phenomenon created by the Sanskrit Divine Body seemed to change. Zhao Jiuge didn’t know if it was for real or if it was just a psychological effect. He felt a sense of power, and the ferocious aura from the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was no longer as oppressive. At the same time, Zhao Jiuge felt confidence in battling against the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the confidence that strength brought to a person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a mere breath, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes narrowed before they became extremely cold and a fierce aura erupted! He raised his right hand and retracted his elbow before he stabbed toward the cyan spirit force without faltering. Even when faced with the wolf’s powerful spirit force, Zhao Jiuge swung his sword without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a collision of pure spirit force, but how could Zhao Jiuge, who was at the Spirit Transformation Realm have spirit force as powerful as that of the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, who was at the Foundation Realm? The sword formed by his spirit force immediately shattered into specks of light. Although the cyan spirit force from the wolf had been weakened greatly, it still charged at him. It was like a foul and bloody-smelling tornado that rushed toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leaves shook because of the spirit force fluctuations, and they seemed like they were going to disintegrate. All the flowers and plants on the ground immediately withered when the spirit force passed by. The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf’s spirit force contained a corrosive attribute!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When humans cultivated, they had to reach the Spirit Core Realm before they could use spirit veins to obtain extra attributes for their spirit force. However, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was only at the Foundation Realm, yet his spirit force already had a special attribute!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Zhao Jiuge saw all of this, he was not as worried as before. With the mentality that when enemies meet on the narrow path, the stronger will win, he simply relied on his body and raised his palm. Then he viciously smashed down on the cyan spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cyan spirit force collided with the laughing buddha avatar that was enveloping Zhao Jiuge’s body. It created a hoarse sound similar to the sound of someone throwing a handful of fine sand onto the surface of a lake. Ripples spread through the golden light around Zhao Jiuge’s body and then the cyan spirit force disappeared. However, the phenomenon condensed by the Sanskrit Divine Body was perfectly fine. The sitting laughing buddha had a peaceful and kind smile—it was as stable as Mount Tai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was not one to forgive a person. To be more accurate, he was not one to forgive a wolf. Borrowing the force from the slam, he slightly raised his right foot and slammed down into the ground. Copying the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf’s movement, he jumped into the air and condensed his spirit force. As he did so, his fingers spread out. His Sanskrit Divine Body was reaching its peak, and he mercilessly smashed down on the wolf’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s aura was the strongest it had ever been. His aura at only the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm was completely suppressing the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, who was at the Foundation Realm. However, this was somewhat false because the wolf had already been injured by Bai Qingqing’s sword light earlier. At this moment, it was like a bird startled by the mere twang of a bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf looked at Zhao Jiuge’s palm, and there was a sense of panic in its bloodthirsty eyes. It subconsciously raised its uninjured left paw and swiped toward Zhao Jiuge’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp wolf claws created a cold ray of silver light in the night. Although Zhao Jiuge’s palm looked slow, it felt sturdy and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wolf claws were like knives, while the palm was like water. The wolf and human watched in anticipation before they finally collided. However, wolves were cruel and cunning by nature. When they got close, Zhao Jiuge discovered an invisible smile hidden in the wolf’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the moment of contact, the wolf’s eyes suddenly changed and a powerful light erupted from where the claws and the palm collided, creating an invisible wave of spirit force that spread out in all directions. The leaves that had just calmed down were distrubed again by an invisible hand, and everything changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge staggered back a few steps. The phenomenon that had appeared around him remained intact, but the spirit force inside his body was almost empty, with not much left. The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf’s giant body was also knocked back. It used its claws to grab the ground to stop its body, leaving behind marks several meters long on the ground. This showed how strong that collision was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hidden cunning smile in the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf’s eyes suddenly disappeared and it decisively kicked with its back legs. It twisted its body and began running. Unexpectedly, it was trying to escape. The power Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing had displayed made the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf give up on hunting, as its life would be in danger if it stayed. Due to reaching the Foundation Realm, it had a certain level of intelligence. When it sensed danger, it turned and left without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was a pity that it was far too late. How could the raging Bai Qingqing let go of the opportunity to attack the wolf while it was weakened?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had already been waiting for a long time. She began to mutter something before throwing the sword in her right hand. The Wind Flower Sword broke through the air resistance as it flew toward the wolf like a meteor. As the Wind Flower Sword flew through the air, cracks appeared in the space around the tip of the sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Zhao Jiuge’s mouth twitched nonstop. Other people used sword arts to send their flying swords out, but Bai Qingqing had just thrown the valuable spirit treasure like that. When a woman was angry, she was really terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling a piercing pain on its back, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf violently turned around and saw the light flying toward it. The light became larger and larger in its eyes before horror appeared in its face. The next moment, the Wind Flower Sword pierced its head, and the wolf’s aura suddenly wilted as it fell to the ground. It twitched a bit before it laid motionless and its aura completely faded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Foundation Realm Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf had died just like that. Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge felt melancholy. Even though the Sanskrit Divine Body was strong, his own strength was lacking. His spirit force wasn’t strong enough to use any powerful spells, and if he had encountered the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf on his own, the result would’ve been unknown. It was good to have a powerful family, and magic treasures could enhance one’s strength a lot.</span></p>
