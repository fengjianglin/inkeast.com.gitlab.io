 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the sun rose the next day, the entire mountain was bathed in sunlight, giving a golden coat to the entire forest. A monkey and a youth walked out of the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he felt that absorbing spiritual energy was too slow, he was not discouraged, so he continued to cultivate daily. His experiences from earlier in his childhood had molded him into the person he was today. He believed that even dripping water could pierce rock and that an iron rod could be grinded into a needle. He firmly believed that as long as he persevered, he would shine one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Black jumped around the trees nearby. Every branch he jumped on would become a mess. Zhao Jiuge leisurely walked through the forest, thinking about the power of his physical body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yesterday, when he gathered his spirit force inside his palm, he was able to shatter a rock. The blood in his body was almost all covered in spirit force. He estimated that in two days, all his blood would be filled with spirit force and he would break through to the mid stage of the Blood Movement Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked for more than half a day deep inside the forest and didn’t find any spirit herbs or fruits. Zhao Jiuge was feeling disappointed when he heard Little Black squeak. Little Black arrived before Zhao Jiuge and pulled Zhao Jiuge’s clothes with one arm and pointed with the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following the direction of where Little Black was pointing, Zhao Jiuge saw a cliff not far away, and more than 200 meters below was a large pool of water with a waterfall going into it on the opposite side of the pool. The color of the water was dark, but the surface was smooth and sparkling. Walking near the cliff, Zhao Jiuge could feel the coldness of the pool. He shivered and his neck shrunk back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Zhao Jiuge could react, Little Black rushed down the cliff in a few jumps and rushed straight for the pool. Zhao Jiuge felt helpless and followed Little Black down. Fortunately, after entering the Blood Movement Realm, his body had become a lot stronger and he could jump several meters at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After arriving next to the pool, the chill was even more intense. The sound of water falling into the pool echoed and ripples spread across the pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Black happily played at the edge of the pool as Zhao Jiuge bent down to touch the water. His brows furrowed as it was very cold! He felt pain coming from his finger. After entering the Blood Movement Realm, his body had become a lot stronger, so it was rare for the environment to cause him this much pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Zhao Jiuge found that a cold energy had entered his body through his finger, then the cold energy turned into spiritual energy, which was turned into spirit force by his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This discovery made Zhao Jiuge very happy. He immediately soaked himself inside the pool and activated the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit Heart Sutra. The spirit force in his body moved as the bone-chilling coldness entered his body, and he clearly felt his spirit force increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several days passed. The water in the pool was surging outward from Zhao Jiuge and the surrounding air was filled with the pressure of spirit force. However, it only lasted for a moment before disappearing. His blood was filled with spirit force as his pores continued to absorb spiritual energy. After painstakingly cultivating inside this cold pool for a few days, he had managed to break through to the mid stage of the Blood Movement Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the blood inside his body contained specs of golden light and was filled with spirit force. Zhao Jiuge sighed and revealed a satisfied smile. He looked around and found no trace of Little Black. He had likely gone off somewhere to play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, his eyes were filled with passion. Thinking about the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Divine Body, his hands formed seals. The spirit force that could be moved at the Blood Movement Realm was certainly different—it was much faster than the Spirit Detecting Realm. His movements when forming the seals were slow at first, but he soon became very skilled. Spiritual energy quickly rushed into his body and was refined by the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Divine Body. Soon, a peculiar kind of spirit force scattered throughout his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he did this a few days ago, at the early stage of the Blood Movement, the same thing happened, but now his spirit force was moving even more rapidly. After seeing the peculiar spirit force appear, his hands move even faster and his spirit force rushed toward those peculiar specks of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These peculiar specks of spirit force were gathered and fused together. Originally, each one was only the size of a bean, but now, fused together, they were the size of a small fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fusing them to the size of a small fish, he felt the same thing as last time—a sense of powerlessness. The spiritual energy coming in from the outside was not enough to keep up with the process. After all, he was only at the mid stage of the Blood Movement Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When there wasn’t enough spirit force to support it, the fusion of those peculiar specks of spirit force had collapsed. Although he had failed again, Zhao Jiuge was not frustrated, as he had progressed more than last time. This increased his desire to reach the late stage of the Blood Movement, as he believed that that’s when he would condense the first golden dragon of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His clothes were completely soaked from sitting inside the pool, and when he stood up, water droplets dripped from his body. Little Black, who had disappeared into the woods to play, had returned and was waiting at the edge of the pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Black, who had played enough, was very happy and cried out. However, he didn’t jump onto Zhao Jiuge like normal, as if Little Black disdained Zhao Jiuge’s current sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monkey and the youth were both in a good mood. After more than one month outside the valley, one had played enough and the other was happy with his cultivation progress. Although the moon was hanging high in the sky, it was still dark, with only the surface of the pool shining from the reflection of the moonlight. With the light reflecting off the pool, the youth and the monkey climbed back up the cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they climbed up the cliff, Zhao Jiuge saw a dot of light in the distance, and soon the dot began to grow. The dot of light moved like a meteor and flashed across the sky. One moment it was far away, the next it was much closer and brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge subconsciously covered his mouth. He was greatly shocked. It was a dragon boat flying through the air. The body of the dragon boat was dark yellow, as if it was carved from yellow jade. There was a red bead in the mouth of the dragon. It was breaking through the air, and one could hear the sound of the air friction. At the front of the boat stood two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When had Zhao Jiuge ever seen something like this before? Although he had occasionally gone out on adventures, they were hardly anything like this. He couldn’t help but stop breathing. A magical treasure! Zhao Jiuge had seen records about magical treasures in the jade, but there were no detailed descriptions. Now that he was seeing one for the first time, he was shocked to his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the jade tube, there were five grades of magical treasures. Spell treasures: normal weapons imbued with some spirit stones. Precious treasures: made from materials with spiritual energy from the cultivation world—very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spirit treasures: an entire treasure filled with spiritual energy, and as long as the material was good, one could even refine the soul of a Nascent Soul Realm beast into it. Its power would be beyond imagination. Immortal treasures: very few existed in the entire Huaxia Dynasty. It would take years of nourishment by the maker’s own spirit force, and each would have its own characteristics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was another special existence: heavenly treasures. These were born from heaven and earth. When the time was ripe for them to appear, a light would shine brightly, announcing their existence. They may be no weaker than immortal treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The record in the jade tube was very simple, so when he saw a magical treasure for the first time today, the shock he felt was incomparable. Even Little Black was shocked by this scene, and was even a little afraid. Little Black jumped onto Zhao Jiuge’s shoulder and stared intently ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was still in a daze from the shock when the dragon boat closed in and stopped in the sky above them with the dragon head pointed at the pool. He regained his senses and looked at the two figures standing on the boat. To be more accurate, they were two beautiful women with figures that would shock the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person on the left was wearing a pink palace dress with a bright, green hairpin that shined brightly. Her skin was as white as snow and so delicate that it seemed like she would bruise just by blowing on her. Her clear eyes and petite figure would make anyone want to love and care for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A stunning feeling shocked Zhao Jiuge’s vision. The other person was dressed more plainly. Although not as stunning, she gave off an otherworldly aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plain-clothed woman’s face was cold and without any expression and her eyes were just as clear. There was not the slight hint of emotion in her eyes. Her black hair was draped behind her shoulder and an ordinary, wooden hairpin was casually inserted into her hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them stood proudly at the head of the dragon boat as a gentle breeze blew. The edge of the plain-clothed woman’s skirt rose slightly and her hair swayed gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The edge of the skirt wasn’t the only thing that was moved. The young man’s heart was also moved because she was too beautiful.</span></p>
