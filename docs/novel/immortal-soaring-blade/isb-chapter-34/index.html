 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, Zhao Jiuge seemed to sober up a bit. Long term spirit force exhaustion and fatigue had made him lose himself. His eyes were half open in confusion as he felt something soft behind him, along with a fragrant smell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He weakly opened his eyes, and what appeared before him was a beautiful face filled with worry and concern. Seeing Zhao Jiuge wake up, Su Su exclaimed, “You woke up! I thought something happened to you. You made me worried for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge deliberately pretended to be cold. With a blank expression, he spoke in a hoarse voice, pretending to be uncomfortable “You still know how to be worried. Earlier, you were like a blockhead who just watched, doing nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, you’re the blockhead.” After hearing Zhao Jiuge’s angry words, Su Su regained her pampered nature and raised her neck. However, looking at Zhao Jiuge’s cold face, she couldn’t help but soften. She meekly said, “Are you really angry? I did it for your own good. When you overdraft your spirit force, it makes it a lot easier to cultivate. Why else would people who encounter bottlenecks go through life or death situations?” Her voice became lower and lower. In the end, she felt a bit wronged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Su’s beautiful and exquisite face in such a pitiful appearance, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but soften his expression. He gently stared at Su Su and said, “Okay, I know you did it for my own good, and if there was real danger, you wouldn’t just do nothing. I’m a block of wood, okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Zhao Jiuge’s words Su Su suddenly became happy. Her beautiful eyes lit up as she glanced at Zhao Jiuge. “You are already a block of wood, a rotten block of wood, hahah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Su laughed, her body trembled. Zhao Jiuge was lying in Su Su's arms, so as she laughed, he suddenly felt two mounds rubbing against his back. As her body continued to tremble, the constant rubbing gave him a strange but soft feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was a bit embarrassed. He already reached the age where he began to understand what love was. This strange pleasure made his breath short, and in order to avoid showing his embarrassment, he quickly shifted the topic. Su Su was still simple-mindedly smiling and didn’t realize the implication of their actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Su, what does your family do? I can see that you also cultivate, you’re very knowledgeable, and you have a good upbringing.” Zhao Jiuge awkwardly changed the subject and stared carefully at Su Su as if he wanted to figure something out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su was laughing when she heard Zhao Jiuge say that she was pampered. Surprisingly, she didn’t rebut him. Instead, her face became a bit unnatural and she became silent for a moment. She held her white cheeks and stuttered, “My family doesn’t do anything, they’re very ordinary… But I snuck out to play.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge rolled his eyes and said in a playful tone, “If I believed your words, then I’d really be a blockhead. The pale purple hairpin on your hair is not simple. At least when compared to all the magical treasures I saw at the auction house, none of them can compare to yours.” Just from her temperament, along with the things she wore, all of which gave off a noble aura, Zhao Jiuge knew Su Su was not an average person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this time, Su Su didn’t speak but revealed a faint smile and shrugged. She had a “I’m not going to speak, so what are you doing to do about it?” expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge didn’t continue because the atmosphere had become a bit strange. Su Su pursed her lips and then saw the wound on Zhao Jiuge’s chest, causing her to brown. “Let me help you dress your wound.” Her crisp voice echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s chest and right shoulder were a miserable mess. On his chest was the wound from Xiao Yun’s sword. It was ⅓ of a meter long and the surface was covered in dried-up blood. On his right shoulder was a small wound left by the skinny man’s claw. The flesh was a mess and the surface of the wound was black and grey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su lowered her head and had a serious expression as she treated Zhao Jiuge’s wounds, her actions were so tender. The silver moon still hung in the sky and the moonlight shined on Su Su’s face. Zhao Jiuge just quietly lied in Su Su’s arms, enjoying all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Su’s gentle actions and her face bathed in moonlight, she looked even more beautiful. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt like his heart was intoxicated. He thought about how great it would be if time stopped at this point forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was completely awestruck as he just stared at Su Su with those intoxicated eyes and a silly smile on his face. Su Su was cleaning up his wounds, so she didn’t notice at first. When she finally finished, she noticed Zhao Jiuge’s silly face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red suddenly appeared on her neck and spread onto her white and tender face. The normally always-proud Su Su became shy, and the difference made Zhao Jiuge chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Zhao Jiuge’s chuckle, Su Su's face became completely red and she pushed him out of her arms. In order to cover up her embarrassment, she pretended to be angry. “What are you laughing at? Scram to the side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t care that he was scolded and laughed even louder. He jokelying said, “It’s all the moon’s fault that I’m laughing. The moonlight even made such a pampered and savage girl seem beautiful and gentle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could no longer handle this kind of atmosphere. After all, she was only a 15 or 16-year-old girl. She viciously kicked Zhao Jiuge a few times and pretended to be angry while looking really cute. “Hurry up and cultivate, don’t waste such a good chance.” After turning her back toward Zhao Jiuge, the angry look was long gone and was replaced with a faint smile. She was at that age where most girls dreamed about their springtime. Not to mention a seed was already planted in her heart, just waiting for a chance to grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle breeze blew by during the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He originally planned to set down right here to cultivate to recover, but he remembered where they were. Earlier, he was having so much fun talking to and teasing Su Su that he had almost forgotten, but now he suddenly remembered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked around. The skinny man and the rotting corpses had all been turned to ashes by the Li Fire, but the scattered and broken coffins still filled the area. The entire grave still graveyard off a gloomy aura. He swallowed and said, “Let’s walk forward a bit to find a suitable place then cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Su had recovered and wouldn't let such a chance go. She turned toward Zhao Jiuge and said, “Oh, it turns out this blockhead is also a coward, eh?” She had her hand before her chest and deliberately dragged her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she said this, she still followed Zhao Jiuge out of the graveyard. After all, this was still a graveyard with coffins scattered everywhere and yellow paper littering the area. Anyone would feel uncomfortable staying here. The crows that were here were all long gone due to the battle. After the two of them left, everything became silent, as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver moonlight pierced through the gap on top of the trees and scattered on the ground. Su Su and Zhao Jiuge were both sitting beside a large tree, cultivating. Su Su was absorbing spiritual energy like normal. Zhao Jiuge had never asked Su Su what her cultivation level was and she hadn’t told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had experienced a series of battles and therefore was very tired. He had entered a state of cultivation, and after carefully observing his body, he found that the situation was kind of bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The source of his spirit force in his dantian was almost dried up and the light around it was dim. The veins along his body were damaged and there was still some grey smoke around the wound on his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the situation of his body, Zhao Jiuge revealed a helpless smile. He calmed himself and began to cultivate using the Sanskrit Heart Sutra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soft sound broke the silence of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the moonlight, ripples echoed in the sky. These fluctuations of spiritual energy went from slow to fast before they rushed toward Zhao Jiuge’s body. The spiritual energy entered his body and completed one cycle after another until it was transformed into spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was a bit shocked. He hadn’t expected what Su Su had said to be true. Now that his body was worn out, it was much easier to cultivate, as spiritual energy surged into his body. It required only half as much effort as before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the fluctuations of spirit force, the golden dragon inside his dantian began to dance inside his body. After spirit force began to nourish his body, his damaged veins also began to recover. He had just broken into the Spirit Transformation Realm, and after two consecutive battles, he was showing signs of reaching the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Zhao Jiuge ecstatic. The increase in strength was the best motivation. The golden dragon had been growing inside his body for some time and had absorbed a lot of spirit force. Now even the dragon scales on its body were visible, and it was becoming more and more lifelike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, the spirit force inside Zhao Jiuge’s body increased and the violent fluctuations around him calmed down. His breathing became calm as he continued to absorb spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su looked at Zhao Jiuge in shock and secretly thought that the cultivation method this block of wood cultivated was not simple. With her extraordinary background, what powerful treasures or mysterious cultivation methods had she not seen? However, the cultivation method Zhao Jiuge cultivated was no worse than hers, and she couldn’t see through it!</span></p>
