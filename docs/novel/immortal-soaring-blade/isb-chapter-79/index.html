 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is Moonlight Dew?” Zhao Jiuge was immediately attracted by Bai Qingqing’s words. He was very interested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Wang Baiwan, who was about to fall asleep, woke up. He rolled his eyes and looked toward Bai Qingqing. Even the somewhat crestfallen Liu Yinger looked up. This was the first time she had heard about Moonlight Dew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Moonlight Dew is a liquid that appears by absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. It usually appears where there is a lot of spiritual energy. There was a lot of it back home. I didn’t expect to see it here. It has the effect of tempering one’s physique and speeding up the rate at which your body absorbs spiritual energy. However, the more you take, the worse the effect.” Bai Qingqing looked at the other side and slowly explained it to the three others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she finished speaking, she looked at Zhao Jiuge. As expected, when he heard about the effect of the Moonlight Dew, his expression changed. He looked very happy and eager. “Then are there any side effects to this thing? Can you just directly swallow it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing lightly nodded, then everyone crossed the stream to the source of the light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an octagonal lotus as tall as a person, and there was a pool of water gathered in the lotus leaves. It shined brightly and was clear and translucent. It looked like river water but also different as it contained some spirit force. This was the Moonlight Dew Bai Qingqing was talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the three of them all looking curiously at the Moonlight Dew, Bai Qingqing softly said, "It's fine to just swallow it directly. After you swallow it, cultivate and you will see how magical it is. Also, the more you take, the less effective it becomes, so it's only good the first time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how the three of them were still indifferent, Bai Qingqing pondered a bit and said, “I drank some a long time ago, so it will have no effect on me. Each of you try it.” Her red lips closed and her beautiful eyes quietly watched their reactions. Although the Moonlight Dew was not that rare and was not as good as pills at transforming physique, it was still something that anyone would want.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The formation of the Moonlight Dew was due to nature. First, it had to be a cold place with spirit herbs growing nearby. When day arrived, the cold air would condense into dew on the spirit herbs, and when the moonlight shined on the dew, it would nourish the dew with spirit force. The better the geographical location, the more spiritual energy and the more Moonlight Dew would form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t much Moonlight Dew here, but it was still a decent amount. However, it was not enough for the three of them. After all, it was only good the first time and became less effective later on. Bai Qingqing didn’t dictate how to split the dew. Naturally, she wanted to give it to Zhao Jiuge, but what she had learned in her childhood prevented her from doing so. Therefore, she merely pushed the issue for the three of them to decide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three began to hesitate and no one spoke up. Seeing that the atmosphere had become a bit tense, Zhao Jiuge became silent and then smiled. “Liu Yinger, you come and try it first. Wang Baiwan and I are men, we don’t care.” Although he was eager to feel the magical effect of the Moonlight Dew, he was not completely ignorant of the world. Even though he wanted to increase his strength, he didn’t want to lose his friends. Zhao Jiuge, who had grown accustomed to being lonely during his childhood, knew this well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger’s lost gaze suddenly focused when she heard Zhao Jiuge’s words, and her cute face became red. “I’ll just have a taste. My family has been giving me things to help refine my physique since I was young, and they must all have similar effects. If I take the Moonlight Dew, it won’t have much effect and will just be a waste. It's better for the two of you to use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t enough Moonlight Dew for three people. The obedient Liu Yinger sensibly withdrew. Instead of all three barely getting any, it would be better to let someone else have it. That said, Liu Yinger didn’t lack such things growing up. Although the Liu family didn’t have a long history like Bai Qingqing’s family, it should not be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those words completely stunned Wang Baiwan and Zhao Jiuge. After hearing this, Wang Baiwan thought about many things and then chuckled. “Liu Yinger and I will just try it. You can have the rest. Both of us are almost the same and have taken a lot of things to help our physiques. You probably haven’t had anything like this before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s expression became complicated, but his eyes were like pools of stagnant water, calm to a terrifying degree. Although he knew everyone was thinking about what was good for him, Zhao Jiuge was unable to accept it. His self-esteem was at work. The environment he grew up in made him feel the need to become strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Bai Qingqing spoke and was as straightforward as always. “You’re a big man, don’t be a hypocrite. Quickly take it and sit down to cultivate. Stop wasting time. It’s not very precious, and we all had similar things when we were young, but you didn’t. Quickly, try it.” This made Zhao Jiuge feel a bit embarrassed, and he didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger also spoke softly. "Jiuge, hurry up. After you drink it, we will all go cultivate. It’s not early, we need to continue looking for herbs tomorrow. On the last day, we have to head back.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, when we become stronger and go out to train together, we won’t care about such things in the future.” Even Wang Baiwan followed suit and urged Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know what to do at first, but soon he was filled with determination. If he continued to refuse, he would seem a bit hypocritical. Zhao Jiuge was determined as he decisively grabbed the clear and translucent Moonlight Dew. He swallowed it and felt a cool liquid flowing down his throat and into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The taste had a bit of dry sweetness. He didn’t feel a difference after drinking it. Zhao Jiuge felt a bit unsatisfied and smacked his lips a few times. After drinking it, he waited for a while and found that nothing had happened. His eyes widened as he looked at the three of them and said in disbelief, “Is this really Moonlight Dew? Could it just be normal dew? I don’t feel anything, what’s so magical about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s eye twitch a few times. She wanted to grab Zhao Jiuge’s ear to vent her anger. She rolled her eyes and said, “What kind of heavenly treasure do you think this is? And even heavenly treasures take a while to begin working. Once you start cultivating, the effect of the Moonlight Dew will be completely stimulated and then you will know what’s so magical about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge lowered his head as though he was taught a lesson. He then looked around and found that the scenery here was pretty good. Not far away, there was a small waterfall and some soft grass. Sitting here, he couldn’t help but feel the vastness of the world and lose himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Late into the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them all sat in this quiet environment and seized the time to cultivate. None of the four were lazy. Only now did Zhao Jiuge feel a faint sense of coolness coming from his dantian and flowing into his meridians. Zhao Jiuge opened his eyes. Now was the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly activated the Sanskrit Heart Sutra and the surrounding spiritual energy rushed toward him. The spiritual energy turned into spirit force, and when he began absorbing the spirit force, he found what was different from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The speed was faster than before, and he felt like there was a change in his body. The places where this cool feeling went through became even stronger. Zhao Jiuge finally felt the magical thing Bai Qingqing was talking about. For the first time, Zhao Jiuge lamented about the effects of these heavenly treasures. At the same time, he vaguely felt like the Sanskrit Divine Body was stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them spent the night silently cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At dawn, the four of them withdrew from their cultivation states. After taking the Moonlight Dew, the injuries he had suffered before had almost recovered and his spirit force had become even more refined. Zhao Jiuge breathed in the fresh air. At first, he was a bit worried about the fight against the youth with the scar, but now he was not worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Qingqing saw Zhao Jiuge’s appearance, her beautiful eyes narrowed and her mouth curved upward. “So, did you experience how magical the Moonlight Dew was?” She looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile that wasn’t a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, I experienced it. It is really extraordinary. It's a pity that its effect is only good the first time; otherwise, I like to drink it a few more times. It turns out there are many mysterious things in this world. I have to save my sect contributions, then I won’t have to worry about not being able to improve my strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes. “Do you think everything is that easy to find? Also, they all have similar effects. If you take too much, they won’t be as effective. Heaven is fair and will leave you with a glimmer of hope. If one door closes, then a window will open for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger smiled as they looked at the two bickering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterward, they were attracted by a burst of footsteps. Zhao Jiuge turned his head and saw six figures. One of them was extraordinary. Several people surrounded their group, and all of them wore green sword robes. They also had wooden swords behind them. Although the color of their robes was different, they all had a small, silver swords on their cuffs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s pupils shrank and he felt a bit surprised. “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples!”</span></p>
