 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar’s body had been refined by the elders of his home with various herbs. When he was five years old, he began learning the family’s cultivation method. Then, at the age of eight, he followed the elders of his family to cultivate inside the Barbarian Forest. During that time, not only did his cultivation level increase, he also learned combat skills and gained actual combat experience. His killing intent and the aura of a peerless beast came from all the spirit beasts he had killed since he was a child. When other children were still acting spoiled in their parents’ arms, he was already living a hellish life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, when he faced the new disciples that had no combat experience, including Zhao Jiuge, he didn’t consider them worthy. The youth with the scar had a cruel sneer on the corner of his mouth. The ray of silver sword energy he sent out was like the waning moon, glowing with frostiness. It continued to expand in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that somewhat amazing strike, even Zhao Jiuge sighed. He was still inferior to the youth with the scar in terms of sword art. Ever since he came into contact with the sword art, he had constantly been improving. Although his talent was not as good, that didn’t mean he couldn’t make up for it with diligence. It was impossible to stop him like this! A ruthless look appeared on Zhao Jiuge’s face and he let out a cold snort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tightly gripped the wooden sword and his spirit force surged into it. He felt the oppressive sword intent from his opponent. Zhao Jiuge’s wooden sword shined, and he felt powerful as he held the wooden sword. He relied on the sword intent he had comprehended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were going head-to-head using their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another ray of dazzling silver sword light flew out. If the youth with the scar’s sword energy was like the courageous lone boat bravely piercing through the stormy ocean, then Zhao Jiuge’s sword energy was like a small star. Although it was small now, it was still dazzling. As long as he persisted, it would shine brightly one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before everyone’s expectant gazes, the two of them finally collided. With a bit of tenacity and anger, Zhao Jiuge’s sword light collided with the sword light from the youth with the scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment they collided, a dazzling light bright like the scorching sun erupted. Without any surprise, the sword intent that was like the waning moon easily shattered Zhao Jiuge’s sword light. However, the shockwave of the collision spread out and collided with the light shielding the platform. The shockwave disappeared, but the light curtain remained unmoved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining sword intent still carried cold intent toward Zhao Jiuge’s face. Zhao Jiuge had been caught off guard and couldn’t react, so he was hit back. His center of gravity was knocked off balance and he staggered back a few steps. Fortunately, the remaining sword intent was not very powerful, and even without the Sanskrit Divine body, Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force was enough to resist it. However, the impact made it so he was forced back a few steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar would not go down easy. When Zhao Jiuge staggered back, the youth with the scar moved back. He then stepped forward like the wind and his wrist moved, sending out three rays of sword energy. He then injected spirit force into the wooden sword, intending to beat Zhao Jiuge up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, when he hit a thick tree trunk, he could easily cut the tree down. The youth with the scar directly hit Zhao Jiuge’s head and chest with those three strikes. This attack was indeed vicious. It has to be said that if Zhao Jiuge failed to guard properly, it could seriously injure his internal organs; that blow to the head could be especially life-threatening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar was like a madman once the battle began. He was like a fierce beast, and he wouldn't stop until he killed his prey. Zhao Jiuge was his prey at this moment. Once he made a move, he was going to deal with Zhao Jiuge quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was caught off guard and hit by the remaining sword intent. While staggering back, he saw the youth with the scar launch a flurry of attacks at him. His pupils widened with panic as he looked at the wooden sword close in on him. His heart skipped a beat and cold sweat covered his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The timid female disciples were already screaming, and some had even covered their eyes with the tender hands. They watched through the gaps of their fingers. Liu Yinger was like an ant in a hot pot. When she saw Zhao Jiuge in danger, she anxiously stomped her feet, but she couldn’t do anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing just coldly looked at this thrilling scene, and her fists were clenched to the point of turning white. She was worried about Zhao Jiuge in her heart, but her face didn’t show it. She thought that if it was over so fast, it wouldn’t fit this guy’s mysterious style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge in a sorry state on the stage, Bai Zimo couldn’t help but smile. He had a gloating expression and took pleasure in seeing Zhao Jiuge suffer. He secretly cursed,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“You deserve it. If I didn’t deal with you, someone else was going to take care of you. Next time, I’ll take care of you myself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were various reactions from the people below. There was contempt, mockery, regret, but mostly disbelief. Could this fight be over so quickly? This made all the people who were hoping for a wonderful performance to look disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the older disciples in the sky hadn’t said a word, they just quietly watched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou couldn't help wrinkle his brows, changing from his originally stern face. His body was tense and he was ready to take action if something went wrong. Although he was optimistic about Zhao Jiuge, he couldn’t let disciples take substantial damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing this thrilling scene, the retreating Zhao Jiuge stretched out his left leg and slammed into the ground to stop his body. He used the friction of the ground to resist the impact of the sword intent that had hit him. Then, in a smooth movement, he threw the wooden sword in his hand out at the strike that was aimed at his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His wooden sword collided with the wooden sword of the youth with the scar, but it was knocked away more than a dozen meters. The spirit force in it dissipated and it fell to the ground. The youth with the scar was surprised by this, but he sneered in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you think just blocking one strike would be enough? Your wooden sword is now gone, let's see how you will resist the remaining two hits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throwing the wooden sword shocked all the disciples. What kind of move was that? Everyone began to laugh. Even the older disciples who hadn’t made a sound began to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou was also stunned, then his eyes lit up as if he had thought of something. Then he secretly gave a compliment in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a cunning boy, this move is indeed beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the other two hits landed on Zhao Jiuge’s body. Fortunately, he was already mentally prepared for the pain and tightly guarded the front of his body with spirit force. However, after being hit, the bone-piercing pain was still difficult to endure. He couldn’t help but clench his teeth and suck in a breath of cold air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was only willing to risk this move because his physical body had been enhanced greatly by the Sanskrit Divine Body. Although it was painful, it was just as he had expected—nothing major had happened. Although the sword energy was sharp, his body was not the same as before. He had lost his wooden sword and had been hit, but it didn’t have any big impact on his combat ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being hit by the sword energy, Zhao Jiuge shrank back and borrowed the force to retreat. His hands tightly protected his head and he curled up. When his body flew more than 10 meters through the air, he quickly stretched out his right hand to touch the ground. However, he still couldn’t negate the force, so he simply rolled in an embarrassing state on the ground for several more meters. Then he immediately jumped up, ignoring his sorry image and the sharp pain in his chest. When he was standing again, he quickly formed seals with his hands. A layer of golden light surrounded Zhao Jiuge’s body—it was the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throwing away the wooden sword, being knocked away on the ground, and activating the Sanskrit Divine Body had happened without a pause, like flowing water. It was clear that Zhao Jiuge had planned all of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wonderful sequence made the disciples outside all applaud. At this moment, they were not cheering for people they liked, but shouting for such a wonderful fight. The battle had just begun and there was already such a thrilling scene. Everyone began looking forward to the rest of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw that Zhao Jiuge hadn’t suffered much damage and had stood up just fine after being knocked away more than a dozen meters and even released a spell, the youth with the scar became gloomy. “Consider yourself lucky if you’re still fine after that. But you’re already using spells? Then don’t blame me for bullying you. Let’s see if you’re still lucky enough to keep dodging.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he continued to speak, the youth with the scar became even more fierce. He saw Bai Qingqing’s worried expression for Zhao Jiuge from the corner of his eye. This made the bloodthirst in his eyes become even stronger. If looks could kill, Zhao Jiuge’s body would be full of holes already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After getting up, Zhao Jiuge’s breathing was slightly rough. When he was flying through the air, he had felt faint pain in his chest. Now that he had stopped, he felt like he shouldn’t breathe too fast, because when his chest heaved up and down, he felt intense pain. The pain made him grit his teeth, but as the Sanskrit Divine Body cycled through his body, the spirit force in his meridians helped ease the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge had just activated the initial state of the Sanskrit Divine Body, so there was only a layer of golden light around the surface of his body. As time passed, Zhao Jiuge had become more and more fond of the Sanskrit Divine Body. He had come to understand it better and gained a better grasp of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his spirit force was slowly draining after using his spell, Zhao Jiuge didn’t take the initiative. Instead, his body was tense and he carefully released the Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>

Then let’s see if it's you who will dodge this time .” Zhao Jiuge admitted that his sword art was not as good, but if it came to a competition of spirit force, he was confident. Not only did he have the Sanskrit Divine Body, he had also taken the Moonlight Dew and Spirit Tempering Pill. Zhao Jiuge had discovered that his spirit force had become even more refined. Even though he was only at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, his spirit force could match against those at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm; he could even suppress them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge acting like a bastard and hiding like a tortoise, the youth with the scar couldn’t help but become angry. He no longer wanted to talk nonsense with Zhao Jiuge. He surged his spirit force and suddenly rushed forward like a storm. This sudden action shocked Zhao Jiuge. Seeing the youth with the scar becoming more and more crazy, Zhao Jiuge felt dread. If he won today, it would be a miserable victory, but it was still better than losing.</span></p>
