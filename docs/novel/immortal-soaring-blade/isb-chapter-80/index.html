 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was created, there have been three peaks that complemented and restricted each other. The Mysterious Heaven Peak wore blue sword robes, the Mysterious Fallen Peak wore green sword robes, and the Mysterious Strange Peak wore yellow sword robes. After three years, the disciples of each peak would have a chance to enter the inner sect, where they would naturally get another set of clothes. Only the inner sect disciples were allowed to wear those.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, in the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, one only needed to see another’s clothes to know the position they held within the sect. Zhao Jiuge was surprised to see Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples here. When he entered the sect, he learned that the Mysterious Heaven Peak had always been in charge. All the sect masters came from their lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mysterious Heaven Sect was united and faced the outside world as a group. Even though it had declined, it still firmly held on to its position as one of the seven holy grounds. No one dared to think about making any moves against the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. However, the other two peaks always had issues with the Mysterious Heaven Peak being in charge. Therefore, the disciples always had problems with each other, and a lot of small disputes broke out. When Zhao Jiuge and company saw those people close in, they were all secretly on guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they got closer, Zhao Jiuge saw the face of the person that had arrived. The person had a handsome face and a pair of thick eyebrows. His long hair was curled up and his lips were a bit thin. He had an outstanding temperament and stood out at a glance. At this moment, he was also observing Zhao Jiuge’s group. There was a playful light in his eyes and his mouth was curved upward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside him was a vicious-looking youth who had his head slightly lowered as he stared at Zhao Jiuge’s group of four. His voice was thin like a mosquito’s. “Brother Liang, it's disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak.” After he finished speaking, his eyes were filled with vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth in the lead nodded lightly. Then he smiled as clasped his hands with grace. “My name is Liang Bowen. It's my first time encountering disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak. Are you all here to complete the mission of collecting the herbs?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Zhao Jiuge was shocked, and he understood why he would meet Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples. It turned out that the other two peaks had also released their disciples with the same mission. However, this just put Zhao Jiuge even more on guard. After dealing with Bai Zimo, it just made Zhao Jiug even more worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So what if we are?” Bai Qingqing said with a dissatisfied expression with her chin raised. Her enchanting eyes stared coldly at the Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples, and her arms were crossed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak were all drawn over. They weren’t really paying attention before, but when they saw Bai Qingqing’s appearance, they all sighed. Her crossed arms made her chest even more pronounced, and her graceful body was wrapped tightly in the blue sword robe. Her silk-like black hair was lazily draped down and wasn’t tied up. It formed a sharp contrast with her white and tender skin and attractive, red lips. Her enchanting temperament caused all of them to stare at her. The vicious youth even swallowed hard, and it was a very loud sound in this quiet atmosphere. Only Liang Bowen looked with some interest and then withdrew his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, as for what I think about a beautiful woman? Well, what else can a man think about?” Liang Bowen chuckled lightly. He had a seemingly kind smile, but the words he spat out were unkind. The Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples were hostile toward the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples from the moment they met. Their smiles were filled with hidden blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Bai Qingqing’s eyes widened like an angry lioness’. Her exquisite face became frosty and her spirit force fluctuated as if she was ready to attack. At this moment, Liang Bowan revealed a fake smile and changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wanted to ask if you guys picked the Sulphur Grass here, or did it disappear before you all arrived?” Liang Bowen was smiling, but his eyes were dark and cold. If Zhao Jiuge’s group lied, he would become angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Liang, the news can’t be wrong. Yesterday, Junior Brother Yu saw a large amount of Sulphur Grass below the waterfall and immediately rushed to inform us. There is no one else here, how could it not be them who took it?” This time, the vicious-looking youth spoke loudly so everyone could hear. He looked at Zhao Jiuge and company with ill intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was this old lady who picked it. What can you do about it?” Bai Qingqing’s domineering aura erupted, and this simply showed Zhao Jiuge her arrogance. When a woman became angry, there was a certain charm to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These domineering words stunned all the Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples. After a while, Liang Bowen smiled, but he didn’t speak. He also had his own pride, and among the Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples, he was among the top. He stood out among the crowd and was praised by others. When had anyone talked to him like this before? Anger surged in his heart and his chest began to heave up and down violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan smiled as if he was watching a play. Bai Qingqing’s expression made Wang Baiwan gain some insight. There was no trace of tension or fear at all, it was as if nothing here had anything to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What can we do about it? What an arrogant tone. If you know what’s good for you, hand over the Sulphur Grass. Otherwise, I’ll let you know how powerful the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak are. See what you can do!” This disciple of the Mysterious Fallen Peak had a sharp mouth and was like a dog. His annoying appearance made Bai Qingqing want to rush up and give him a beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Liang, since they admitted that they have taken the Sulphur grass, and we have more people, let’s teach the people of the Mysterious Heaven Peak a lesson.” After that person spoke, they moved into a fan shape and vaguely surrounded Zhao Jiuge’s group. They seemed to be waiting for the word from Liang Bowen to act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp-mouthed youth’s words had completely angered Zhao Jiuge, who had been coldly watching from the start. He could not stand it anymore. If he didn’t stand up now, he would no longer be considered a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What guts. Let’s see what ability your Mysterious Fallen Peak has to teach us a lesson.” Zhao Jiuge let out a yell and his spirit force erupted violently from his body. Bright, golden lights shined as he stepped forward and shielded Bai Qingqing behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force erupting, the six people from the Mysterious Fallen Peak also released their spirit force. They were no weaker than Zhao Jiuge. Liang Bowen sneered, “There are six of us and only four of you, and there are two women. I want to see how you will turn this around today. It’s too late now even if you hand over the Sulphur Grass. If we don’t teach you a lesson today, you won’t know how powerful the Mysterious Fallen Peak is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Bowen was also at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the pressure of spirit force, Wang Baiwan, Bai Qingqing, and Liu Yinger also released their spirit force. They also had Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation, which surprised the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak, but they soon recovered. After all, it was six against two, so they were confident. Although Zhao Jiuge and company were probably the best among this group of disciples, Liang Bowen was not worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Zhao Jiuge was a bit worried, he showed no sign of backing down. How could he hand over the Sulphur Grass he had found? He wanted to trade it for sect contributions. However, he did feel a bit helpless. First, he had encountered the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, and after that, he ran into Bai Zimo. Now he had run into the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak. Every time his old injuries healed, new ones were made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as everyone was ready to fight, a voice broke the tense atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, is that right? Now look who has more people!” A chuckle echoed as four figures slowly walked out from the forest. All four of them were wearing blue sword robes. It was Mu Zijun, and he had three Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden appearance of Mu Zijun dissipated the tense atmosphere and both sides relaxed. Liang Bowen’s expression secretly changed, but he soon regained his calmness. The situation was a bit beyond his expectations, and he quietly watched Mu Zijun walk over. He secretly thought about how to deal with the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun arrived with a chuckle and brought the three people with him. Now Liang Bowen was surrounded by Mu Zijun and Zhao Jiuge. Mu Zijun looked at Liang Bowen with a smile before he turned toward Zhao Jiuge and kindly asked, “Brother Jiuge, are you guys all right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression and tone were filled with concern. If not for the fact that Zhao Jiuge was on guard against Mu Zijun, they would be very good friends. People who didn’t know Mu Zijun would think he was very kind, but only Zhao Jiuge knew how scheming Mu Zijun was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun also knew Zhao Jiuge and also had some prejudice toward him, but on the matter between the Mysterious Fallen Peak and the Mysterious Heaven Peak, he was willing to drop all private issues to unite against a common enemy. This was also a good time to show off his strength and charm more people to his side. The three people behind him were disciples who wanted to get on his good side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge responded to Mu Zijun’s kind inquiry with a lukewarm nod. His brows furrowed as he carefully looked at Liang Bowen to see what he had planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, this brother is joking. I was just looking for Sulphur Grass, and a junior disciple of mine found a large patch here. We came over to harvest it, something happened to cause a misunderstanding.” Seeing how both sides were blocked and the situation was bad for him, Liang Bowen changed attitude faster than flipping through a book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really know your place.” Mu Zijun sneered and then looked at Zhao Jiuge. “Jiuge, how do you want to deal with them? Anyways, no one better think they can suppress our Mysterious Heaven Peak.”</span></p>
