 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sentence caused Zhao Jiuge’s impression of Mu Zijun to change a little. Although Mu Zijun was cunning, he was not as cruel and vicious as Bai Zimo, who didn’t care about others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering a bit, Zhao Jiuge felt like it was better to have fewer things to worry about than more things to worry about. “Let them go, this is not the time to fight. There will be a chance in the future.” After he finished speaking, he looked meaningfully at Liang Bowen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll listen to you and let them go. The next time we meet, we have to settle the score.” Mu Zijun revealed a look of expectation. They were all young and energetic—they wanted to fight to see who was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait.” However, Liang Bowen suddenly shouted and shocked everyone. They were wondering what new tricks Liang Bowen was going to play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have found six herbs and am just short of the Sulphur Grass. You picked a lot of Sulphur Grass. I’ll trade one with you. I think you have a lot. If you need any herbs, just say it and I’ll trade for it.” Liang Bowen’s tone revealed his anxiousness. After all, the Sulphur Grass he needed had been picked, so he was very anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that Liang Bowen had also found six herbs and was only missing the Sulphur Grass, Zhao Jiuge found it a bit funny. He had also found six herbs and was only missing the Lilac Water. Since Liang Bowen was willing to trade for any herb, Zhao Jiuge impatiently asked, “Do you have Lilac Water?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do. Let’s trade?” Liang Bowen’s eyes were filled with expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing Liang Bowen’s question, Zhao Jiuge answer by waving his right hand before Liang Bowen’s eyes and taking out the Sulphur Grass. When Liang Bowne saw the Sulphur Grass, he couldn’t help but reveal his excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liang Bowen had also found six herbs, and as he looked at the Sulphur Grass, his breathing became rough. His eyes moved away from the grass and his gaze became serious. He clasped his hands. “Brother Jiuge, if you’re willing to trade today, I’ll remember this favor. However, the others won’t receive such treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Liang Bowen’s expression gradually cooled down. These words were naturally directed at Mu Zijun. If not for the lack of time and the fact that he was just missing this herb to take first place, given his personality, Liang Bowen would not have been so nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have Lilac Water, we can trade. If you don’t have it, then forget it, or you can try to find it for the trade.” His words were simple and concise. This was Zhao Jiuge’s way of speaking. Faced with Liang Bowen’s hypocritical rhetoric, he didn’t care. There was no disgust on his face, he just calmly stated his requirement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do, I have extra.” After Liang Bowen finished speaking, he quickly gestured to the vicious-looking youth. After seeing this, the vicious-looking youth quickly took out an ordinary-looking porcelain jade bottle and handed it to Liang Bowen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge threw the Sulphur Grass before Liang Bowen. Liang Bowen was startled as he hadn’t expected Zhao Jiuge to be so easygoing that he would throw the Sulphur Grass first. Liang Bowen threw the jade bottle over and Zhao Jiuge quickly grabbed it. He opened the bottle and sniffed it a few times, then he looked inside to see a lump of liquid. After confirming that it was the Lilac Water, he calmly put it away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he looked calm, his heart was burning with passion. If there weren’t so many people here, he would be laughing toward the sky right now. He had finally found all the herbs. Although the process was not glorious, the result was the most important. More importantly, he would get sect contributions. Only with sect contributions could he buy treasures and increase his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The transaction between the two was completed in an instant. Mu Zijun and everyone else watched quietly. When they saw Zhao Jiuge throw the Sulphur Grass, an ordinary-looking youth beside Mu Zijun walked up and said a few words. Mu Zijun just shook his head and then looked at Zhao Jiuge with a complicated gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With their herbs in hand, both parties were satisfied, and Liang Bowen didn’t stay too long. After all, the situation was not good for him, so he temporarily suppressed his inner joy. He led his group and slowly walked out from the encirclement. When the group left the encirclement, cold words filled with killing intent erupted from Liang Bowen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll let you feel proud this time, but in one year, when the new disciples begin accepting missions, we’ll definitely meet again. I’m not afraid of you, but I have more important things to do. I hope you won’t let me down next time we meet. I want to see the sorry state of the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling that terrifying killing intent, Mu Zijun’s eyes shined, but he didn’t make a move. He raised his sword-like eyebrows slightly and released an aura no weaker than Liang Bowen’s. “Is that so? It will all be clear by then. Since the beginning of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, your Mysterious Fallen Peak has always been suppressed by the Mysterious Heaven Peak. It is the same now, and in the future… it will still be the same.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those arrogant words caused Liang Bowen to stop, but he didn’t turn around. Just as everyone thought Liang Bowen was going to become angry, he just chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At that time, let the facts speak.” Then Liang Bowen and company moved further and further away until they disappeared into the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After arriving at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, Zhao Jiuge understood why Ye Wuyou had said that on the path of cultivation, people were more terrifying than dangerous places full of spirit beasts. Cultivation wasn’t just a battle against heaven and earth, but a fight against people. Not only was there competition within the Mysterious Heaven Peak, there was competition between the three peaks, and outside, there were competitions between the sects. Sure enough, the path of cultivation was one step of life or death at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Liang Bowen leave, Mu Zijun turned his head and looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile. “It seems like you have found all the herbs, and we are ready to leave as well. Let’s go back together since we all have to go back.” Even though Mu Zijun was extremely unhappy in his heart, he still kept a civil expression and continued to talk to Zhao Jiuge. Mu Zijun had always wanted to pull the mysterious Zhao Jiuge to his side. Wang Baiwan and Bai Qingqing were not of his concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You don’t hit a smiling person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how much he disliked Mu Zijun, when Zhao Jiuge faced Mu Zijun’s smile, he also smiled back. “Yes, it was mostly luck though.” Although his words were humble, he was quite content in his heart. After all, finding seven herbs in this vast mountain had not been not easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, luck is part of strength.” After he finished speaking, he stepped forward and put his hand on Zhao Jiuge’s shoulder in a friendly manner. This caused the pupils of Wang Baiwan and Bai Qingqing to shrink. They didn’t like Mu Zijun’s attitude. Only Liu Yinger had an easygoing and calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mysterious Heaven Peak, main square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three figures had already been waiting here for a long time, and the three-day time limit was going to end soon. During these few days, everyone’s actions were naturally seen by the three instructors. They clearly understood everything, and what shocked them was that no one had used the talismans to ask for help. The three of them were used to rescuing people, so they felt a bit uncomfortable. The three of them silently waited for the result of the first mission and for the disciples to return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each of the three instructors had their own thoughts, and they all had their own favorite disciples. Not only would the top three groups get 100 sect contributions, there would also be an award. The reward was especially important for disciples at the Spirit Transformation Realm. As for the disciples in the Blood Movement Realm or the Spirit Detecting Realm, their chances of getting into the top three were very small. The weaker one’s physical fitness was, the shorter the distance they could travel, greatly reducing their search range. There was almost no hope in finding all the herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the scorching sun completely rose into the sky, a figure finally slowly arrived at the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of more than 10 people finally saw the square of the Mysterious Heaven Peak. Mu Zijun and his group were there also, but Zhao Jiuge was not worried about them, because they hadn’t found all the herbs. Ranking didn’t depend on who arrived first, but how many herbs they had found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge arrived at the square, there were more than 20 people present. He panicked in his heart and then forcibly calmed himself down. He was trying to think optimistically. Maybe they had come back without finding all the herbs. After that, he began to think random thoughts for a while. If he was lucky enough to find all the herbs, then couldn’t others be lucky as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing seemed to know what Zhao Jiuge was thinking, so she had a big smile on her face. She pursed her red lips and teased, “It’s all over. You were expecting to take first place and earn those 100 sect contributions, but it seems all hope is lost. Not even Big Sister can help you now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge ignored Bai Qingqing’s teasing and rolled his eyes at her. The result would be announced later, so it was useless to think about it now. He would go with the flow, there was no need to force it. Anyway, in a year, he would be able to accept missions and earn sect contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a lot of people on the square, and disciples continued to return. When more disciples arrived, it became lively. Everyone told each other about what they had experienced during the past three days, They were all curious about who the top three would be. Of course, they were more interested in the fight Zhao Jiuge and the youth with the scar had agreed to three days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the topic of the youth with the scar and Zhao Jiuge was brought up, the result of this mission seemed less important. While everyone was discussing the fight, some people were observing Zhao Jiuge and the youth with the scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge was as calm as water with Mu Zijun, Bai Qingqing, Wang Baiwan, Liu Yinger, and the others. On the side of the youth with the scar, it was much more lively. There were more than a dozen people around the youth with the scar. They were talking and laughing about something.</span></p>
