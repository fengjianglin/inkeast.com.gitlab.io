 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Han Songcheng, who was filled with sincere fear, Zhao Jiuge was stunned. The contrast was too big. The moment Han Songcheng realized the situation was not good, he knelt down to beg for mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, compared to his life, what did begging count as? When Han Songcheng was knocked away, he knew very clearly that it would be a difficult crisis to escape from. He was not their match, and he guessed they were disciples from a big sect. Otherwise, how could someone in the same realm as him be so much stronger? Rogue cultivators couldn’t compare to disciples from big sects that had cultivation methods, treasures, spells, and resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng was afraid of death; otherwise, he wouldn’t lower himself to kneel down and beg for mercy. Although he was forcing himself to pretend he was pitiful and repenting, he was rapidly thinking about how to escape this crisis. He tried to secretly use his spirit force, but he only felt pain. His meridians were damaged from the golden dragons’ attack. He couldn’t resist, so he had to rely on his wits to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Zhao Jiuge had encountered a situation like this, so he didn’t know what to do. He looked at Bai Qingqing with a questioning gaze. Bai Qingqing was also a bit shocked by Han Songcheng’s actions, but she had seen much when she was young and quickly recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing remain silent, Han Songcheng thought the two youths were hesitating. He wanted to take advantage of this situation and quickly said, “As long as you let me go, I’ll do whatever you guys want, just let me live.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing already had the intent to kill. When she heard those words, she suddenly remembered something. She suppressed the killing intent in her heart and calmly said, “Speak, where are the other parts of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s face became stiff for a moment and then he muttered to himself, “Eight Desolate Sword Diagram?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw Bai Qingqing’s unkind gaze, he got so scared that he immediately remembered. He quickly said, “I have the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram, I have it. I gave it to Zhang Long, but his was a copy. I have the original here with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he endured the pain in his body and pulled out a folded piece of yellow satin. Feeling excruciating pain from every movement, he handed it over to Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing took the yellow satin and opened it to take a look. She carefully looked at it, and the more she looked, the uglier her expression became. Finally, she closed the yellow satin and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing and couldn’t figure out the situation. If Bai Qingqing hadn’t mentioned this, he would have forgotten about it. He quickly took the original copy of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holding the yellow satin, he felt a cool feeling from his fingertips. Zhao Jiuge touched it and didn't know what it was made of. It felt like jade but wasn’t jade, it felt like paper but wasn’t paper. The satin gave off a soft glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t hold himself back and opened the original copy of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram. The broken formation already had the power of superimposing spirit force, which he envied greatly. It was difficult to imagine what kind of amazing power the complete sword formation would have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge opened the yellow satin in his hand and curiously looked at it. He patiently looked at every detail. Han Songcheng remained kneeling on the ground, his face filled with fear while looking at the two of them. He didn’t move and didn’t dare to breathe too loudly. He was afraid any movement would cause some misunderstanding with Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. Even though he felt pain from his entire body and sweat was flowing down his forehead, he could only clench his teeth. He was secretly gathering spirit force inside his body, but when he tried to use it, he felt intense pain from his broken meridians. This forced him to give up on this idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression remained unchanged as he seriously stared at the satin. When he got to the end, he was stunned and looked at Bai Qingqing with doubt in his eyes. “Aren’t these the same as the images from before, only the material they’re printed on is different? Didn’t you say it's a broken sword formation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Bai Qingqing not see that this was exactly the same as before? Her face was already extremely gloomy and she turned a deaf ear to Zhao Jiuge’s question. She coldly said, “Jiuge, kill him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words were filled with killing intent. This scared Han Songcheng so much, he began screaming. He was anxious and afraid. His sudden movement caused him to feel even more pain from his injuries, and he breathed like a broken fan. “Wait, wait, don’t kill me. I’m still useful to you guys, don’t kill me. Make sure I’m worthless before killing me.” While he spoke, he waved his hands back and forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had already raised his sword and began hesitated, the spirit light around his sword dimmed. Interested in Han Songcheng’s words, he said, “Oh? Then speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can give you information about the eight Desolate Sword Formation.” He swallowed hard and felt a bit of relief. Zhao Jiuge’s action and the killing intent he felt were not just to scare him. He was so scared that he was covered in cold sweat now. If he had been a bit slower, he would be dead already. Through Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge’s conversation, he knew the general situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge looked at each other, then Zhao Jiuge said, “Then speak, see if it satisfies me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“About three years ago, I killed someone at the early stage of the Foundation Realm and obtained the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram. Originally, I thought it was just an ordinary item, but I didn’t expect that brat to be so rich despite his weak cultivation. The grey flying sword was also from that brat. To deal with the brat, I lost two Blood Movement Realm subordinates. He was seriously injured, and when I was about to deliver the final blow, he shouted something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Han Songcheng swallowed hard and determined that his words had piqued Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s interest. Then he continued, “He said he was the Qing Province’s Ten Thousand Devil Nest’s ancestor, Yellow Devil’s, disciple. He said that if I dared to kill him, his master wouldn’t let me live. Although that person sounds powerful, the Qing Province is very far away from here. At the time, I was tempted by the wealth the brat had and ended up killing him. I searched his body and found the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram. If you want to obtain the other parts of the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram, you can head to the Qing Province to try. Of course, that’s if you’re confident in your strength.” This time, Han Songcheng remained silent and waited for Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Han Songcheng’s words Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing frowned. The Huxia Dynasty had a total of 13 states, and the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was in the Mysterious Province, far away from the Qing Province. They don’t know the strength of the Yellow Devil Ancestor and even if they went they might not necessarily find the rest of the sword formation. Maybe this was only something that person obtained by accident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no matter the case, Zhao Jiuge still remembered this information. The Qing Province’s Ten Thousand Devil Nest and the Yellow Devil Ancestor. After all, this sword formation was simply too powerful—even just an incomplete portion already brought such great benefits. It was a chance to increase his strength, and Zhao Jiuge would not let it pass by so easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It doesn’t seem like this information is enough to buy your life,” Zhao Jiuge said with impatience in his tone. He felt regretful that he wasn’t able to obtain the complete Eight Desolate Sword Diagram from Han Songcheng. His mood worsened and his expression became ugly as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge thought Han Songcheng would desperately beg for mercy, but after he spoke, Han Songcheng seemed to have expected this result. His face was calm and he seemed to be struggling to make a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of a ray of sword energy forming echoed. Bai Qingqing could not hold back her belly full of anger anymore. She had recovered some spirit force from the pill and was still recovering. Han Songcheng had again and again played tricks to stall for time. Bai Qingqing had enough. No matter what, she was going to kill Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Bai Qingqing was going to kill him, Han Songcheng panicked and finally spat out, “I can tell you a secret, but you have to let me go. I’ll swear a Heavenly Dao Oath that it is definitely worth more than my life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Heavenly Dao Oath was the most convincing oath because cultivators walked against the heavens. They seeked to become immortal, and this wasn’t accepted by heaven and earth. However, the Heavenly Dao always left one with a path of survival, so it allowed all living things a chance to comprehend the Heavenly Dao and become immortal. However, very, very few had been able to achieve it. Once a cultivator swore a Heavenly Dao Oath, they would suffer if they violated the oath in a certain way during their cultivation. That was why if a cultivator swore a Heavenly Dao Oath, they would 100% keep their word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Qingqing was so angry that didn’t care about anything. Angering her was more terrifying than anything. Even if it was an amazing secret, she didn’t want to listen. If she was going to kill, she was going to kill, there was nothing to speak about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was irritated again and again by Han Songcheng, but this time, since the Heavenly Dao Oath was brought up, it was unlikely Han Songcheng would lie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly grabbed Bai Qingqing’s soft waist and stopped her from wielding her Wind Flower Sword. He softly whispered into her ear, “Qingqing, first listen to what he has to say and see what he is playing at.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had never been hugged at the waist by another person, much less a man. Perhaps only her father had ever hugged her like this before. Bai Qingqing was suddenly overwhelmed, so she subconsciously nodded. And listening to Zhao Jiuge whisper in her ear gave her an itchy feeling that made her thoughts go all over the place. On the other hand, Zhao Jiuge was anxious to stop Bai Qingqing so he could listen to what Han Songcheng had to say, so he hadn’t thought about his actions at all. Feeling the softness in his right hand, he felt very comfortable and even squeezed a few times. This made Bai Qingqing even more anxious and shy—she was afraid to move. She was no longer her explosive self, and if this were anyone else, she would have already cut them down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll speak and I’ll swear by the Heavenly Dao Oath, but you two have to swear on the Heavenly Dao Oath as well. After I tell you the secret, you’ll have to spare me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sentence caused Zhao Jiuge to become conflicted. He absolutely could not let Han Songcheng go. However, if he doesn’t hear the secret, his heart would itch. He didn't know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment of hesitation, Zhao Jiuge raised the Blue Plum Sword in his left hand and pointed it at Han Songcheng. He viciously said, “Are you going to speak or not? If you won’t speak, then I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, Han Songcheng remained stubborn. “Then kill me. If you don’t swear by the Heavenly Dao Oath, I won’t tell you. Otherwise, after I tell you, you will still kill me.” After he finished speaking, he closed his eyes and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Zhao Jiuge had no way of dealing with him. While Zhao Jiuge was conflicted, Bai Qingqing, who was being hugged by Zhao Jiuge around the waist, became sober. She had heard the talk between Zhao Jiuge and Han Songcheng. Because Zhao Jiuge was blocking her line of sight, she quickly pinched Zhao Jiuge’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the pinch on his back, Zhao Jiuge looked out from the corner of his eye in confusion but quickly recovered. He knew that Bai Qingqing would not harm him, so he said, “Fine. I promise you with the Heavenly Dao above and the karmic cycle that if I, Zhao Jiuge, don’t let Han Songcheng go, my soul will shatter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making the Heavenly Dao Oath, Zhao Jiuge looked at Han Songcheng with an unkind expression and said, “Okay, now say what this secret that is more valuable than your life is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Han Songcheng didn’t waste time. He decisively whispered, “Under Fallen Leaf Mountain, there seems to be a Purple Ji Spirit Stone Mine.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Han Songcheng’s voice was small, it was like a bolt of thunder to Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
