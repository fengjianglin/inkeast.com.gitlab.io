 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Relying on his brute force, he charged forward. At the Spirit Transformation Realm, even though he couldn’t use his spirit force, his body had already been forged during the Blood Movement Realm, making him far stronger than an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly ran, creating a gust of wind as he let out a roar and raised his right hand. It was as if he wanted to release all his anger at the incoming Money Rat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Money Rat’s ugly face revealed a disdainful frown before his mouth curved into a cruel smile. He stood there and watched Zhao Jiuge’s punch arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For an outsider, this punch looked very fast, but for Money Rat, who was using spirit force, it was very slow. The difference in strength was like a cat playing with a mouse. When the fist was close to his face, he let out a cold snort and there was a flash of dark blue light in his hand. He released his spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fist flashing with spirit force collided with Zhao Jiuge’s punch, relying purely on his physical body. Zhao Jiuge’s body was sent flying and he bent like a shrimp. The spirit force from Money Rat entered Zhao Jiuge’s body from his fist and began destroying his meridians. This caused Zhao Jiue’s face to reveal an expression of suffering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark blue spirit force smashed around inside his body. The spirit force inside his body finally weakened and his meridians were a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He spat out a mouthful of blood while in the air and fell to the ground. When he fell, he could clearly feel the entire stone chamber tremble slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su, who was still immersed in her own fantasy, was shocked out of it by this. She let out a hysterical scream. “JIU… GE…” Her voice was so loud, it echoed inside the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was fortunate that after cultivating the Sanskrit Divine Body, even without spirit force, his body was still pretty strong. The punch from Money Rat was messing with the internal meridians, but his outer appearance was not damaged. Enduring the pain, Zhao Jiuge clenched his teeth and got up. He let out another roar as he rushed toward Money Rat without any regard for his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? I don’t believe I can’t deal with you today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was so tenacious that he was able to get up as if nothing had happened, Money Rat couldn’t help but become angry!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two fists collided and, without any surprise, Zhao Jiuge was flying again. This time, he spasmed a bit as he fell to the ground and coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood. Then he stood up again and rushed toward Money Rat. However, his voice was obviously more hoarse this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another loud sound echoed. Money Rat’s mind was very perverse at this moment as he enjoyed the pleasure from beating Zhao Jiuge up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s eyes were wet as she helplessly cried and called for Jiuge. From her youth, she had always been held up high by others and had never been wronged like this. Su Su looked at Zhao Jiuge and couldn’t help but cry. She was ready to pounce at Zhao Jiuge to make him stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t expect Zhao Jiuge, who was knocked to the ground, to roll and get up once more. His whole face was a bloody mess and his handsome features could no longer be seen. He didn’t scream, he only muttered some words and then charged forward once more. His movement was slower, his response was slower, but what remained the same was his willingness to protect Su Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su was used to being willful and getting whatever she wanted, but now she was crying sorrowfully. She looked at Zhao Jiuge’s tragic figure through her teary eyes, and for the first time, she understood that things couldn’t always be the way she wanted them to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was sent flying again. Money Rat seemed to enjoy this perverted pleasure more and more as he revealed a smile with his ugly face. It was Daoist Yi Qing who was becoming more and more impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was holding his beard while frowning with an impatient face. He looked at this and shouted, “That’s enough. Stop playing and kill him, then throw him into the alchemy furnace. Take the jade pendant from his waist and see if there is anything else worthwhile. As for the girl, once we divide the things, you can play with her as you wish. After you finish, throw her into the alchemy furnace too to avoid any trouble in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Daoist Yi Qing’s words, Money Rat nodded and sneered. He glanced at Su Su’s beautiful body and then looked at Zhao Jiuge with a cold expression filled with killing intent. He walked up and prepared to deal the killing blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge was a bloody mess as he laid on the ground, gasping for air, his chest violently heaving up and down. He stared at the incoming Money Rat with a grievous gaze. He moved his five fingers but couldn’t do more, as his entire body was seriously damaged—he was unable to even stand up. His dried lips moved but no sound could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one got really close to Zhao Jiuge, they would be able to hear him say, “If you dare to touch Su Su, even if I die, I won’t let you go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge was filled with helplessness. It was as if he had returned to the afternoon where his grandpa left him. This moment was just like today; he was unable to protect the person he cared about! The dazzling, blue light appeared around Money Rat’s right hand and he no longer hesitated—he smashed his hand down with killing intent. However, the next second, his eyes were filled with shock as he found that he could not move his hand anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful aura suddenly surrounded the entire stone chamber!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, people as vicious and evil as you two best not delude yourself into thinking you can walk far along the path of cultivation. Most demonic cultivators have their own rules. People like you are not qualified to cultivate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold snort followed by some powerful words. Then an old man in a white robe suddenly appeared in the stone chamber. There was no trace of movement or any sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Money Rat found that no matter how much he tried to move, even if he used his full strength, he could not move an inch. He then even found that he could not use the spirit force inside his body either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Yi Qing was terrified. Who had entered the stone chamber without him even detecting a slight bit of their aura? He endured the fear in his heart and looked toward the source of the figure, then he was suddenly dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was wearing a white robe and his long hair was casually scattered behind his back. He carried a longsword on his back and had an ordinary-looking wine gourd on his waist. His eyes were extremely profound, and although he was old, his appearance still contained a certain charm. He must have been very handsome during his youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He casually floated in the air and his robe fluttered without any wind. Although he released no spirit force fluctuations, his temperament gave Daoist Yi Qing a lot of pressure. He also couldn’t see through the old man’s cultivation, and all of this just made Daoist Yi Qing feel more dread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Su saw the old man appear, she suddenly burst out into a smile. There were tears on her beautiful face, but she happily shouted, “Grandpa Yang, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man instantly appeared beside Su Su and lovingly looked at her. He rubbed Su Su’s head and softly said, “See if you dare to run away again. You think you can fool your father with just your skills? I have been secretly following you from the moment you left. I have followed you for several months already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Su’s pitiful and loving expression, the old man sighed. Then he gently said, “Now you know how sinister and dangerous the outside world is. See if you dare to stay so willful in the future. If I hadn’t been following you, something might have happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su revealed an embarrassed smile and had an apologetic look on her face. Then she suddenly thought of Zhao Jiuge and her face turned anxious. However, the old man unexpectedly revealed a gentle smile and teasingly said, “That boy is fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Su Su’s face became completely red and embarrassment was written all over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Su and the old man were talking, Daoist Yi Qing could no longer suppress the panic in his heart. He knew that things had reached a life-changing moment. Today, either he died or they died, and he decided to act first. Filled with panic, he grabbed the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd on his waist and injected spirit force into it, causing the gourd to shine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monstrous truefire turned into a long snake coiled in the air and spread out a powerful heatwave. The originally red alchemy furnace became even more red as the heatwave spread in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the injection of spirit force, the fire snake became even more robust and lively. It constantly twisted its body until it suddenly turned and rushed toward the white-robed old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man sensed the movement from Daoist Yi Qing while talking to Su Su. He didn’t care, but it disrupted their talk, which made him a bit unhappy. He frowned slightly, but his face was calm. There was no flashy light or large movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He casually waved his right hand and monstrous Purple God Thunder filled the entire stone chamber. The terrifying aura made it so Daoist Yi Qing could barely breathe. His eyes were open wide and he looked at the old man in shock. This cultivation far exceeded his understanding. After doing evil for so long, he had finally hit a metal plate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Purple God Thunder formed a net and pierced through the fire snake at an unimaginable speed. The fire snake just disappeared without a trace, then the net flew toward Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the purple thunder flying toward him, Daoist Yi Qing’s pupils shrank and he felt a terrifying pain, as if he was being stabbed all over his body. The veins on his forehead swelled and he clenched his teeth to use his full power to resist it. However, just as he thought of this, the thunder net surrounded his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A burning stench spread out. Grey smoke came from where Daoist Yi Qing was, but there was no Daoist Yi Qing. His entire body had been turned to smoke by the Purple God Thunder. Even his soul had been destroyed, leaving him no chance to reincarnate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-robed old man’s movement was so simple, swift, and decisive!</span></p>
