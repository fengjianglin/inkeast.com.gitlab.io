 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s shy smile froze and she shook her head at Zhao Jiuge’s question. Then her eyes lit up as she thought for a moment but wasn’t certain. “Could this… be related to the haunting. From these fluctuations, it must at least be a Foundation Realm cultivator.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, I know you’re in here. If you don’t want me to kill this entire village, then quickly come out!” A cold snort and voice echoed clearly throughout the village with the help of spirit force. It was filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were shocked. It was the familiar spirit fluctuations of the Corpse Gather Chant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s heart sank and he looked at Su Su. “Let’s go. If it's a blessing, it's not a curse, and if it's a curse, you can’t avoid it.” His voice was a bit hoarse from the excitement and his tone even changed a bit. However, compared to Zhao Jiuge, Su Su was particularly calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the families in the village had been awakened from this big movement, but none of them dared to come out to see what was happening. At this moment, all the lights in the village went out. The only thing that remained was darkness and silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Village entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The skinny old man wrapped in the black robe looked coldly at the young man and woman who had walked out. As the wind surged violently, the terrifying spirit force coming from his body created a powerful pressure that made it difficult to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the two good-looking youths who had extraordinary cultivation, the old man felt pain in his heart. He had his son very late and had spent a lot of effort to increase his son’s cultivation level to the Spirit Transformation Realm. He hadn’t expected his son to die soon after he went into closed door cultivation to form his spirit core! He wanted to reach the Spirit Core Realm before taking his son away from Dong Yang City to improve their cultivation and do as they wished in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, his short-lived son had been killed by the two of them. Because they cultivated an evil cultivation method, they had to worry about all the righteous people and stay recluse near a small place like Dong Yang City. They relied on his Foundation Realm cultivation to do as they wished here. The skinny and gloomy old man could no longer suppress his anger. “If this old man doesn’t refine your souls, I won’t be able to face my dead son!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His killing intent was monstrous and his cold words shook Zhao Jiuge’s heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the skinny and gloomy old man, Zhao Jiuge was surprised and his eyes were wide open. This old man was the one that had bought the Black Dragon Whip and then disappeared afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That day, when he saw the old man in his black robe, he felt very uncomfortable and goosebumps appeared all over his body. The old man’s eyes were like poisonous snakes. When he encountered the strange, skinny man, he felt like he was a bit familiar. It turned out he was this old man’s son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On that day on the second floor, Zhao Jiuge had asked Mo Longjie about those people because he was curious. This skinny old man was called Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, who cultivated using spiritual energy at night and the corpse aura from corpses. He was at the Foundation Realm. Although a lot of people didn’t like his methods, they were all afraid of his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a few magical treasures that were not bad, but his cultivation method was something others didn’t like, so he didn’t have any friends. Zhao Jiuge cursed at his back luck. Yesterday, if not for running away, he wouldn’t have run into the unmarked graves where the old man and his son were cultivating. Then the son wouldn’t have threatened to drain their essence blood, forcing him and Su Su to act. Otherwise, why would he go find people to kill that would lead to this old man chasing after him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Zhao Jiuge was secretly cursing, the old man could not hold back the grief and anger in his heart. Violent, blood-red spirit force surged out and wrapped the surroundings in a layer of blood red. The wildlife was all gone, leaving only the sound of leaves and branches shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying pressure made Zhao Jiuge and Su Su’s breathing difficult and heavy. Light gold and milky white light surged out to protect their bodies. At this moment, the three different colors shined outside this small village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge took one step forward to protect Su Su, his golden spirit light surging. “Let me, you’re no match for him.” Before Su Su could finish speaking, Zhao Jiuge had already moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first to move would hold the upper hand. Zhao Jiuge was not one to shrink from a fight. Since the hatred came from killing the old man’s son, this battle was unavoidable. Then it was better for him to get the first move. Golden spirit force wrapped around his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sword formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden sword light continued to grow brighter and its momentum surged. It flew forward, creating a wave of spirit force like a waterfall. It instantly arrived before the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no flashy light or large ripples, it was only a cold snort. The Ten Thousand Corpse Elder flicked his finger and a ball of blood-colored light the size of a grain of rice flew into the dazzling, golden, sword light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no heaven-shaking collision when the two collided, the sword light simply melted like snow. The sword light disappeared, followed by the blood-colored grain. The difference in spirit force between someone at the late stage of the Foundation Realm and someone at the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm was like heaven and earth. The strike that had taken all his effort had been countered with but a flick from the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a mouthful of foul air, and anger gradually appeared in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes. Yesterday, his blue longsword had been destroyed and the only thing he had left was the Li Fire Flag. He clenched his teeth as an overbearing roar of a dragon echoed. A golden dragon several meters long hovered above Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was surprised by the golden dragon’s appearance, but he was merely surprised for a moment before returning to indifference. He raised his right hand and spirit force gathered to form a blood-colored sword in an instant. At the Foundation Realm, one would be constantly absorbing spiritual energy to convert to spirit force like crazy, even when not cultivating. That was because at the Foundation Realm, the formation inside your dantian would be complete to automatically absorb spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge needed time to condense that sword light, but the old man could do it in an instant. With a wave of his right hand, a plain-looking sword light flew toward the golden light. The blood-colored sword flew across the night sky like a river of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden dragon now was not only more corporal, but even a little larger. The scales of the golden dragon were very lifelike and emitted a faint, golden glow. Seeing the sword close in, the dragon’s eyes lit up, but it held no fear as it pounced forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden dragon’s tail smashed down into the blood-colored sword from above and then splattered into the trees below. The golden dragon’s body became dim and it looked like it could dissipate at any moment. There was even the same grey smoke around its body like yesterday, but it was much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden dragon let out a painful roar and rolled its body. It clawed frantically at the smoke around its body, and the air was filled with the smell of blood. The old man didn’t think the sword would be struck down like that, so the result surprised him greatly. However, this didn’t change his plan for revenge—he was still filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge cursed in his mind, but his eyes were filled with battle intent. Today, he had smashed into a metal plate. He was roaring and raging in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Power! Power! Power!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throughout his youth, he had been bullied in the village. Then he helplessly stepped onto the path of cultivation, but he was still bullied by others. He yearned for strength—he had to cultivate more because he was no longer willing to be stepped upon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light flashed before him—it was the Li Fire Flag! Madness appeared in his eyes as he clenched his teeth. He ignored the injuries from yesterday that he had just recovered from and activated the Li Fire Flag!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Woosh, woosh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A monstrous fire surged, expelling the blood-thirsty and gloomy aura. The dancing fire made Zhao Jiuge’s heart feel a little better. The old man was startled when he saw the Li Fire, then his face became twisted and cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t expect this little boy to bring about so much surprise. The old man no longer wanted to waste more time and he began muttering some words. A cloth banner half a person long appeared from the void. The blackish-grey flag was covered in strong yin energy and had grey gas surrounding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky was suddenly filled with dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the silver moon silently hid behind the dark clouds. The old man’s hands quickly formed seals and his chanting became faster. The blackish grey banner hummed from its vibrations as if something was going to break free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge stared at the strange banner with a silly expression. The strange and terrifying movement made him forget to inject spirit force into the Li Fire Flag. Su Su had a serious expression as she stared at this, and when she saw the banner vibrate, her eyes filled with shock. “Quickly! Stop him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Su Su’s shout, Zhao Jiuge returned to his senses and quickly injected spirit force into the Li Fire Flag. The fire turned into a few fire dragons and charged toward the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was too late!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shocking scene unfolded. The head of a woman with a ferocious face appeared. Her hair was a mess, her skin was grey, and blood was still bleeding out from her orifices. She appeared with nine different babies with the same gloomy aura. At this moment, the color of the moon dimmed greatly and dark clouds gathered above the banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unspeakable sense of panic and gloominess caused Zhao Jiuge’s scalp to feel numb. He had never seen such a shocking scene in his life. The woman’s head and the nine babies were whimpering as they circled around the banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt goosebumps cover his entire body and he even felt his heart stop for a moment as his pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s chest was heaving up and down as she looked at this cruel and strange scene. Even her pleasant voice became shrill and her face was filled with disbelief. “How could you fine the Nine Sons Mother Banner!? It’s such a despicable magic treasure, you heartless monster! You’re an animal!”</span></p>
