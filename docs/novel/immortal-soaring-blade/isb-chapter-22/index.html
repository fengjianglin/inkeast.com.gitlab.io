 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to the room, Zhao Jiuge recalled what happened today and his mood became a bit unstable. At the same time, he felt a sense of pressure. After a long time, he let out a big breath and his eyes lit up. The path of cultivation was already difficult; if he couldn’t even handle a small matter like the Xiao family, how would he be able to cultivate in the future? He clenched his fists—no one was going to stop him from walking down the path of cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was going to consolidate his cultivation tonight, and once he returned tomorrow, he was going to focus on cultivating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he got on the bed and sat down. After he slowly calmed his mood, he entered a cultivation state. He then closed his eyes and the surroundings became quiet. The spiritual energy in the world around him slowly became visible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It appeared out of thin air and gently circled around him before going into his body. After entering his body, the spiritual energy turned into spirit force through his cultivation method. The spirit force flowed through his body and made its way into his dantian. Inside the dantian, the smiling buddha was there with the golden dragon below it. Once spirit force started to flow in, the golden dragon gradually opened its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A joyous dragon roar echoed inside his body, and it began to absorb the spirit force. The golden dragon became brighter and its body grew larger as it absorbed the spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the room, Zhao Jiuge’s breathing became stable and the spiritual energy slowly moved in a repeating cycle. His cultivation level was slowly increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The morning sunlight shone through the gap in the window and onto the youth who was cultivating. Thinking about how he had promised Mo Linger that he would go shopping with her, he couldn’t help but feel helpless. He revealed a gentle smile and shook his head as he got off the bed. He slowly stretched his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Linger’s happy and crisp voice came from the door. “Big Brother Jiuge, have you awakened yet?” Zhao Jiuge opened the door and saw Mo Linger’s happy smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little girl, you are so early.” Zhao Jiuge revealed a bitter smile and then his eyes lit up. He looked at the little girl who was a head shorter than him wearing a pale yellow dress that gave off a lively and youthful aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun that had just risen bathed the entire Mo mansion in sunlight, and the two of them were in a good mood. They laughed and talked as they left the Mo mansion, greeting some people from the Mo family on the way out. Some people curiously looked at them with strange gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the distance, Zheng Jie, who was patrolling, looked at Zhao Jiuge with a gloomy expression. He couldn’t hide the jealousy in his eyes. Zheng Jie had always been an ambitious person and wanted to make a name for himself in the Mo family. In fact, he had done this, and he had enjoyed the Mo family’s resources to reach the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm. He also followed Mo Linger all day. However, after Zhao Jiuge arrived, everything changed. He secretly thought about something and seemed to make up his mind as he went toward Mo Longje’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people of Dong Yang City had all awakened early, so the bustling atmosphere was already there. The brick road had pot holes all over, but it didn’t affect the flow of people in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them leisurely strolled the streets of Dong Yang city. Mo Linger ran from stall to stall like a happy, little sparrow looking at the various decorative items they had. She seemed to have completely forgotten about Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge rolled his eyes and felt helpless. He then looked at his own clothes. This was the first time someone had made clothes for him. Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge also began carefully looking through the stalls. He was thinking of what gift to get Mo Linger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt a headache coming on. He had never been in this kind of situation before, so he was feeling helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, it's Little Sister Linger. I didn’t expect to meet you here, what a coincidence.” A crisp voice echoed beside Mo Linger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Linger’s delicate brows wrinkled and she looked toward the sound of the voice. There was a group of people coming over from the crowd, and at the center was a well-dressed young man with a handsome face that was somewhat sickly pale. It was Xiong Yikang from the auction house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his eyes were filled with passion and undisguised longing, as well as some hidden ill-intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Mo Linger saw Xiong Yikang, she ignored him and turned toward Zhao Jiuge. Seeing Mo Linger walk away, Xiong Yikang became a little anxious and quickly caught up to her. “Little Sister Linger, where are you going? I happen to have nothing to do and can accompany you. If there is anything you like, I’ll give it to you.” Xiong Yikang looked at the girl before him. Although she was still little, there was a certain charm to her. He subconsciously swallowed as he looked at the delicate face before him that was causing his eyes to become filled with passion. He also wanted to hug the big tree that was the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Xiong Yikang’s face, Mo Linger felt a wave of disgust. Xiong Yikang was a famous playboy in Dong Yang City, but due to her family’s good teaching, she forced out a smile. “Oh, it's Young Master Xiong. I still have things to do, so I won’t accompany you.” Xiong Yikang tried his best to make himself look modest. Normally, thanks to his face and family background, he would never have to do this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he took a bracelet that was a magic treasure. The bracelet let off faint spirit force fluctuations. “Oh, in that case, Little Sister Linger, you go ahead, but you have to accept this bracelet.” Xiong Yikang believed that no one could turn down an expensive, jade bracelet like this. Women had no control over their vanity, and they always ended up in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he tried his best to look humble, but he could not help but leak out a little pride. He raised his head in a sense of superiority and stared at Mo Linger unblinkingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Xiong Yikang’s appearance, Mo Linger felt helpless and wanted to gag. Just because she was young, that didn’t mean she was stupid, not to mention she had been educated by the Mo family since young. Feeling disgusted, she was about to reject Xiong Yikang when Zhao Jiuge stood before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master, my little sister doesn’t need your things. If she wants anything, as her big brother, I’ll get it for her.” After he finished speaking, he grabbed Mo Linger’s delicate hand and placed an extremely ordinary jade bracelet onto her wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he rubbed her hair and said, “If you have any difficulty in the future, just tell me. I will always treat you like my own little sister.” His eyes were filled with the love a brother would have for his sister as he pulled her away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Linger was initially very happy when she saw that Zhao Jiuge had brought her a gift, and a big smile appeared on her face. Then she heard Zhao Jiuge’s words and couldn’t help but become crestfallen. She muttered to herself depressingly, “Just as a little sister?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop. I was wondering who it was. It turns out to be the wild child who the Xiao family was going to deal with.” When Xiong Yikang saw this youth suddenly pull Mo Linger’s hand, his eyes almost shot out fire. “What quality do you have? You might not even live until next month.” Then he arrogantly gauged Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t get far when he heard Xiong Yikang’s words, and was too lazy to even reply when he heard the second half. He stopped and turned around. “If you stay one more thing, I’ll make you go back home lying down before all these people here, and you’ll see what I’m made of.” His words were still calm and held no emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiong Yikang’s actions became stiff after hearing Zhao Jiuge’s calm words and seeing his cold face. Just as he was about to continue speaking, he felt the spirit force surging from Zhao Jiuge. Xiong Yikang suddenly closed his mouth and his eyes filled with shock as he stared at Zhao Jiuge’s eyes, which were now filled with killing intent. At this moment, Xiong Yikang didn’t doubt that if he dared to talk more, Zhao Jiuge would really deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His guards around him felt the pressure and all took a few steps back. Xiong Yikang felt impressed and also scolded these useless people in his heart. He couldn’t help but feel angry as the sound of ridicule and people talking about him echoed. His handsome face seemed even more pale, and he blamed all this on Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The standoff lasted for a few seconds, and after seeing Xiong Yikang remain silent, Zhao Jiuge felt bored. He pulled Mo Linger and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhao Jiuge and Mo Linger were a bit far away, Xiong Yikang continued to gloomily stare in their direction. When he noticed that there were still people around, he pretended to look vicious and loudly said, “Hmph, you’re merely a wild child. Next month, the Xiao family will deal with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the way back, Zhao Jiuge continued to educate Mo Linger to not associate herself with people like that, and Mo Linger just obediently nodded. Zhao Jiuge seriously said, “Remember, from now on, you are my little sister. No matter who bullies you, I’ll stand up for you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Zhao Jiuge stress the words “little sister,” she pouted and started unhappily muttering something, but in her heart, she felt like she had eaten honey. As Zhao Jiuge walked up, she was secretly smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning the corner, Zhao Jiuge suddenly turned around with doubt in his eyes, highly vigilant. However, he didn’t find anything. “What’s wrong, Big Brother Jiuge?” Mo Linger asked after seeing Zhao Jiuge’s strange movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When we came out, I felt like someone was following me, but then I thought I was wrong. However, just now, I felt something only to turn and see nothing.” He shook his head in confusion and no longer thought about it as he brought Mo Linger back to the Mo mansion. He could only assume that it was the Xiao family or that playboy, Xiong Yikang, sending someone to follow him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after the two of them left, a beautiful, young girl walked out of a stall. She stared at the corner that Zhao Jiuge had disappeared into for a long time but didn’t follow.</span></p>
