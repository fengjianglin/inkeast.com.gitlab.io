 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forging a flying sword not only required a good sword embryo, but also a lot of materials. Aside from some special materials, like the Fantasy Silver Sand, most of the remaining materials were different types of ores. The quality of the ores would determine the quality of the flying sword forged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many different types of treasures. Functional ones didn’t require a lot of spirit ores. The ones that needed a lot were armor and weapons. These two types of treasures were also very precious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ores used to make these kinds of treasures accounted for almost half their cost. One could imagine just how expensive these ores were. When they heard Han Songcheng say that there was a small mine of it below Fallen Leaf Mountain, how could they not be surprised? Although it was a small mine, there would still be a lot! Even just a few kilograms of this material could be sold at markets and auction houses for a large sum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhao Jiuge wondered how many kilograms of ore would be inside this small mine, his mouth subconsciously opened. Unlike Zhao Jiuge, who can only think about numbers, there was a flash of almost undetectable emotion in Bai Qingqing’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know how precious Purple Ji Spirit Stone was, but Bai Qingqing had learned about it when she was young, so she knew how valuable it was. When refining a treasure, adding a few kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone could improve the quality of a treasure by a lot. It could be considered one of the top materials for refining treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing, who never cared about material things, felt her heart burn with passion. She didn’t expect to encounter this kind of material that you could desire but not obtain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then quickly take us there!” Bai Qingqing said impatiently, and her furrowed eyebrows unknowingly relaxed. Due to her excitement, her chest heaved up and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge became silly from joy. He planned to refine treasures when he went back; he never expected the materials to be delivered to him. A flying sword was expensive because of the cost of the sword embryo, so he could only put it aside for now. Aside from the Blue Plum Sword, he had no defensive treasures. This time, he was going to refine a good defensive treasure when he got back. With his sect contributions, he could only buy a common magic treasure, so it was better to test his luck and refine his own. Perhaps he would get a high-grade one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I’ll take you two there now. After I take you two there, return my treasure and let me leave. I don’t care about the rest.” The weakened Han Songcheng’s eyes shined when he felt that Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge were satisfied. He felt the pain from his injuries reduce a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mhmm.” Bai Qingqing calmly agreed with a sound, but there was a flash of intent hidden deep in her eyes. Han Songcheng didn’t notice this, but Zhao Jiuge did. Although he didn’t know what Bai Qingqing intended to do, he understood that she had her own reasons. Since he didn’t understand, he was not going to think about it, but he would naturally know soon enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng struggled to get up. He ignored his injuries as he revealed a smile and acted respectfully. He bowed and pointed toward the courtyard. “Inside here, I have a secret passage inside my room to the bottom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You go first, lead the way. I’ll tell you now, if you play any tricks, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance.” Bai Qingqing’s face was stern, holding the Wind Flower Sword tightly in her hand. She had recovered about 20% of her spirit force from the pill. If not for this, she would not follow Han Songcheng to some unknown place without any spirit force. After all, Han Songcheng was too treacherous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll do whatever you guys say. I accidentally found this mine. You both know I have done many evil deeds, and sometimes it's inevitable to encounter people who are difficult to deal with, people with strong backgrounds. I fear retaliation from them, so I secured my nest. But this wasn’t enough, so I decided to create a secret passage to escape. Thus, I began digging down to the bottom of the mountain, but I unexpectedly found a mine of Purple Ji Spirit Stone there. I didn’t know what it was or how valuable it was. In order to know its value, I went to some black markets and auctions around the area and learned it was called Purple Ji Spirit Stone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng paused for a moment then continued, “I was very happy to have found a mine of it and felt like I was going to be rich. I took some and sold it to the auction house for tens of thousands of spirit stones. I knew I made a loss, but I didn’t care. However, I was tailed on my way back. I broke out in cold sweat and knew that I had shown off too much. Fortunately, the other party’s cultivation was not strong. After coming back, I never went to the mine again. Later, I used the spirit stones to buy that illusion formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng slowly led the way and patiently explained the situation. He was afraid the two of them would not believe him, so he put on a very sincere appearance on the surface. Secretly, he continued trying to use his spirit force and found that his meridians had loosened a bit. This made him try even more, but his pace became even slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A human’s heart was sinister, and neither Zhao Jiuge nor Bai Qingqing believed Han Songcheng’s words. They didn’t care if he was telling the truth, it was not important. They were just interested in seeing if that small mine of Purple Ji Spirit Stone was still there or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They entered the inner courtyard. It was made of rocks mined from the mountain. There were no excessive decorations or designs, it had a simple style. Han Songcheng led them into the innermost area that belonged to him. Then they entered his secret chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the bedroom filled with luxury furniture and paintings, Han Songcheng walked up to the redwood bed. He gently reached out to the wooden disk at the head of the bed and turned it slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Click.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then a bookcase automatically separated into two, revealing a small, dark space behind it. One could vaguely see that the small room was cluttered with items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were inside the bedroom and were holding their flying swords. They were vigilant and a bit hesitant about facing the unknown. They watched Han Songcheng as he was about to enter the secret room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge quickly shouted, “Stop, don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Han Songcheng immediately became motionless. He embarrassedly smiled and said, “This… Didn’t you two want me to take the lead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We told you to lead the way, but not so fast. Wait for us before leading the way.” Zhao Jiuge immediately walked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he turned toward Bai Qingqing and said, “I’ll take the front, you stay behind me. Be careful.” After he finished speaking, he followed Han Songcheng into the small chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering, the scent of wet soil rushed into his nose. Zhao Jiuge wrinkled his nose and was on guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, a burst of water-blue light came from behind. The source was Bai Qingqing’s Wind Flower Sword. At this moment, the narrow chamber became visible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a room a bit over 12 dozen square meters. There were stacks of common magic treasures, which must have been stolen. Beside that was a stack of about six to seven thousand spirit tones. When Zhao Jiuge saw this, his eyes lit up. Han Songcheng noticed and immediately said, “That’s mine, you guys will have the spirit stone mine. Quickly, over there.” After he finished speaking, he pointed to the right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A grey, stone door a few meters wide with a simple Tai Chi pattern carved on it—this had to be the path leading to the bottom of the mountain. Perhaps Han Songcheng was afraid they would eye the stuff in his secret room, so he quickly changed the topic to the mine. However, Zhao Jiuge only took a look before withdrawing his gaze, while Bai Qingqing didn’t even look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Move quickly, don’t stall and don’t play any tricks,” Zhao Jiuge said impatiently as he pointed the Blue Plum Sword at the grey, stone door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng immediately smiled and nodded. He quickly rushed forward and pushed open the stone door. Since he couldn’t use his spirit force, it took some effort. The moment his back was to them, the smile disappeared and his expression turned gloomy. The viciousness he always had returned to his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the door was the belly of Fallen Leaf Mountain. There was a winding path inside. The area mined out was very wide, and one could see the strange rock patterns on the wall. After entering, it was obvious it was very wet, and the temperature dropped a bit. The stone road had water permeating it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng slowly walked in front and Zhao Jiuge slowly followed. He stared carefully at Han Songcheng’s every move. The last person was Bai Qingqing, who was looking at the surroundings. As for Han Songcheng’s sneaky attempts to use his spirit force, Bai Qingqing simply didn’t care. If she didn’t even fear a peak-condition Han Songcheng, why would she fear him now that he was seriously injured? What she had to be on guard for was the strange surroundings and for any surprises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them walked down the winding path that continued heading down and would occasionally go up. The air became even more humid the more they walked. Zhao Jiuge didn’t know if they had reached the foot of the mountain or not. He could only remain vigilant and follow Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after almost half an hour, the stone road began to dry up. Then, at a fork in the road, Han Songcheng stopped walking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing only coldly looked at Han Songcheng and waited for him to speak. Although they knew they had likely arrived, they still held their swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re here. A dozen meters or so forward to the left is the Purple Ji Spirit Stone mine and to the right is the escape route I built. Since I’ve brought you two to the mine, I’ll leave first. As for the rest, do as you wish.” Han Songcheng was filled with ill intent. On the way here, he was finally able to use spirit force despite his serious injuries. After he spoke, Han Songcheng took the lead and walked toward the left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing closely followed. After walking about a dozen meters, they entered a circular opening that was a few square meters in size. Purple light shined on Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s shocked faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The opening that was only a few square meters wide was covered in purple crystals. These crystals had many sides, so they were particularly bright. The light they gave off dyed the area purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw that there was really a Purple Ji Spirit Stone mine before him, he felt his heart pound rapidly. He looked around and roughly estimated that there were more than 500 kilograms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about how he was going to be able to refine his first treasures, Zhao Jiuge’s heart burst with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The happiness came too suddenly.</span></p>
