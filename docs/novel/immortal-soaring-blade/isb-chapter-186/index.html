 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Most of them were new disciples or outer disciples, so they had never seen such a powerful spell. Even the inner disciples were shocked and secretly guessed her identity. After all, ordinary people wouldn’t have such powerful spells!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing smiled, the water-blue spirit force suddenly began to churn. When the waves began to surge, small vortexes appeared. The waves smashed down upon Luo Bowen’s group one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen and company’s attitudes changed greatly, fear appearing in their eyes. Even Chen Gang was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bown looked at the incoming wave, clenched his teeth, and shouted, “Everyone, attack at once to break this strange tide.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the silver flying sword in his hand shined brightly. His roar and the light from his flying sword had awakened everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eight rays of light appeared—the first layer of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art. All nine of them decided to use the same attack. Aside from Luo Bowen’s ray of sword energy, which shot out ahead, the remaining eight flew out together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rays of silver sword energy were much faster than the incoming blue waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rays of sword energy instantly cut into the waves, but when they come into contact, the waves merely rippled to the sides a bit. Then they continued forward in full force as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen’s heart tightened. He was holding a spirit treasure-grade flying sword from his family. Although it wasn’t the best, it was still a spirit treasure. His full-strength attack hadn’t even damaged the blue wave—it was like throwing a small pebble into the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what happened next made Luo Bowen involuntarily open his mouth and look at the sky in shock. The blue wave continued to magnify before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was shocked at first because his own attack had only caused a little splash, but then he saw that the remaining eight rays of silver sword energy didn’t even cause a splash. They all just disappeared into the wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Luo Bowen’s shocked expression, Bai Qingqing’s mouth curved up into a smile of ridicule. If The Blue Tide Rises was a simple attack that could be easily broken, would it become her family’s most famous spell?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of waves crashing and the chilly wave continued to close in. The quick-witted Luo Bowen quickly shouted, “Sword energy is useless, try to see if we can resist it with spirit force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Luo Bowen was anxiously shouting, he didn’t remain idle—spirit force surged from his body. A layer of green spirit force firmly surrounded his body like armor. He was going to protect himself first. He had seen Bai Qingqing’s tyrannical power and didn’t want to lie in a bed recovering for a few months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then his spirit force gathered before his chest into a giant, green palm to rush the wave. The eight figures behind him materialized fists or palms to stop this strange wave as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, while the nine people’s eyes were filled with passion and hope, their spirit force collided with the blue waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen’s green spirit force cut into the blue waves first and suddenly created an opening inside the waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The waves obviously weakened a little. When Luo Bowen saw that this was effective, he secretly felt relieved. The unknown was the most terrifying. He was not afraid of power, but he was afraid of not being able to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the other eight spirit forces collided with the wave, causing the previously surging wave to calm down. The water-blue light simmed and then dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before they could sigh in relief, they were filled with fear. After the first wave was stopped, another wave surged behind it, and another behind that. One after the other, the waves were endless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The waves directly surrounded the nine of them, and their figures immediately disappeared. One could only see the waves surging up and down like a ribbon fluttering in the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of the waves crashing slowly faded until it disappeared completely. At the same time, the magnificent scene of the blue tide slowly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the water-blue light completely dissipated, Luo Bowen, Chen Gang, and the rest of them appeared once more. They didn’t seem to have suffered any injuries and only a few of them were sitting on the ground. Chen Gang and Luo Bowen maintained their postures, but the spirit force around the nine of them had completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s gazes were filled with different emotions. Some showed panic, some showed doubt, and some showed shock. They all checked their physical condition to find no injuries at all, but their spirit force was dried up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang and Luo Bowen looked at each other. They both came from influential families, so they had some insight. They knew that the Hua Xia Dynasty had all kinds of strange cultivation methods and spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Bowen swallowed hard and looked at Bai Qingqing profoundly, then he clasped his hands and smiled bitterly. “I’m utterly defeated, I admire you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he walked down the mountain. It seemed like he had turned and walked away casually, but his heart was completely shocked. Moreso than other people, he knew exactly how extraordinary this spell was. Even with his family’s background, they didn’t have such a powerful spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest quickly got up. They looked somewhat lost and dejectedly followed Luo Bowen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was silent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defeat of the Mysterious Strange Peak had brought about cheers from the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples, but everyone was silent right now. When they saw Bai Qingqing defeat the nine disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak in one move, they couldn’t help but suck in breaths of cold air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, there was the madman Zhao Jiuge, and now there was Bai Qingqing, who was even more abnormal than Zhao Jiuge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak weren’t the only ones confused, even the disciples of the other two peaks were filled with doubt. What had happened just now? Only those with profound cultivation understood what that attack had done. When the wave surrounded a person, it would extract their spirit force. No matter how strong your spells or treasures were, if you didn’t have the spirit force to use them, what could you do? Also, this spell had more to it, but Bai Qingqing was only able to use this effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge were the only two people left on the top of Wu Hua Peak. This time, the Mysterious Heaven Peak was the sole winner. When the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak saw this, they all erupted in cheers. This was not only because the Mysterious Heaven Peak had suppressed the other peak, but also because they were able to see such an amazing battle. It had shown them that one person could fight a group, and they didn’t think a battle could go like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now the Foundation Ream disciples of the other two peaks were all defeated, and even if a few had escaped, it wouldn’t be enough to turn the situation around.</span></p>

Just at this moment, the silence above Wu Hua Peak was broken by the sound of wind. The situation kept changing and one wave came after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stepped slightly forward and reached for Bai Qingqing’s shoulder to prevent her from falling. She must have paid a heavy price to use such a heaven-defying spell. It would take some time for her to recover back to peak condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked toward the location of the sound. Zhao Jiuge had originally calmed down, but now his heart fluctuated once more, his brows rose, and his eyes narrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peak of the nameless mountain not far away from Wu Hua Peak was equally lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the arrival of the Dawn Wind Elder, the atmosphere had become a little oppressive and the eight people here hadn’t made a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after Bai Qingqing eliminated the Mysterious Fallen Peak in one strike, Du Jun, who had a gloomy expression because his disciples were all seriously injured, suddenly smiled. He felt better and laughed at someone else’s misfortune. “Oh, someone earlier was ridiculing me about how I can’t teach my disciples because they lost in a 12-against-three battle and because all of them were seriously injured. Have you taught your disciples any better, now? All nine were defeated by one move, but they really are strong—they weren’t injured at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Jun spoke with a strange tone and finally laughed out loud. At first he thought he had some good seedlings and that he would be able to suppress the Mysterious Heaven Peak this time. In the end, he had lifted a stone and smashed his own feet. He was mocked by Zhang Xu, and Jian Wuxian’s silence hurt the most. Now the tables had turned and Zhang Xu could have a taste as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Xu let out a cold snort and turned his head. He didn’t argue with Du Jun. After all, he had lost a lot of face already, not to mention the elder was still here. However, Jian Wuxuan and Jian Xuxie both had big smiles on their faces. After all, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing had earned the Mysterious Heaven Peak a lot of face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dawn Wind Elder’s face changed somewhat when he saw Bai Qingiqng use that spell. Finally, he shook his head and sighed. “Let’s go, there is nothing left to see. The big picture is set. I came with high spirits and am leaving in disappointment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, the Dawn Wind Elder disappeared. He didn’t care about everyone’s reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxuan was surprised by the Dawn Wind Elder’s disappearance and asked, “Senior Brother, what’s wrong with the Dawn Wind Elder? Wasn’t he fine just a moment ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian looked at the top of Wu Hua Peak with a profound gaze as he was thinking about something. After a while, he didn’t answer his junior brother’s question but instead said, “Junior Brother, do you know why my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect has been doing poorly recently? The core reason why the sect is falling? Although we have a lot of top disciples, we don’t have many mid-level disciples!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxuan wasn’t the only one who was confused—everyone else was confused as well. They all remained silent and waited for Jian Wuxian to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect was, after all, their home. Even if there was internal conflict, it was still a fight within the family. Facing the long-term problems of the sect, even Du Jun and Zhang Xu showed worry and concern!</span></p>
