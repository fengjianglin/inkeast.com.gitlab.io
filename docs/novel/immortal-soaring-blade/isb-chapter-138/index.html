 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

The vortex in his dantian rotated rapidly and absorbed the spiritual energy from the spirit vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, Zhao Jiuge felt like something was wrong. As he absorbed spiritual energy, it felt like ants were crawling through his body, then the ants turned into needles stabbing his body. Then it became a heart-wrenching pain that filled his entire body. The temperature here was very low, but Zhao Jiuge’s body was covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out a muffled groan. He endured the pain and continued to absorb spiritual energy. Strength couldn’t be obtained for free—only when he paid the price would he obtain something in return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he absorbed spiritual energy, he found that there was ice blue fog mixed inside it. However, when the Sanskirt Heart Sutra converted the spiritual energy into spirit force, the ice blue fog was not converted, which Zhao Jiuge found very strange. One of the reasons to temper himself in here was to absorb this special attribute!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was a bit shocked, but he used the Sanskrit Heart Sutra to absorb the cold energy. After he did that, he shivered. What he felt was a bone-piercing kind of coldness and pain. Zhao Jiuge finally knew why some people could only last one or two days in here. This kind of pain was not something ordinary people could endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The effect that accompanied the pain was very obvious. After the small amount of blue fog was absorbed, Zhao Jiuge found a hint of ice blue energy mixed with his spirit force. Although it was small, it was there. Zhao Jiuge was excited—he found that this tempering was a painful and joyous experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was not afraid of pain, he was afraid of not being able to increase his strength. As long as he could increase his strength, he could persevere through anything. Originally, his face was distorted from the pain, but now he was smiling. This contrast made him look a bit strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge felt that trace of cold energy mix with his spirit force, he became decisive. He surrounded the blue fog inside his body and absorbed it. Each time he did so, he felt intense pain that made his heart tremble, but when he felt the cold energy increase, he became even more motivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fact that he could feel his strength obviously increasing, Zhao Jiuge would have escaped this place and screamed with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge repeatedly absorbed the ice blue fog. Cultivating here was only half the effort compared to normal, and the cold energy inside his dantian continued to grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, two days, and soon three days passed. There was a layer of ice-blue fog mixed with his spirit force. This layer of fog slowly rotated inside his dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had already noticed this, but he didn’t want to stop here. After slowing down a bit to adjust his mentality, he began once more. The large amount of ice blue fog filled every part of his body. What he wanted to do was fill his entire body with this cold energy. By doing so, not only could he temper his physique, he could also increase his cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was never an indecisive person. Once he had this idea, he quickly put it into action. He quickly mixed the cold energy with his spirit force and cycled it through his body. The numbing pain that he felt three days ago stimulated his nerves once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s entire body trembled. He was in so much pain that he wanted to die. His determination loosened, and he wanted to give up. However, when the word “strength” appeared in his heart, those thoughts were quickly erased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out a muffled roar and clenched his teeth while he endured. As time passed, Zhao Jiuge’s body was slowly being tempered and his spirit force was changing—it was obviously growing. Zhao Jiuge’s body was stiff, and the heart-wrenching coldess had already made his whole body numb. The only thought in his mind was that the longer he endured, the stronger he would become. As for anything else he didn’t care, just knowing that he was getting stronger was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the spirit force inside Zhao Jiuge’s body contained a layer of cold spirit force. It was like a thin layer of blue fog, and Zhao Jiuge’s body was still being slowly refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed extraordinarily fast during cultivation. Zhao Jiuge didn’t feel it, but outside, Instructor Zhou was very anxious. He was at the edge of the spirit vein, at the place he had separated from Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been more than half a month since Zhao Jiuge had gone into the spirit vein to temper his body. At first, Instructor Zhou was very happy, as the longer Zhao Jiuge stayed inside, the better the tempering. However, it had been more than half a month, which caused Instructor Zhou to worry and wonder if any accidents had occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit vein was a very important part of the sect and was protected by a formation. Thus, Instructor Zhou couldn’t send his divine sense inside to check on Zhao Jiuge. He could only anxiously wait here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the Cold Sky Sword Spirit Vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was sitting on the ground, motionless. When he occasionally breathed, his breath was filled with cold energy. Zhao Jiuge’s entire body was filled with this cold energy, and his spirit force was mixed with the cold attribute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhao Jiuge persisted, every part of his body had been tempered by the spirit force here. Due to the intense pain, his entire body was numb. When he wanted to move, his body didn’t respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A moment later, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes suddenly opened and started shining. After moving his limbs a bit, he observed his own body, then his eyes were filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body had made an obvious qualitative leap. The spirit force in his dantian exuded an ice-blue fog, and all the spirit force inside his body now contained the cold attribute. Although the cold energy was somewhat sparse, he was still only at the Foundation Realm. This tempering would only pave the way and leave a seed for the future. The effect of a spirit vein was much more than just this. Once his cultivation level increased, the benefits of tempering his body inside a spirit vein would slowly reveal themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the cold energy inside his body was not obvious, he could still cultivate this cold energy. He moved his body a bit and then stood up—he felt like he was filled with energy. After taking the Blue Spirit Bill and being tempered at the spirit vein, he reached the mid stage of the Foundation Realm. Zhao Jiuge felt very happy but also worried at the same time. &nbsp;His cultivation level was increasing very fast, and he didn’t know if this would cause his foundation to become unstable. He knew that spirit pills and heavenly treasures could only be occasionally used at the appropriate times. If he used too much, the cracks in his foundation would show once his cultivation level was higher. Zhao Jiuge didn’t understand any of this too well, so he could only feel worried. He reminded himself to properly cultivate after this and consolidate his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two golden dragons had not completely recovered after battling the Three-Tailed Yin Cat. They had made no movement even when he was tempering himself inside the spirit vein. The laughing Buddha was still motionless, but he found that its body had become even stronger. Zhao Jiuge’s harvest here was great—no wonder Instructor Zhou had said it was a rare opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou was still filled with worry in the underground stone room outside the spirit vein. Today was the 28th day since Zhao Jiuge had gone inside to temper his body. Instructor Zhou was feeling anxious, but he didn’t dare to pace around, because the black-robed elder was here guarding the spirit vein. He was afraid of disturbing this elder. He decided that after waiting for two more days, even at the risk of disturbing Zhao Jiuge, he was going to go inside to check on the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, I checked a few days ago. The little fellow is doing well.” Although the black-robed elder had his eyes closed, he spoke to comfort Instructor Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Zhou responded with shock, but he also relaxed. The elder’s cultivation level was more than just one or two realms higher than his, so the elder could detect things he couldn’t detect. Since the elder had said so, there should be no problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, light footsteps came from the stairs below. Instructor Zhou became very happy and looked toward the stone steps. He saw Zhao Jiuge walk up. Zhao Jiuge’s entire person seemed to have undergone a change, but he couldn’t say what was different.</span></p>

Did you temper yourself for the whole time?”&nbsp;</span></p>

Not only had Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation made a small breakthrough, even his body had changed. It seemed like he really had spent nearly a month tempering his body. The longer you temper your body, the better the effect. It has to be said that the disciple that had tempered their body the longest before this was Bai Qingqing, and she had only spent half a month there. Zhao Jiuge had taken twice as much time!</span></p>

We can speak after we leave the spirit vein. We shouldn’t disturb the elder’s cultivation.</span></p>

His character is indeed good, such perseverance. Zhao Jiuge, ah, Zhao Jiuge, I’m more and more curious about what kind of shocking performance you will display during the inner sect selection.”</span></p>

The temple returned back to normal. There was no one in the temple to hear those shocking words.</span></p>
