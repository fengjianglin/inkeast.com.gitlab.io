 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar strode forward and his sword robe rose slightly. His eyes were filled with brutality and bloodthirst and he had the wooden sword in his hand. Zhao Jiuge was bare-handed and a layer of golden light surrounded his body. He had a determined look in his eyes, and he rushed toward the youth with the scar as if he had gone crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force released by the two of them caused the surrounding air to become distorted. After a moment, they were about to collide head-to-head. The youth with the scar moved the wooden sword. It looked slow, but left afterimages because it was so fast. Zhao Jiuge’s eyes narrowed and he didn’t move. He leaned forward and then leaped forward with a fierce posture. His body moved very fast, and at this moment, the golden light around Zhao Jiuge’s body was unusually dazzling. He was like the rising sun that was going to extinguish the cold moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several rays of sword light landed on Zhao Jiuge’s body. They made some crisp sounds but left no marks. The golden light around Zhao Jiuge’s body was like a candle in the wind. It dimmed a bit, but it soon became dazzling once more. Resisting the sword lights from the youth with the scar caused his spirit force to be used up even faster. Since his Sanskrit Divine Body had reached such a degree, even his physical body held extraordinary power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t even blink, he only continued to rush forward. After resisting the sword lights, he raised his right hand and violently smashed down on the youth with the scar’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar’s expression changed for the first time. He heard the sound of wind breaking, and if that slap landed, it would be fatal. He quickly raised the wooden sword in his hand to block it. At the moment of danger, he blocked Zhao Jiuge’s violent slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wooden sword was split in half, causing everyone outside the platform to suck in breaths of cold air. They were all stunned by Zhao Jiuge’s feat. He had broken a wooden sword infused with spirit force with his bare hands. What kind of spell was this to have such extraordinary power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the older disciples in the sky became interested. They were not like the new disciples—their gazes were much more keen and knowledgeable. Nothing shown before was worth anything, only that strike from Zhao Jiuge just now had aroused their interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Zhao Jiuge break the youth with the scar’s wooden sword in half, Bai Qingqing's nervous expression relaxed a little. She looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile, and even she had to admit that Zhao Jiuge looked very handsome right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar had his sword broken, and it was his turn to lose his center of gravity. He staggered back a few steps, which looked rather embarrassing. The youth with the scar was angry. He had never considered Zhao Jiuge a worthwhile opponent, but Zhao Jiuge had just made him suffer a loss. How could he not be angry?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An uproar echoed across the crowd outside. Everyone felt that today’s battle was worth it. At first, Zhao Jiuge was being suppressed by the youth with the scar, but then, in the blink of an eye, the youth with the scar was suppressed by Zhao Jiuge. The sudden reversal of the situation made everyone feel like it was worth the trip here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but let out a cold snort after he saw that his palm had only broken the wooden sword and hadn’t injured the youth with the scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s relentless attack caused the veins on the head of the youth with the scar to pop. He rolled back on the ground to avoid Zhao Jiuge’s palm and tumbled a few times. He looked even worse now. His coiled up hair was scattered and a few strands were stuck to his cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how he was being forced to retreat like a homeless dog, the youth with the scar erupted. His eyes were filled with killing intent and even turned red from the powerful anger in his heart “Zhao Jiuge, I’m going to kill you today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An angry roar echoed across the vast Mysterious Heaven Peak. The scattered hair and madness made people feel a chill in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the scar got up and let out a roar at the sky, releasing a terrifying aura. The Mysterious Heaven Mountain Range had more spiritual energy than other places. The spiritual energy in the surroundings rushed toward the youth with the scar, and it was faintly visible to the naked eye. The spiritual energy gathered around him, creating invisible ripples. The youth with the scar closed his eyes and his hands trembled. The spirit force in his body was being consumed rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the spiritual energy gathered and took the form of a Great Earth Ash Bear. Its body was brown and it was four to five meters tall, with powerful limbs and a big head. However, its eyes were exactly like those of the youth with the scar—a fierce gaze. When the light took the form of the Great Earth Ash Bear, the stone platform below the youth with the scar’s feet crackled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t think you’re the only one with a spell. I want to see how sturdy your body refining spell is. Let me break your tortoise shell.” Under the light, the youth with the scar recovered a little and became sober. Soon, a sneer appeared on his face once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his words finished, another explosion echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another powerful aura gathered and ripple echoed around Zhao Jiuge’s body like water. This was the reaction to the threatening aura coming from the youth with the scar. Zhao Jiuge’s Sanskrit Divine Body activated on its own and the laughing buddha appeared. It was calm and peaceful—it didn’t have the hostility the youth with the scar did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the laughing buddha appeared, the world became quiet and petals swirled around its body, with the faint sound of Sanskrit being chanted. This time, it was even more clear than before, and even the fragrance of sandalwood was stronger. Listening to the Sanskrit chant in his ears, Zhao Jiuge was lost for a moment. He was shocked and wondered what the origin of the Sanskrit Heart Sutra was. It was so mysterious and extraordinary. Presumably, this was just the tip of the iceberg. As he made breakthroughs in his cultivation, the Sanskrit Divine Body would reveal more of its abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that figure filled with hostility faced the peaceful aura coming from Zhao Jiuge’s body, it felt like the hostile aura was diluted by the peaceful aura. Right now, an uproar spread in the crowd outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The older disciples finally began to privately talk with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, what kind of spell is that handsome youth using? This is the first time I've seen something like that, so peculiar.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, last time I went out with my master, even the powerful seniors I saw didn’t have such an extraordinary spell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are old, this generation of disciples is really amazing. We didn’t even come into contact with spells until we entered the inner sect. For three years, we only practiced arts. How can we compare with these disciples who use spells as if they're free?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It took me four years of earning sect contributions to buy my first spell. Constantly comparing oneself to others will only make one angry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples riding on the strange beasts or standing on the flying swords all sighed. They were all recalling back to when they had just joined the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the outstanding figure raised her beautiful brows as she looked at the shadow of the laughing buddha as if she was thinking of something. It was the glamorous woman wearing the white dress and standing on a fiery-red flying sword. She was about 25 to 26 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a circle of space around her, and no one dared to approach her. It was unknown if it was due to respect or fear that none of the older disciples stood beside her. She seemed to be used to this. She was calmly looking at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The new disciples on the ground below were all screaming. At this moment, everyone only felt envy and respect. It didn’t matter if they won or lost, because those two people had already earned everyone’s respect. After all, strength was to be respected, and nothing was more important than strength. Of course, there were two people who were exceptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun still had a calm expression—no one knew what he was thinking. The more power the two of them displayed, the more calm his expression became. Mu Zijun’s calmness had reached a terrifying level. The other person was naturally Bai Zimo. When Zhao Jiuge revealed that laughing Buddha again, his expression became even more gloomy. He had an unconvinced expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Comparing their backgrounds, Zhao Jiuge was inferior to him. Comparing cultivation levels, Zhao Jiuge was inferior to him. Yet he had lost to Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing when they were gathering herbs. How could the proud Bai Zimo accept this? This made him feel worse than being killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at Zhao Jiuge’s back and his hatred grew. He let out a snort in his heart and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There's a lot of time to find a chance to deal with you in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky beside the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three instructors became excited. They looked at each other for a while, but no one spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long time, Instructor Zhou’s face sank slightly. “Seven Layer Transformation Technique. It seems we really miscalculated this time. I didn’t expect there to be so many descendents from big families here. This can’t be a coincidence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Instructor Li heard this, he didn’t agree. He smiled faintly and stroked his long, white beard. “I don’t think you need to worry too much. No matter what, these people are all disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Heaven Peak. What are you afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou frowned. “The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect is in a precarious position, so of course we have to be cautious, especially when it comes to accepting disciples. However, I believe the head teacher has his plans. There is still plenty of time, and when they enter the inner sect in three years, the head teacher will naturally take care of it. I believe nothing will happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Wang didn’t participate in their discussion, but his eyes lit up as if he had thought of something. After a while, he changed the topic. “The Seven Layer Transformation Technique is extremely domineering. It infuses the essence blood of a spirit beast to be cultivated, and each breakthrough in level increases your power greatly. It is said that once you reach the seventh layer, the phantom you can materialize is almost corporeal and is not inferior to the spirit beast itself. This means that the stronger the spirit beast, the more powerful his technique is. However, the essence blood of a spirit beast is difficult to find, and the stronger the spirit beast, the more difficult it is to cultivate. If you’re not careful, there is the danger of your body exploding. I think this little fellow has just reached the first layer, which is the first transformation, and it’s not very stable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the other two instructors heard Instructor Wang’s words, they all nodded in agreement.</span></p>
