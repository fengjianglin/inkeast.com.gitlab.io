 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhang Long watched all of this unfold, he felt a sense of helplessness in his heart. Before, he could rely on the Eight Desolate Sword Diagram to suppress Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. But who knew the situation would reverse so quickly? And he had no way to change it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could only watch the brothers that had followed him for many years scream in pain from the sword energy. This sense of powerlessness made Zhang Long feel pain, and he remembered his first encounter with Han Songcheng. They had tried to rob Han Songcheng but were in turn defeated by this mysterious method. He was shocked and felt a deep sense of powerlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long’s face was dumbfounded while he looked at the situation. It was naturally a one-sided battle. Rays of sword energy flew out from Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s flying swords. They no longer cared about the consumption of spirit force, they only wanted to kill their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharp sword energy flew toward Fat Dragon and the others. The grass on the ground was silently cut by the sword energy flying by. The wind it created caused the grass to gently sway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were constant sounds of clothes and flesh being torn apart. Zhao Jiuge felt numb hearing these sounds. The ground was covered in blood and Zhao Jiuge felt like the screams were getting softer and softer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long saw Cheng Jianqian fail to dodge a ray of sword energy. Cheng Jianqian’s eyes widened while the ray of sword energy grew larger and larger before his eyes. It was aimed directly at his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, time seemed to stop. This was the only scene left in Zhang Long’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Jian…” A heart-wrenching scream came from Zhang Long. He watched Cheng Jianqian, who had followed him from birth throughout all these years, fall into a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Cheng Jianqian’s body fell to the ground, the blood on the ground splattered. It was a soft sound, but it was like thunder in Zhang Long’s ears. At this moment, he felt like a giant pair of hands were squeezing his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhang Long didn’t have time to grieve when two other Blood Movement Realm subordinates’ auras weakened and their bodies fell to the ground. From the looks of it, their situation was not good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhang Long was immediately awakened. His numb heart felt a chill that ran through his entire body. He suddenly thought of something terrifying and his eyes widened. He then screamed at the top of his lungs, “Luo Xuqing, are you still not going to act? All of my brothers are going to die if you don’t act quickly!” At the end, Zhang Long’s eyes were bloodshot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the two sides didn’t like each other. His side had joined Han Songcheng first and had always been favored, and Han Songcheng indeed treated them better. Whenever they obtained treasures, they would get first pick. Luo Xuqing’s side consisted of the rogue cultivators from around here. They looked down upon Luo Xuqing’s group because of their identities. They had joined Han Songcheng later, so naturally they formed a group. Luo Xuqing had the highest cultivation level, late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm like Zhang Long. They pushed Luo Xuqing as their leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long had assumed that even though they had their differences in private, they were still all people working under Han Songcheng. He had thought that at this moment of crisis, Luo Xuqing would not watch them die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his plan fell through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were four to five figures standing at the gate of the courtyard at the mountain peak. They all had their arms crossed and were smiling while watching Zhang Long’s group suffering. However, when Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing began crushing Zhang Long’s group, everyone's expression tightened up. After all, the strength of those two was simply too terrifying. In combat, they would not fare better than Zhang Long’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Zhang Long’s heart-wrenching scream echo through the peak, everyone glanced at each other. At this moment, a man in dark clothes beside Luo Xuqing walked up with a serious expression. His tone was filled with hesitation as he whispered, “Brother Luo, should we help them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xuqing didn’t immediately speak, and thoughts rapidly flashed through his mind. After weighing the pros and cons, he said, “Ignore them.” His voice was emotionless and there was a cruel smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” Just as the man in dark clothes revealed a look of hesitation and was about to say something, Luo Xuqing interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know what you want to say. Are you worried that once most of Zhang Long’s people die or are injured, the two of them will deal with us and we will suffer the same fate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man in dark clothes felt embarrassed. This was exactly what he was worried about, so he chuckled in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xuqing first secretly looked around to make sure there was no one watching and then lowered his head. Then he secretly said to the people around him, “Don’t worry, the Mountain Lord told us to guard the gate, so he won’t leave us hanging. The Mountain Lord should finish recovering soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Luo Xuqing spoke, they relaxed. After all, if something happened, there was naturally someone taller to hold things up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking this opportunity to get rid of Zhang Long’s people was for the best. In the future, they would get more of the cut when they stole things. In the face of interest, who wouldn’t be tempted? Also, it would be safer for them to encounter those two abnormal killers filled with killing intent after they wasted their energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, only Zhang Long, Fat Dragon, and another Spirit Transformation Realm brother could stand. Even though they could stand, they were ready to fall at any moment. Out of the three, Fat Dragon was the most seriously injured. The bones on this shoulder were exposed and his clothes had many cuts that were still bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After using all his might to resist a ray of sword energy, he felt like he was about to run out of spirit force. Using this opportunity to catch his breath, Zhang Long looked 100 meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, Zhang Long’s eyes almost exploded and were filled with blood. He saw Luo Xuqing’s group standing there, doing nothing. He knew that it was over for him and his brothers today. It was good to have company on the road to death. However, what infuriated him was that he hadn’t expected Luo Xuqing’s group to really leave them to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Luo Xuqing, damn you to hell!” After Zhang Long shouted this, he raised his short sword and rushed to Fat Dragon’s side. He blocked a blow that would have killed Fat Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon weakly looked at Zhang Long. He didn’t feel lucky to have escaped death, but felt glad that even at the last moment, he could be fighting side by side with his brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon’s profound glance was the last thing he saw in this world. The next moment, a powerful wave of chilly spirit force rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahahah…” Zhang Long roared like crazy after seeing this. He knew that after this attack, his only brother left would no longer exist. He was already a dried-up lamp himself and would find it difficult to save his own skin. How could he still help Fat Dragon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force surged out like a large wave, he didn’t remain idle. He quickly stepped forward with the Blue Plum Sword in hand behind the wave of spirit force toward Zhang Long. As for the other early stage Spirit Transformation Realm cultivator, he had already been dealt with by Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wave of golden spirit force contained a bitter chill and quickly arrived before Zhang Long.</span></p>

Then all the spirit force in his body erupted to protect him. He waved the short sword in his hand, sending out a slash of spirit force in hopes of combating the incoming wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all of this was in vain. The slash of spirit force was like a lone boat that was immediately drowned by the waves. The chilly spirit force continued to rush toward Zhang Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a vicious impact, Zhang Long successfully blocked this blow, but he felt like all his bones were shattered. Blood flowed out of his mouth and nose and he was sent flying backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Fat Dragon was not this lucky. While Zhang Long was resisting this wave of spirit force, Fat Dragon was surrounded by this cold, golden spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crackle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fat Dragon’s flesh exploded in all directions. What was shocking was that there was no trace of blood. All the scattered flesh was frozen in ice and gave off a chilly, white smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the layers of flowing blood were frozen. The benefits of tempering his body had begun to reveal themselves. Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force now contained the same cold attribute as the Cold Sky Sword Spirit Vein. If Zhao Jiuge could condense his spirit force and reach the Spirit Core Realm, the power of this attribute would increase multiple folds. All of his spirit force would transform to contain this attribute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, out of the eight people, seven were dead and one was seriously injured. Zhang Long was on the ground and tried to support himself up with one hand. However, pain filled his whole body and he could only bitterly struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bright red blood, white ice, and broken limbs on the ground made Luo Xuqing’s group feel a chill. It was difficult to imagine what the result would be when they faced these two asura-like youths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They felt glad that they were merely guarding the gate and secretly prayed that their Mountain Lord would recover quickly and come out soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge, who was following the spirit force, kicked off with his right leg. Then, with two more light steps, he arrived beside Zhang Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Long was still struggling when he saw this and tried to senselessly resist. However, before he could do anything, Zhao Jiuge’s Blue Plum Sword drew an arch and sliced toward Zhang Long’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A crisp sound like a ripe watermelon exploding rang out. Zhang Long’s head exploded, but the blood had long been frozen. This scene was gory enough to make people vomit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhao Jiuge felt his scalp turn numb, and his heart panicked a bit. Zhang Long’s head had exploded, but his body was still there. Zhao Jiuge quickly extended his hands toward Zhang Long’s chest and then took something. He had grabbed a jade tube. He didn’t even look at it before putting it away. Earlier, when he asked Zhang Long what formation this was, Zhang Long touched his chest, and Zhao Jiuge had noticed this. When he checked, there was indeed something there. Zhao Jiuge secretly guessed that it was related to the formation that had trapped himself and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He got up and looked around. None of the eight people remained, just like Bai Qingqing had said. At this moment, Bai Qingqing arrived next to Zhao Jiuge. The battle had ended. In the distance, Luo Xuqing’s group looked at their enemies. They didn’t dare to come over and didn’t dare to secretly leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge took out the jade tube he had taken from Zhang Long and only saw eight simple pictures. Each picture had a person holding a flying sword in a different posture. The name recorded in the jade tube was Eight Desolate Sword Diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge frowned and handed the jade tube to Bai Qingqing. “What is this thing? It doesn’t seem like a formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was surprised and took the jade tube. She looked at the contents of the jade tube and pondered. After a long time, she revealed a look of shock and exclaimed, “This seems to be a sword formation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sword formation?” Zhao Jiuge was shocked. This was the first time he had seen Bai Qingqing shocked like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A formation made of flying swords. But this doesn’t seem to be the complete sword formation, just part of it. Also, this jade tube is a copy, not the original.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge thoughtfully nodded and then remembered something. “Then can this still be used even though it's incomplete?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can use it. Zhang Long used it like a formation and was able to display so much power. You can imagine how strong it can be. Keep it. I believe Han Songcheng knows about it. Perhaps he even has the complete sword formation in hand. When we slaughter our way to him, we’ll know the details.” Bai Qingqing revealed a cold smile. She still remembered the teasing words Han Songcheng had said to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the broken sword formation, although it was pretty good, it was of little use to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge happily put away the jade tube, and his heart was bursting with joy. A mere broken sword formation could also display the power of multiplying spirit force. It was difficult to imagine what the complete sword formation would be like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he could only wait to learn about the details of the broken sword formation. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t wait to ask Han Songcheng about the sword formation. Thinking about this, he looked up at Luo Xuqing. Luo Xuqing felt a chill because Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were already walking toward them.</span></p>
