 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the way, Zhao Jiuge asked the question he had in his heart about the door in the valley. What Mo Longjie told him was that it was an auction house owned by the Mo family. The entire Dong Yang City and people nearby all went there to sell or trade for things they needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The auction house was very important and had always been in the control of the Mo family. The Xiao family looked at the auction house with envy, so the two families had always been at odds, but they never fought for real. As for the stalls in the alley, they were merely people trying to sell some things, but there was nothing good there. All the good stuff was inside the auction house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Longjie’s mouth slowly curved upward when he heard Zhao Jiuge ask about the auction house. He then said, “Jiuge, ah, do you want to see the auction house? There will be an auction tomorrow, so how about you go there with Uncle Mo for a look?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s eyes shined brightly after listening to Mo Longjie’s words. “Okay, Uncle Mo. I wanted to go take a look yesterday, but there were people guarding the door and asking for an invitation. I was wondering why, but it makes sense now that I know there is an auction tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, when we go tomorrow, Uncle Mo will get you something as a greeting gift and as a thanks for your help.” Although Mo Longjie was smiling, there was still some worry in his eyes, and even his brow was slightly wrinkled. This time, the matter was a bit serious. Not only was the Blue Moon Grass precious, but the Xiao family’s second son had been seriously injured. The Xiao family would not let this go, and the auction was tomorrow. This time, it might be either the destruction of the Xiao family or the death of the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that there would be a greeting gift, Zhao Jiuge’s face turned slightly red from excitement and his eyes became filled with joy. He was also very grateful toward Uncle Mo in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, they arrived at the Mo mansion. Zhao Jiuge looked up at the two words “Mo Mansion.” The board was black with a red border and the words were golden. Beside the door were eight men in light armor and two men in black with spirit force fluctuations. Zhao Jiuge could feel that they were both at the Spirit Detecting Realm. The entrance was paved with grey stone with five small steps leading up to the doorway and into the yard of the Mo Mansion. There were two mighty, stone lions that were very lifelike. Looking at all of this, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but sigh about how grand it all was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they walked into the yard, a man in light black armor walked forward and respectfully said, “Family Head, you’re back. I have arranged the matter for tomorrow’s auction.” Mo Longjie listened to the words from the man in black and gently nodded. “Good. Let me introduce you to Jiuge. He will be staying here for a while.” He gave off the aura of a leader and he turned to Jiuge with a smile to introduce the man in the light armor. “This is Zheng Jie, head commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at the young man before him who was around 20 years old and whose skin was a little dark. He had very lively eyes. Zhao Jiuge, who had been going to hunt in the mountains since he was young, felt like he was looking at a ferocious beast. This young man’s spirit force fluctuations were the same as his, at the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Zhao Jiuge was observing Zheng Jie, Zheng Jie was also looking back at him. He saw a youth wearing black clothes carrying a long, blue sword with a slightly childish face and an easy-going temperament. However, he didn’t underestimate Zhao Jiuge, because he could feel that the spirit force fluctuations coming from this youth were no weaker than his own. This made his pupils shrink and he pondered the meaning of the family head bringing this youth here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides nodded at each other as a greeting. Mo Longjie ordered Mo Linger with a faint smile, “Linger, take Jiuge to his room so he can have a bath and a change of clothes. For lunch, we’ll eat in the main hall, where I’ll prepare a banquet for Jiuge.” After Mo Linger heard this, she smiled. “Okay, Father.” And then pulled Jiuge away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Zhao Jiuge and Mo Linger disappeared, Mo Longjie’s face changed from his kind smile to a more solemn expression. His eyes shined as he faced Old Mo and asked, “Old Mo, what do you think?” Old Mo still had the same kind smile as he said, “Very good. This child is not old, so his heart is not complicated. After all, the heart grows with the body. Since our Mo family has helped him, he will be sure to remember. It will be good to cultivate him so he can stand beside that child Shouyi when we die. It will ensure our Mo family will be safe for at least 100 years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I know what to do. The Blue Spirit Pill should be done refining tonight. I’ll take him to see it together.” Mo Longjie nodded after pondering. Being able to reach the Blood Movement Realm at such an age proved that his future is limitless. However, next to him, Zheng Jie’s head was lowered and his eyes were gloomy. He didn’t want Jiuge to threaten his position in the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, little did they know that Zhao Jiuge’s ambition was not here—he wholeheartedly wanted to find a teacher to learn from and chase after the footsteps of that plain-clothed woman. And how could Zhao Jiuge’s achievements be something they could achieve? His goals couldn’t be contained in the small Dong Yang City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Linger brought Zhao Jiuge to the room and ran off like a happy sparrow to somewhere unknown, leaving Zhao Jiuge there. Zhao Jiuge carefully observed the room. Although it was simple, it was refreshing. As he looked at the room, Mo Linger returned with clothes in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Jiuge, I spent all night making this for you since I knew you were coming. Try it after you take a bath and see if it fits.” Mo Linger held out the clothes in her hand and lowered her head. Her entire face was red, down to her neck. When would a girl with her background ever have to touch the needles? If not for her being at this age, and some feelings having appeared when Zhao Jiuge saved her, she would not have done all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge looked at Mo Linger, he couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed. If he thought she was just enthusiastic before, he would have to be a fool to not know her heart now, but his ambitions did not lie here, and there was still that figure in his mind. Although he wasn’t old himself, he felt like Mo Linger was too young, so all he could do was act like a block of wood and accept the clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clothes were very soft and smooth. They were made of a material unknown to him. His own clothes were very rough in comparison. Zhao Jiuge looked at the girl, feeling embarrassed, and didn’t know what to say. Finally, it was Mo Linger rushing him to take a bath before lunch that helped resolve this awkward situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a long breath. He really didn’t know how to deal with this situation. He soaked in the bath and slowly relaxed. Once he finished the matter with the Xiao family, he would leave. This place was too small for him. Generally, people at the Foundation Realm focused completely on cultivation and ignored other matters where they were constantly fighting over worldly things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing the bath, he put on the clothes Mo Linger had brought him and then he walked out of the room. Mo &nbsp;Linger was waiting outside. She looked at Zhao Jiuge wearing the clothes she had made. The clothes were made from black silk and were a good fit. He had a longsword on his back and his long hair was casually draped over his shoulder with a black cloth tying it together. His handsome face still contained a bit of tenderness due to his youth, and his easy-going eyes made Mo Linger’s eyes shine. She grabbed the corner of her dress. Because of her embarrassment, she didn’t know where to place her hands, and she felt like her heart was drunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge arrived at the hall with Mo Linger, and the table was already filled with people. Aside from Mo Longjie, Old Mo, and Zheng Jie, there was another young man wearing light armor with a similar aura to Zheng Jie. Zhao Jiuge guessed that he should be another commander like Zheng Jie. After sitting down, he also noticed the young master of the Mo family, Mo Shouyi, who he hadn’t seen this morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the banquet, Mo Shouyi learned that they were going to the auction tomorrow and threw a fit about wanting to go. Mo Longjie burst out in anger and scolded, “Look at yourself, you only know how to play. You are still only at the Spirit Detecting Realm—how can I feel calm handing the Mo family to you? Look at Jiuge, he is about the same age as you and has already reached the late stage of the Blood Movement Realm. You better stay home and cultivate earnestly. If you don’t break through, you’re not going anywhere.” After scolding Mo Shouyi, Mo Longjie still felt angry as he looked at his unfilial son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Shouyi immediately became obedient and didn’t dare to speak with a face filled with grievance. Zhao Jiuge looked at this scene and smiled. He couldn’t help but envy the warmth of this family. When he first saw Zheng Jie, Zhao Jiuge felt like he was looking at a wild beast, but now Zheng Jiu was staring at him with a gloomy expression like a snake, making Zhao Jiuge's heart feel uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, a young man in black armor said something next to Mo Longjie’s ear. Then he told Zhao Jiuge to stay and sent everyone else away. They left together with Old Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the hall, they followed a corridor into a courtyard. There were men in black armor along the way on patrol. Zhao Jiuge was wondering where they were going when the smell of medicine came from ahead. A stone door was pushed open and a spectacular scene unfolded before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a pill furnace half a person tall in the middle of the stone room, and it was carved from some unknown material with three legs holding it up. The middle of it was hollow and it had a pattern inside. The smell of the medicine was floating in the air. Zhao Jiuge had only smelled a bit and he already felt refreshed. Spiritual energy turned into pure spirit force inside his body. He was shocked that medicine could have such strong potency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a skinny old man with a head of white hair standing beside the pill furnace. He was staring at the furnace when the three people arrived, and he didn’t even seem to notice them. The walls were surrounded by cabinets filled with medical herbs that Zhao Jiuge could not name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them stood there for a while before Mo Longjie gently bent over and said, “Old Yao, are the Blue Spirit Pills ready to be opened?” Zhao Jiuge saw how respectful Mo Longjie was and wondered about the identity of this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, they are ready, but I don’t know how many I have refined.” After old Yao finished speaking, he stared at the pill furnace with excitement and expectation. Mo Longjie was also excited. He took a deep breath and used his spirit force to open the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the pill furnace was opened, a strong smell of medicine spread out and a ray of blue light shined. After the smell gradually thinned, everyone nervously looked into the pill furnace to see seven shining, blue, walnut-sized pills sitting inside the pill furnace.</span></p>
