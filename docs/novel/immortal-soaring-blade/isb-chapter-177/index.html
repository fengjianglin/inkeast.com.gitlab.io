 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Sweat dripped down from their foreheads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining youths looked at each other. Finally, one of them could not stand the humiliation. He was a skinny youth. He suddenly stepped out and roared, “What’s there to be afraid of?! We have so many people—even if they are strong, they only have three. We just won’t give them the chance to attack. This old man would rather be beaten to the ground than suffer this humiliation.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go together! Even if we are beaten, we can’t lose face for our Mysterious Fallen Peak!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the skinny youth leading the way, the remaining disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak all followed. They were filled with righteous indignation, and they no longer hesitated. Spirit force surrounded their bodies once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling everyone being aroused by his actions, the skinny youth felt smug. He was going to hit the iron while it was hot, and he quickly released his spirit force. He wanted to take the lead so that the rest of the disciples would follow. He didn’t believe that all of them would lose to just three people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about how the disciples that normally looked down on him were going to defeat three Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples under his command made him very excited. His body even trembled a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a cold snort immediately shattered his dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s face was ice-cold and she raised the Wind Flower Sword. However, this time, the light was much brighter than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, seven rays of powerful sword energy flew toward the skinny youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The skinny youth’s eyes were filled with fear. He could feel the monstrous spirit force from the sword energy. Others may not feel it, but he was at the center of these seven rays of sword energy. He felt like he was a lone boat in the violent sea, isolated and helpless. At any moment, the boat could break and he would disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t have much time to react, he could only subconsciously release his spirit force to protect his body. However, the spirit force he felt was overbearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Bai Qingqing wasn’t as gentle as before and didn't suppress her strength. This was because the skinny youth’s actions had completely angered Bai Qingqing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even have a single treasure and was immediately overwhelmed by the powerful attack. First, the spirit force around his body was instantly broken and his green robe was shredded, then two objects flew into the air. Because the youth was using his arms to resist the sword energy, his arms were cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A painful cry echoed across the forest. This caused the youths behind him to turn white and not dare to move. Although the skinny youth was still standing, both his arms were cut off! Blood spread out and slowly flowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several rays of light appeared in the sky. Disciples from the Enforcement Hall were flying overhead. They were all watching, and if Bai Qingqing continued, they would not hesitate to stop her. This training didn’t allow disciples to kill, and today there were hundreds of Enforcement Hall disciples watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Qingqing didn’t need to do more and the situation came to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of the seven rays of sword energy, three hit the skinny youth. The remaining four flew at full power toward the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few people standing in front couldn’t escape and were immediately hit. They all screamed and blood sprayed out from their bodies. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grass on the ground was stained with blood. When had these immature youths seen a scene like this? Some of them were already trembling. They lacked experience and had not seen the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll say it again, hand over the flags and scram, or else you will end like them.” Bai Qingqing’s voice was filled with killing intent. While she spoke, she stared at the few laying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the remaining dozen Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples were too scared to resist. Those that hadn't fallen to the ground quickly put the flags around their waists on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then they ran away without even looking back. These disciples that had lost their flags would naturally be taken away by the patrolling Enforcement Hall disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was a figure looking at Zhao Jiuge’s group with shifty eyes. When he saw that they weren’t looking at him, he quickly knelt down to put his flag on the ground but quickly hid the flag in his clothes. Then he mixed into the panicking people running away. Perhaps because he was nervous, his movements were a bit stiff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He ran for a few steps and then, seeing that nothing had happened, he felt relieved. Just when he thought he had escaped the disaster, a ray of light pounced toward him. He didn’t look back, but he could feel the danger closing in behind him. All the hair on his body stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next instant, the youth was hit by the spirit force. His back was a mess of flesh and blood, and his green sword robe was stained with blood. Due to the force of the blow, the disciple from the Mysterious Fallen Peak was knocked forward and slid on the ground for a few meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A visible trail appeared on the ground. Bai Qingqing didn’t hold back at all. This caused Leng Rufeng to have an even stronger impression of Bai Qingqing. This suddenly made Zhao Jiuge understand why that senior brother had told him to beat the disciples of the other two people just short of killing them. Presumably, the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak had also suffered at the hands of the disciples of the other two peaks. At first he thought it was just simple punching and kicking, but it was much more! And the injuries were not light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from the few that couldn’t move, everyone else had fled like birds. The badly injured disciples were not in life-threatening danger. Someone would naturally take them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng felt like he hadn’t had enough. This made his hands itch—he still wanted to find someone to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, pick up the flags and we’ll go to the top. These disciples were not worth bullying, they were too weak.” Bai Qingqing quickly issued a command. This brief battle was merely a warmup for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at the flags on the ground and cheerfully collected them. Then he went to the disciples on the ground and took their flags. He counted them and found a total of 19.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at these flags like he was looking at precious treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He happily rushed back to Bai Qingqing and proudly showed her the flags. He was still immersed in joy as he said, “Let’s go, perhaps we’ll meet some more disciples from the other peaks. These flags come too easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing helplessly said, “Go straight to the top, this old lady doesn’t have time to waste on these weak disciples. Even if you get a lot of flags, if you can’t guard them once you reach the top, then you just did work for others. To be the fisherman, wait for them to fight for the flags and eventually they will all come to the top anyways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he felt he hadn’t had enough, he agreed with Bai Qingqing’s words. He found it very reasonable and said, “Okay, then let us move quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them no longer cared about what happened here and rushed toward the top. They didn’t hide their Foundation Realm cultivation and directly released it. They didn’t encounter any strong opponents along the way. Even when they did encounter two Mysterious Strange Peak disciples, they chose to ignore them. The number was too small and it would be a waste of time. What was worth mentioning was that when they were half way up the mountain, they encountered two Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples who were a little flustered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were two disciples from influential families that always followed Mu Zijun. They seemed to be running away from something in panic. When they saw Zhao Jiuge’s group, they were startled then hesitated for a moment. They vigilantly looked at the three of them and quickly moved around them without saying a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt like this was very funny, but Leng Rufeng couldn’t stand it. If not for the rule, Leng Rufeng would have already dealt with the two of them. The friction between the two sides had constantly grown bigger. While nothing big had happened, small conflicts happened often in private. Leng Rufeng’s side was the one to suffer the most. After all, their limited resources limited their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the angry Leng Rufeng, Zhao Jiuge patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t worry, let’s first deal with the disciples of the other two peaks. Then it'll be time to teach those arrogant fellows a lesson. Last time, we didn’t get to finish the fight. If we don’t act soon, we might not have a chance after the inner sect selection starts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing this, Leng Rufeng looked up with a burning gaze. Originally, he just wanted to do well in the training, but after hearing this, how could he not be excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All you know how to do is get into trouble, but don’t be afraid of getting into trouble. This old lady will help you.” Bai Qingqing was disgruntled at first but then smiled. Zhao Jiuge always had an illusion that this girl that always called herself an old lady and the girl that was like the brilliant summer flower were two different people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them released their spirit force. While their spirit force was being consumed, the vortex in their dantians constantly restored their spirit force. This was the difference between the Spirit Transformation Realm and the Foundation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them had wasted too much time earlier, so they didn’t make any stops. They moved like the wind using their Foundation Realm cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After more than an hour, they arrived at the top of the mountain. Along the way, they turned a blind eye to many people. The Spirit Transformation Realm disciples were not a threat to him, they only had to pay attention to the Foundation Realm disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peak of Wu Hua Peak was not big, but it had already been developed by humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a natural platform about 100 meters wide. After being developed by the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, they made the top of the peak flat and planted ancient trees around the edges. After reaching here, one could see almost all of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the high altitude, clouds would occasionally pass by. Zhao Jiuge felt like he could pick the stars with his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he was observing the top of the mountain, his heart sank. On the other side, there were already a few figures present. It seemed like they were late because of the delays. But it didn’t matter, because the show was just beginning.</span></p>
