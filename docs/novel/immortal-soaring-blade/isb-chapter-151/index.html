 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

One of them was Han Songcheng with a treacherous smile, the other was the gloomy Vulture. When he saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing give chase, Han Songcheng’s heart was filled with excitement. He suppressed his excitement and cruelly calculated how he was going to deal with these two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was even more confused. Previoused they had kept luring them by staying at the same speed as them, and now they had stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Were they trying to lure us in?”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing sneered. From everything she had experienced since young, she was not afraid of Han Songcheng’s schemes. Since the other party wanted to set a trap, they might as well just slaughter their way though.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhao Jiuge knew what Han Songcheng was thinking. Even a fool would understand what was happening. Zhao Jiuge trembled with excitement while looking at the two people before them. There wasn’t too much in his mind right now. All he wanted to do was battle, so much so that the battle intent ached in his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng &nbsp;revealed a cruel smile and looked back at the direction Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were coming from. Then his grey flying sword shined and he flew toward the mountain peak. Now that Zhang Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were here, he believed that they would follow him to his nest at Fallen Leaf Mountain without the need to taunt them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fallen Leaf Mountain was one of the tallest mountains within dozens of kilometers of Yellow Mountain Ridge. The peak was buried deep inside the clouds and was shrouded by clouds year-round. Han Songcehng steered his grey flying sword and descended on the Fallen Leaf Mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture had some doubt in his heart and asked, “Mountain Lord, do you think the two little fellows will follow?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng smiled coldly and said, “They will. Even if they don’t, it won’t matter. We can wait until we recover, then we’ll take Zhang Long and everyone to find them. They can’t escape.” After he spoke, his eyes became ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture nodded in agreement, but his gloomy gaze was filled with worry. “I just don’t know if that place can trap them and buy us time to recover. Those two must have extraordinary backgrounds. They’re so young, but their cultivation levels are almost the same as ours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng pouted and a hint of greed appeared in his bloodthirsty eyes. “The better their background, the better. They must have many riches on them. I can’t wait to see what we harvest.” While he spoke, Han Songcheng licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture had nothing to say and only nodded in agreement. However, there was a sense of unease in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far behind them, a ray of golden and blue spirit light quickly followed. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were chasing them in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Han Songcheng occasionally look back, Zhao Jiuge felt worried. He looked at Bai Qingqing and said, “Qingqing, could there be any problems later? Seeing how that dog keeps looking at us with those eyes, he is certainly up to no good. This is, after all, their nest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing only pondered a bit before answering, “No problem. Don’t move carelessly and listen to me. There should be no problem, just be ready to earn those sect contributions.” She was filled with confidence because of everything she had experienced from young. She was qualified to be self-confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Bai Qingqing talk about sect contributions, Zhao Jiuge’s heart trembled and he threw all his worries aside, a happy smile appearing on his face. When Bai Qingqing saw Zhao Jiuge’s face, she could not keep up her stern expression. She found it funny and enraging at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng’s speed began to slow down, and he descended from the sky as well. When he was about to enter a cloud, Han Songcheng looked back at the two of them. Then, without hesitation, he descended into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge had arrived as well. They didn’t hesitate and immediately charged into the clouds. After entering the clouds, their vision was reduced greatly, so they slowed down. They could only chase based on Han Songcheng’s aura ahead. They flew side by side in fear of splitting up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they had slowed down, Han Songcheng’s aura was still there. Soon, their vision brightened and they could see the surrounding scenery once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below was a sea of green, and the ground was sloped about 30 degrees. Once they passed this sea of forest, it would be some flatground on the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling Han Songcheng’s aura moving slowly below them, Bai Qingqing landed on the ground. After the two of them landed, they looked at their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground gave off the smell of dirt, and there were layers of dead branches and leaves scattered all over the ground. This slope was covered in dense, green bamboo that grew every few meters. In addition, there was nothing else here, not even the sound of birds or insects; it was abnormally silent. Looking up, one could see the blue sky and the occasional cloud floating by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge looked at each other. They saw the shock in each other’s eyes, but Han Songcheng’s aura was at the peak. The two of them held their flying swords and were carefully on guard while they approached the peak on foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their footsteps went from slow vigilance until they were running as fast as flying. However, their surroundings remained roughly unchanged from the beginning. Aside from the bamboo forest, there was just more bamboo forest. The dense bamboo forest was like an illusion that made their scalps tingle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing felt Han Songcheng’s aura going further and further away, but their surroundings didn’t change. Aside from the bamboo, dead leaves, and dirt, there was nothing else. Even the sky remained unchanged, and the clouds had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, after the two of them had walked for half an hour, Bai Qingqing stopped with a solemn expression. When Bai Qingqing stopped, Zhao Jiuge also stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something is wrong. We haven’t walked out of this small place after half an hour. Strange!” Bai Qingqing suddenly said in shock. Her brows were furrowed and she carefully looked around while she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge also felt like this was strange. They walked for a long time but felt like they were walking in place. The scenery hadn’t changed, and Han Songcheng’s aura had long since stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Bai Qingqing’s words, Zhao Jiuge’s face became ugly. Facing this strange matter, although he panicked a little, he was still composed because Bai Qingqing was around. If he had encountered something like this himself, he would’ve begun to panic already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is strange about it?” Zhao Jiuge felt his heartbeat accelerate. He stared at his surroundings and only dared to whisper. He was afraid that if he talked too loudly, it would cause something to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing suddenly spat out two words. “Illusion formation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Illusion formation? Zhao Jiuge was shocked and then his eyes widened. He had heard about it when he entered the sect, but he didn’t learn too much about it. To think he would fall into an illusion formation now—Zhao Jiuge was caught off guard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then there was a complicated look on his face. He felt curiosity as well as fear toward this illusion formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly recalled the explanation about illusion formations. As the name implies, it's a formation that creates an illusion. Low level illusion formations required the actual surroundings, along with formation disks and flags, to be completed. Higher level ones only required a high-grade formation disk and flags to create the illusion formation. The top tier ones could instantly change the surroundings and you wouldn’t even know what was an illusion or what was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the jade he was given when he entered the sect, there was information introducing illusion formations, but Zhao Jiuge could only remember this much. Ilusion formations were only one kind of formation. When he was fleeing the city of Dong Yang, the people sent by the Xiao family had used a killing formation against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Bai Qingqing say the words “illusion formation,” Zhao Jiuge became a bit excited. It felt like a new world had opened up to him. After two years, he had finally entered this wonderful world where he came out on missions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wonderful cultivation world had begun to show itself. This was no doubt just the beginning, the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what should we do? Do we continue to keep going like this?” Zhao Jiuge softly asked, even though things were like this. But with Bai Qingqing around, Zhao Jiuge felt calm. Bai Qingqing gave Zhao Jiuge a feeling of dependency, and he felt like Bai Qingqing was leading him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, even though Bai Qingqing had an ugly expression and her brows were furrowed, she didn’t panic. “We’ll just have to break this formation, or else we will be trapped here forever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, her hand holding the Wind Flower Sword relaxed. She moved her hair back and continued, “Fortunately, this illusion formation is not that dangerous. It’s used purely to trap enemies and has no offensive capabilities.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t have the insight Bai Qingqing had and therefore could only ask, “Then you have a way of breaking it?” Seeing Bai Qingqing’s disdain for the illusion formation, Zhao Jiuge felt like the illusion formation was not that difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Bai Qingqing didn’t immediately reply and her eyes shined. Her hands were moving like she was thinking about something. When Zhao Jiuge saw her like this, he didn’t disturb her, he let Bai Qingqing finish thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After waiting for a while, Bai Qingqing finally said, “This kind of illusion formation is merely using the bamboo forest coupled with some formation disks and flags. To break it, we just need to find the center formation disk. As long as we find the disk and break it, the surrounding illusion will disappear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s face revealed disdain as she continued, “I’m surprised a Foundation Realm cultivator like Han Songcheng could set up an illusion formation around his nest. Although it's not some profound illusion formation, this is still pretty good for someone like him. However, I grew up learning about formations, so give me some time and I should be able to remove it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Bai Qingqing’s confidence, Zhao Jiuge felt glad that he had come with Bai Qingqing this time. While feeling envious about Bai Qingqing’s knowledge, he sighed and felt that he was still too inexperienced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was thinking about something, so he didn’t think too much about the last thing Bai Qingqing said. He never asked for the details about her family background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far away from the bamboo forest’s illusion formation, there were about seven or eight people pointing while talking and laughing.</span></p>
