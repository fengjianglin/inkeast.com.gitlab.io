 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, without hesitation, he released his spirit force around him. The youth with the scar and Bai Zimo released their spirit force as well. Looking at the weakened Bai Qingqing and the bloody Zhao Jiuge, it would be like beating a drowned dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the other side was going to attack, Luo Xie clenched the blood-colored sword in his hand. He was filled with a sense of excitement and softly asked Zhao Jiuge, “Jiuge, how should we deal with them?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys don’t need to worry, I can deal with them alone. I need those 200-plus flags that they hold. Otherwise, I might not have enough to obtain the precious treasure-grade flying sword. Either I don’t get any or all three are mine!” He waved his hand, signaling Luo Xie and the dozen or so youths to not intervene. From his words, he intended to deal with the five of them on his own and take all three precious treasures for himself so Mu Zijun’s group couldn’t even get one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though only three out of the five people had activated their spirit force, Zhao Jiuge could not deal with them alone! It was likely the first time these youths had faced this kind of situation, and they were trembling in excitement. However, they still listened to Zhao Jiuge’s words and didn’t act recklessly. They secretly cycled their spirit force in case something happened. After all, they still had Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the delicate body in his arms move, Zhao Jiuge softly said, “Stay still and don’t move. I can deal with it myself this time. How can I let you take care of the situation for me every time? You should rest in my arms like this.” His words were serious at first, but they became frivolous again towards the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge said this, he knew Bai Qingqing had helped him a lot. Not to mention that after using The Blue Tide Rises, she had injured her core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing no longer moved and a faint layer of red appeared on her face. In her heart she scolded,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If not for the fact that this old lady is too weak right now, I would have pulled your ears off, you brat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing still had the heart to flirt in this situation, the originally cold-faced Liu Yinger’s expression sank even more. Then her Foundation Realm cultivation erupted and she showed signs of making a move as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Love deeply, hate deeply. Although this love in her heart had not even bloomed, the sad and angry Liu Yinger just wanted to vent the dissatisfaction in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that even Liu Yinger was going to make a move, Wang Baiwan could not care about their previous friendship anymore. He became determined and activated his spirit force as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, five Foundation Realm auras appeared at the top of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, the blood-stained Zhao Jiuge was holding Bai Qingqing and was still in the mood to flirt. This surprised all the disciples watching through the Mysterious Light Mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previous duels were already very exciting and eye-opening. Now that it was an internal fight among the Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples, the stakes were no longer there. It was just a matter of how much interest they had in this internal fight and if any exciting changes would occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Tianshan waved the fan in his hand and smiled. “Hehe, I didn’t expect that boy to be so romantic.” His elegant appearance attracted the gazes of a lot of the surrounding female disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words caused Sha Sha, who was beside Wu Tianshan, to be filled with dissatisfaction. Her two pigtails shook with her head and then she shouted, “Little hooligan!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she said that, she secretly stared at Bai Qingqing’s chest and then secretly looked at herself. Seeing the difference, she pouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tense atmosphere on Wu Hua Peak continued. While Zhao Jiuge had his arms around Bai Qingqing, several provinces away from the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, a young girl was thinking about this block of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green Jade Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was now autumn, and Green Jade Mountain was far less beautiful than it was in the winter. The withered and lonely scene was not as brilliant as it was in the winter, when the mountain was covered in red plum flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a young girl was standing on this hill. Even though the surrounding trees were bare, they couldn’t hide how brilliantly she shined. The heavens and earth seemed to be overshadowed by her appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl was wearing a plum-red dress and her tender, white shoulders were exposed. However, she had a small coat made of white yarn draped over her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her silk-like hair was not scattered but coiled up high with a green jade hairpin holding it up. &nbsp;Her eyes were filled with spirit and her face had a hint of grievance while she looked into the distance. It was Su Su, who had parted with Zhao Jiuge almost three years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su looked into the distance with the mountain behind her back. Her beautiful eyes were looking into the distance while she was thinking of something. Compared to before, Su Su had lost a lot of weight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Su Su’s face was not haggard and instead filled with spirit, her yearning was like an aging wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had become more and more intense with time. It was also like a cup of old tea—at first it was bitter, but the more you drank, the more fragrant it became. The fragrance and taste were intoxicating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su silently looked into the distance and stood there motionlessly. Occasionally, the breeze would cause the edge of her skirt to flutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The naivety had faded from her beautiful face and she had grown taller. Not only had she grown taller, but her temperament had become even more refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she would not spend most of the day here in a daze like before, she still came here once a month. She was not just here to think of someone, but more for that trace of hope in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, she had finished cultivating and couldn’t help but come here because soon, she would go to a dangerous place with Grandpa Yang to attempt to condense her spirit core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She just stood there and zoned out, thinking about something. She seemed to become one with the picturesque scenery; she was like a woman in a painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, an old man wearing plain clothes and holding a longsword smiled while looking at this scene. His eyes were filled with love and he sighed. “The young lady has grown up, she even has someone she likes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Zhao Jiuge were here, he would know that this was Grandpa Yang, who had saved him from Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a young man wearing a blood-colored robe beside the old man. He was filled with jealousy from the old man’s words. His face was filled with reluctance as he muttered, “Isn’t it just that stinky brat? When he comes, I want to see just what kind of deity he is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grandpa Yang was amused by this young man’s words and smiled, but he didn’t speak. He looked back lovingly at the girl’s back. Thinking about Zhao Jiuge, although his talent was average, he had a determined heart. It was not something a proud genius of the sect could compare to. The latter had excellent talent and had a smooth path in cultivation, without suffering any setbacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the old man remain silent, the young man in the blood-colored robe could only change the topic. He respectfully asked with curiosity in his eyes, “Elder Yang, do you think the young lady will be able to successfully reach the Spirit Core Realm and trigger a phenomenon when her spirit core forms?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Yang pondered a bit and then slowly said, “Breaking through to the Spirit Core Realm is certain, but I’m not sure if a phenomenon will be triggered. The Pure Spirit Tactic the young lady cultivates is different from the cultivation methods you all use—it is a top-tier cultivation method. With the young lady’s talent, it is likely for a phenomenon to appear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to think of something and continued, “When the time comes, we’ll wait and see.” There was a hint of worry on his face. He was even more tense now than when he first formed his own spirit force. Su Su was such a lovely girl and he had watched her grow up, so how could he not worry? After all, forming one’s spirit core was the most critical part on the path of cultivation. It was even more important than forming the foundation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Foundation Realm was about setting the foundation and strengthening one's spirit force with an attribute by tempering one’s body in a spirit vein. Forming one’s spirit core was like condensing a seed that would turn into a nascent soul. Then one would need to water the seed to make it germinate, flower, and finally bear fruit to confirm one’s dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One’s cultivation method determined how far they could cultivate, and this would also depend on their talent, luck, and etc. Some trash cultivation methods would only enable one to reach the Spirit Transformation Realm, but some of the top-tier cultivation methods would allow one to walk far. The better the cultivation method, the more difficult it would be to progress, but once a cultivator formed their spirit core, there might be a phenomenon. The stronger this phenomenon was, the greater your achievements in the future would be and the greater chance of ascending to immortality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Old Man Mysterious Heaven, the one who created the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, had triggered a phenomenon when he formed his spirit core. The Law Horns blew and the Celestial Drums rang. Later on, he was able to ascend!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s why forming one’s spirit core was the most critical step. Most people would not trigger a phenomenon, but most people would hold on to this hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su looked for a long time before she let out a sigh and walked toward the two of them. At the same time, she thought to herself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Block of wood, you better show up for our five year agreement. Otherwise, don’t blame me for personally going to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect to deal with you. If it comes to that, you will be finished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Su Su approached the two of them, the young man in the blood-colored robe jealousy said, “Look at your pitiful appearance. When you ran away from home, you didn’t think of me like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Su quickly looked at him and said, “Just look at yourself, Xue Wuxing. Do you think that's possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Wuxing wasn’t angry at all and faintly smiled. “I said it before. Once he arrives, see how I’m going to deal with him. I heard that when you guys parted, he was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm. Let's see how much he will improve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Yang smiled while he watched the two juniors argue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xue Wuxing thought Su Su was going to erupt in anger, Su Su laughed instead. “You deal with him? Not necessarily. I fear that when the time comes, it will be him who deals with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, she sweetly smiled at Elder Yang and said, “Granda Yang, let us go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The kind smile on Elder Yang’s face became even stronger. In his heart, he thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, no matter how talented you are, that boy Zhao Jiuge is no pushover either.”</span></p>

He felt envy, admiration, and hatred for this young man he had never met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When leaving, Su Su turned back and reluctantly looked at the scenery like she wanted to engrave it in her mind. It was more likely she wanted to remember the face of that blockhead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She would not be back for a while since she was going to a dangerous place to make her breakthrough.
