 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Although he dreaded Zhao Jiuge’s powerful sword and cultivation, he had been through a lot himself. He had to progress one step at a time to achieve what he had today, and this wasn’t enough to make him surrender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was some darkness inside his eyes. If not for the yin object he had detected inside the village, he wouldn't have minded fighting against Zhao Jiuge to see who was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they first met and he saw how young Zhao Jiuge was and how he was wearing the robe of a sword cultivator, he already wanted to fight to see who was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, after he accidentally obtained the cultivation method, he had managed to gain some success. His path had been smooth and he had been able to deal with every situation he encountered. This made him even more confident in himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He let out a cold snort in his heart. He thought that after he dealt with the yin object tonight, he would then deal with Zhao Jiuge. He was going to let Zhao Jiuge be arrogant for now. Thinking about this, a trace of viciousness appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge walk further and further away, the little Daoist boy’s pale expression suddenly changed. His cute face had a vicious expression and he gritted his teeth. "Master, why didn’t you teach that boy a lesson? Are you going to let him bully us like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery patiently explained to his disciple, “Although it looked like what I displayed was amazing, only I know that this matter is rather difficult. I don’t want to fight this boy now and injure us both only to help the yin object. After this matter is finished, Teacher will get revenge for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Daoist boy nodded and buried this matter in his heart. He would wait for his master to deal with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the master and disciple finished talking, they followed Zhao Jiuge into the village. There were still matters they needed to learn about in the village. Tonight was destined to be a sleepless night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing both Zhao Jiuge and the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery entering the village, Yu Qingshan shouted. He and the rest of his family all headed toward the ancestral home that they had been afraid to enter for several months. Perhaps because he had seen the power that both Zhao Jiuge and the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery displayed, he felt more calm. Perhaps it was only psychological, but he felt like the sun was a bit brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what words between the master and disciple, the Yu family turned a blind eye. Yu Qingshan was cunning and knew that mortals like them couldn’t interfere in fights between immortals. The most important thing now was to deal with the matter at hand. As for the other stuff, it was beyond his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Yu Qiusheng was filled with excitement and constantly told his sister, Yu Xiasheng, about how cool Zhao Jiuge was. In particular, he talked about how he had been oppressed by the aura and felt breathless. His constant chatter made the previously excited Yu Xiasheng very calm. She speechlessly watched this younger brother of hers perform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after seeing the master and disciple pair whisper with such vicious expressions, Yu Xiasheng didn’t even have to think to know that they were planning to deal with Zhao Jiuge. Her eyes were filled with worry and she decided to remind Zhao Jiuge to be more careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After witnessing the fight between the two of them, everyone’s fear lessened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhao Jiuge walked through the village, his heart felt much lighter after his eruption earlier. He felt more relaxed, and the yin energy didn’t feel as gloomy compared to before, but this just made Zhao Jiuge even more alert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He casually walked through the village and observed the situation of every family. It was very quiet the whole way, and the entire village had a depressing atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no children in the village, there were mostly elders and occasionally a few middle-aged people. This made Zhao Jiuge’s brows furrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stopped in the middle of the road and began to ponder. The village was not small and he didn’t know the direction to the Yu family's ancestral home, so he decided to wait for everyone to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, footsteps echoed behind him. When they saw Zhao Jiuge standing there, everyone quickly walked up to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are we not going? Did the Elder Immortal find something?” Yu Qingshan was somewhat puzzled as he looked at Zhao Jiuge. Coming here again made him feel fear, but he had already seen how extraordinary these two were, so he suppressed the fear in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing aside from the yin energy being dense. I haven’t found anything. I just feel very strange, but I don’t know why yet.” Zhao Jiuge gently shook his head and looked puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It's the sound! Did you not notice that the entire village is so quiet that we don’t even hear the sounds of any animals? This is abnormal, it must be the work of some demon.” After hearing Zhao Jiuge’s doubts, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery immediately pointed out the problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s expression was very gloomy, while Zhao Jiuge was like a newborn calf who wasn’t afraid of a tiger. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was older and more experienced, so he understood how dangerous the situation was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the village, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery put aside their differences. If the situation tonight wasn’t good, the two might have to join forces. After all, they had a common enemy to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s explanation, Zhao Jiuge nodded. Since the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had given him a chance to take a step back, he would naturally not refuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the seriousness of the situation, Yu Qinshan was able to remain stable because he was the head of the family. However, the rest of the Yu family’s expressions became cloudy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery immediately said, “It’s still broad daylight, what's there to be afraid of? Once night arrives, just stay inside the house.” He was somewhat impatient and let the rest of the Yu family lead the way to the Yu family’s ancestral home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They walked through the village, and soon, a large house different from the rest of the village appeared before everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other houses in the village were mostly brick houses or wooden huts, but the Yu family's ancestral home was no worse than their home in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was made of greenish-grey stones, wooden support beams, and black tilts. Just looking from the front gate, one could see how large this house was. It had three different entrances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a plaque made of brown wood hanging above the gate of the ancestral home with the words “Yu Ancestral Home” written on it in red. It looked old from the passage of time and seemed to have witnessed all the glory of the Yu family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just this old house showed what kind of status the Yu family had here, but now such a strange thing was occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qingshan was, after all, the head of the family, so everyone stood outside the gate, looking at him. They were waiting for him to speak.</span></p>

It was as if he wanted to say something but then swallowed those words. He then looked profoundly at the gate of the old house, and there was fear in his eyes.</span></p>

I still need to understand what happened. You don’t have anything to be afraid of. Even if I can’t solve this issue, I can at least ensure your family’s safety and escape. Not to mention we still have this young hero here.” When he spoke of Zhao Jiuge, there was an inexplicable smile on his face.</span></p>

Otherwise, the old fox would have dropped all pretenses. Zhao Jiuge knew the seriousness of the situation and was too lazy to rip open that facade, so he decided to let the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery take the lead for now.</span></p>

We will go inside and tell you what happened. At least then we will be prepared for the night.” After hearing Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s words, Yu Qingshan’s expression relaxed a bit and some color returned to his face.</span></p>

After all, this is still our Yu family’s ancestral home.” After he finished speaking, he stepped forward a few steps and began to shout.</span></p>

Then if you read the start of the next chapter it's really obvious there is something missing here. However, I have not managed to find it as the official site has the duplicated part here and all other sites have the same thing. As far as I can tell from the next chapter the missing part is about a servant named Uncle Liu likely explaining the current situation of the house. Nothing very important seems to be missing. If I manage to track down this missing part, I’ll update it.</span></p>
