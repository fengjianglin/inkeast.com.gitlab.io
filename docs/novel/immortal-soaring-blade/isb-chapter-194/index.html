 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

There was rarely a chance to leave the sect aside from doing missions. Even then, they would still only be within the area controlled by the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He enjoyed the picturesque scenery around him and felt more relaxed. After their playful pursuit, they were now flying next to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The breeze caused their hair to flutter and a trail of light followed their flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly asked Bai Qingqing, filled with curiosity, “Qingqing, do you think a phenomenon can really appear when someone reaches the Spirit Core Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation level had increased, he was about to face the task of forming his spirit core. He had read some information about forming one’s spirit core, and this made Zhao Jiuge curious. He wondered what forming one’s spirit core was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Some do; however, very few people can trigger a phenomenon. Besides, just triggering a pheromone doesn’t mean that their path will be smooth in the future. Many geniuses that trigger a phenomenon still fall in the end,” Bai Qingqing answered affirmatively like she knew a lot about forming one’s spirit core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s worried look, Bai Qingqing comforted him, “This is not something you should worry about, as you can no longer change your cultivation method. Everything is already set, so even if you don’t trigger a phenomenon, you shouldn't be discouraged. After all, everything must be obtained by your own power. As long as you don’t give up, it's fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmmm.” Zhao Jiuge nodded heavily. Since he could not understand it, then he simply wouldn’t think about it. He should deal with the matter at hand first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Profound Thunder Canyon was located northeast of the sect. The two of them did not fly at full speed but instead at a leisurely pace. This was because they had to maintain a certain amount of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how absentminded Zhao Jiuge was, Bai Qingqing still felt a bit worried and reassured him, “When you’re about to make a breakthrough to the Spirit Core Realm, there will naturally be an elder from the sect who will guide you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge heard this, he felt some doubt in his mind and suddenly asked, “You have been at the late stage of the Foundation Realm for so long, shouldn’t you be condensing your Spirit Core soon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing suddenly sneered and revealed a mocking smile. “If I wanted to condense my spirit core, I could have done it at any time. I simply have not finished preparing yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she wanted to condense her spirit core, she could have done it a long time ago, but she didn’t want to condense her spirit core here. After all, this was no small matter, and she could not stay at the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect forever. If not for the situation at home, she would have never come to the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Now that the situation should have been resolved, it was about time for her to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were silently thinking about their own matters, so only the hums from their flying swords could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would only take them five days if they move at full speed, but due the problem with using all their spirit force outside, they took nine days to reach the edge of the Profound Thunder Canyon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, aside from resting to recover during the night, they didn’t waste time watching the scenery. They headed straight for the Profound Thunder Canyon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were somewhat haggard as they flew through the sky on their flying swords. As they looked down at the canyon below, it was not small but also not too big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A large ravine lay before them. Both sides were rocky land with a river cutting it in half. Both sides were flat, and the center was where the canyon was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many strange rocks covered in exotic flowers and dense jungle on both sides of the canyon. This gave the desolate canyon a breath of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blue sky, white clouds, flowing river, strange rocks, yellow sand, and green jungle formed this scenic canyon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, they could only see the surface of the canyon. As for what was inside, they would have to head inside to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After observing the canyon, the two of them put away their flying swords and entered. They followed the slow-flowing river. It was not large and the flow of water was not very fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blue Thunder Rage Lion was not the only spirit beast in this canyon; there were many other spirit beasts. However, due to its location, there weren’t many powerful spirit beasts here. At most, they were only at the late stage of the Foundation Realm like the lion. Otherwise, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect wouldn’t allow their disciples to come here to carry out the mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sudden roar came from the distance, sounding hysterical. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing felt the earth tremble, and the roar was very harsh to the ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rocks fell from the side of the canyon and the trees all trembled, making the leaves shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were both shocked. They looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be the Blue Thunder Rage Lion?” Zhao Jiuge was a bit surprised. They had just entered the canyon and already found traces of the Blue Thunder Rage Lion. What kind of coincidence was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the commotion, it seemed like the Blue Thunder Rage Lion was not far away from them. However, just that roar had shocked their hearts, and the commotion it created showed how powerful it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s beautiful eyes changed slightly. She didn’t expect a late stage Foundation Realm Blue Thunder Rage Lion to be so strong. Originally, she thought it would be an easy mission, but it seemed like this mission would have a certain amount of difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing nodded and whispered, “Yes, it looks like the Blue Thunder Rage Lion. The record said that there wasn’t any other powerful spirit beast here and that the Blue Thunder Rage Lion seems to have gone crazy lately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is no love for no reason and no hate for no reason. What do you think is the reason that the Blue Thunder Rage Lion has become crazy like this?” Zhao Jiuge had regained his composure from the original shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing rolled her eyes. “You ask me, but how should I know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge looked at Bai Qingqing and asked, “Then, what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering a bit, Bai Qingqing whispered, “Hide your aura, we’ll go check out the situation. From that roar just now, it should not be far away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them carefully walked forward with their guard up. This was not comfortable like the sect, danger was everywhere. Life or death was decided in an instant, and if they were not careful, they might lose their lives.</span></p>

This was not the first time he had seen a spirit beast, but the Blue Thunder Rage Lion still shocked him greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was close to three meters tall and its large body gave off a ferocious feeling. Then Zhao Jiuge began to carefully observe its appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its torso was blue, with specks of spirit light. Its limbs were snow-white and only its torso was blue. The blue fur looked like a piece of armor.</span></p>

Each claw gave off a cold light, and just looking at it would make you feel a chill in your heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its head was ferocious and its eyes were scarlet. It looked similar to a normal lion, but there was a silver horn about ⅔ of a meter long on its head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Blue Thunder Rage Lion seemed to have gone crazy. Spirit force surged out from its body and a powerful pressure spread out. It was partially lying on the ground, and a low growl came from its mouth.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It looks like this Blue Thunder Rage Lion really seems to be a bit odd. It's going crazy on its own, kind of like a certain someone else going crazy.” Zhao Jiuge lowered his head next to Bai Qingqing, and there was a smile on the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you say?” Bai Qingqing stared at Zhao Jiuge with a threatening expression. It seemed like she was going to punish Zhao Jiuge at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge chuckled and dodged to the side, away from Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them were whispering to each other, the Blue Thunder Rage Lion that was going crazy suddenly stopped. It turned its head and its scarlet eyes looked toward the direction of the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Accompanying a deafening roar, a late stage Foundation Realm pressure surged toward the two of them. It looked like the Blue Thunder Rage Lion had noticed the two of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s smile disappeared and his expression changed greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two auras suddenly spread out, and both of auras also had the power of the late stage of the Foundation Realm. It was Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing releasing their spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that they had been found by the Blue Thunder Rage Lion, Zhao Jiuge subconsciously held the Big-Dipper Sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Big-Dipper Sword shined brightly and continued to buzz. Zhao Jiuge’s aura continued to rise, and soon it was not much weaker than the Blue Thunder Rage Lion’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Bai Qingqing surged her spirit force, she didn’t take out her Wind Flower Sword. Instead, she looked at the crazy Blue Thunder Rage Lion coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After reaching the Foundation Realm, the Blue Thunder Rage Lion had gained a certain amount of intelligence. It didn’t expect these two small humans to be able to release auras no weaker than its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its ferocious expression revealed that it was pondering. Its roars from before disappeared and turned into a low growl. It seemed to be hesitating and thinking of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should we do? Do we run or just do it?” Zhao Jiuge was completely focused on the Blue Thunder Rage Lion. He had been mobilizing the spirit force in his body in case of a sudden attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch your words!” Bai Qingqing helplessly reprimanded him. However, the situation didn’t give them much time to think. She playfully yelled, “Let’s do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the two of them were going to make a move, the Blue Thunder Rage Lion seemed to be enraged by their dismissive attitude.
