 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He inhaled the fresh air of the mountain and felt very happy. The sunlight shining on the mountain made this place look otherworldly. This mountain was separated from the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cold air floating around him made him feel like he was among clouds. The strange plants all had drops of dew. He looked at the mountains connected together with no end in sight. Zhao Jiuge wondered when he would have his own place here. He heard Luo Xie’s footsteps behind him and withdrew from his thoughts. The two of them headed toward the square. That was where the new disciples would have their first class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived, they saw people in small groups spread across the square, all whispering about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Baiwan and Liu Yinger saw Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie, their eyes lit up and they quickly went to greet them with smiles. There was another who noticed Zhao Jiuge’s arrival—it was the alluring girl who had charmed Zhao Jiuge on the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she got close, a light fragrance arrived, and when Zhao Jiuge smelled this, he turned toward its source. What he saw made the corner of his eye twitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Either because she started cultivating or because she thought her previous clothes were too eye-catching, she had changed out of her alluring outfit. Now she was now wearing a long, red dress. There was a thin layer of silk around her shoulders, and her long, black hair was scattered across her back. Her beautiful eyes were looking at Zhao Jiuge with a smile that wasn’t a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl got close and saw Zhao Jiuge’s appearance. She couldn’t help letting out a pleasant laugh as she covered her mouth with her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if she couldn’t bear seeing Zhao Jiuge being embarrassed in front of so many people, the alluring girl smiled and called out with a smile, “Can you come over here so we can talk alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge subconsciously shook his head. He was already aware of how powerful she was. He felt a sense of danger from her. The more beautiful a woman was, the more cunning she was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl’s right eyebrow rose slightly and she stared at Zhao Jiuge without blinking. Very few people, especially men, could refuse her. She didn’t expect him to be a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A big man like you is afraid of a woman like me eating you? What’s wrong with having a word in private?” The more Zhao Jiuge acted like this, the more curious she became. However, there was no smile on her face this time, and her voice was a bit cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is nothing to talk about between us.” Unsurprisingly, Zhao Jiuge was still wary and stil politely refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge refuse again, Luo Xie became too anxious and could not hold himself back. “If he doesn’t want to go, I’ll accompany you for a chat. We can talk for however long you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he tried to force his lecherous face to reveal what he thought was a handsome expression. He thought that Zhao Jiuge was a block of wood to refuse a beautiful woman’s invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl opened her mouth to speak, but she suddenly stopped. Her delicate face that was facing Zhao Jiuge turned toward Luo Xie. Seeing the beautiful woman look at him, Luo Xie felt his breathing become rough and he suddenly didn’t know what to do. This was the first time such a seductive woman was carefully observing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl’s right hand gently moved aside a few strands of her hair that was scattered across her forehead and put them behind her ear. A smile suddenly appeared on the corner of her mouth. “Are you sure you want to come and chat with me alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice dragged. When she talked about “chatting alone,” her tone was especially heavy. Luo Xie shivered. Although the alluring girl had a smiling face, her dark eyes were extremely cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Xie was just lecherous on the surface—he didn’t have the courage to actually go through with it. After seeing how the alluring girl’s gaze was like knives, he didn’t dare to utter one more word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl gently tapped her hand as if she was very satisfied with Luo Xie’s reaction before turning toward Zhao Jiuge. Zhao Jiuge felt bitterness in his heart as he looked at this girl revealing a fox-like smile. He was very on guard against her. He couldn’t afford to offend her, and now he couldn’t even hide from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Brother, when you were on the stairs, Big Sister taught you that man can’t say no. How can you forget so quickly?” At this moment, everyone else looked over. After all, a beautiful woman would attract attention anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more people gathered around. Feeling all the gazes on him, no matter how thick his skin was, he couldn’t stand it. He pursed his lips and was filled with helplessness. After a while, he finally said, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The alluring girl revealed a happy smile as the two of them walked to the side. Zhao Jiuge’s steps were slow, as if to express his unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two left, a cold and jealous gaze locked onto Zhao Jiuge’s back. It was a youth wearing a magnificent set of embroidered clothes who gave off an extraordinary aura. There was a long scar on his handsome face, going from the corner of his eye to his forehead. The aura he gave off was that of a ferocious beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was one of the few people that had erupted back on the stairs. He was from a prominent family and had been sent to live in the Southern Barbarian Forest to cultivate at an early age. He had returned recently to enter a holy land. When he first saw the alluring girl that day, he had fallen in love at first sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t for the alluring girl and Zhao Jiuge having a good time talking while walking up the stairs, he wouldn't have been taken over by his anger and released his aura early, causing the rest to erupt as well. When he saw how the alluring girl treated Zhao Jiuge differently, his heart was filled with jealousy. He secretly looked at Zhao Jiuge with hatred in his heart and remembered him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwang coldly looked at the two as they left. After they were gone, he said, “That girl is not an easy person to deal with.” Although he looked carefree, he was very observant. He just didn’t say it in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t known if it was because they were both women or because she didn’t like this alluring girl, but Liu Yinger nodded in agreement. However, she didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the side of the square.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two people faced each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell do you want to talk to me about?” Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were alert and his tone was unpleasant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to be friends with you. My name is Bai Qingqing.” Her words were a bit far stretched, and although her speech was relaxed, there was a flash of light in her eyes. Although the movement was slight, Zhao Jiuge still noticed, and this made him even more vigilant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should already know my name. Since this is all you want to talk about, I’ll take my leave.” After he finished speaking, he turned to leave. Bai Qingqing was too difficult to deal with, and Zhao Jiuge didn’t want to deal with her at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing moved very fast and suddenly pulled Zhao Jiuge’s arm as he turned. She seemed to be in a rush and said, “Don’t leave yet, I still have something to say.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking back at Bai Qingqing, Zhao Jiuge had doubt in his eyes. He waited for her to speak to see what else she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s just that… I want to know what spell you used back then on the stairs. I’m very curious. By the way, don’t get me wrong, I have no other intention. Just tell me the name, I feel like it's a little special.” Bai Qingqing no longer had the joking expression. Her face was a little red, as if she was embarrassed about asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Magical treasures and spells were each individual’s privacy, and it was a big taboo to ask others about them. However, Bai Qingqing was really just curious. She came from the Eastern Sea and was curious about everything in the mainland. After she got permission from her family to join the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, she saw Zhao Jiuge’s extraordinary spell and simply became very curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sanskrit Divine Body.” After leaving behind these three cold words, Zhao Jiuge turned to leave without any hesitation. Zhao Jiuge was very vigilant against people who asked him about his cultivation method and spells, but looking at Bai Qingqing’s appearance, he still told her the name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s departing back, Bai Qingqing muttered, “Sanskrit Divine Body.” Then she thought about how Zhao Jiuge acted and couldn’t help but become angry from embarrassment. She had always been held up high back home, but she had just gotten here and had to suffer this kind of treatment. She let out a snort and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teaching Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instructor Zhou was standing in front and there were 10 rows neatly laid out. Each row had three small, wooden tables, and there was a grass mat laid out behind each table. At this moment, there were already many people sitting on the grass mats. There were paintings hanging around the walls of the teaching hall as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge had a serious face as he carefully listened to Instructor Zhou’s every word. He feared that if he became distracted, he would hear something wrong and thus miss something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After everyone from the square arrived, the 80 to 90 people were divided into three different teaching halls. After they were split, Zhao Jiuge found that aside from Luo Xie, he knew no one else here, and almost all of them were disciples without good family backgrounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t think too much and focused wholeheartedly on listening to Instructor Zhou’s lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe you all know that my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect cultivates the sword and that all our spells and cultivation methods are inseparable from the sword. The main inheritance of the sect is the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art, which is divided into several parts. In these three years, you all only need to focus on learning the initial part of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art, Sword Energy Elucidation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when he was teaching, his gaze was severe, and he carefully scanned the people in the hall. After he saw that everyone was focused on him, he was satisfied with the situation and his expression softened. Then all 30 students exclaimed as a ray of silver sword light appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ray of silver light looked particularly flexible as it jumped around his palm. The sharp and cold sword light caused no damage to Instructor Zhou’s palm. It was hard to imagine how something like a ray of sword light could exist in such a manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must find it strange. After all, sword light normally disappears once all the spirit force used to create it is used up. So, why can it appear in my hand like his? Once you master the Sword Energy Elucidation, you can do the same. This is merely the beginning of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art. As an outer sect disciple, you can only learn the first chapter. After you successfully cultivate the Sword Energy Elucidation in the next three years and reach the Foundation Realm, then you can enter the inner sect to learn even more profound sword arts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although it is only the initial chapter, three years should be enough for you to cultivate and successfully form your foundation formation to reach the Foundation Realm. Today, take the jade tubes on the table and carefully look at them when you go back. They should contain the Sword Energy Elucidation chapter. Study it well, and if there is anything you don’t understand, come ask me tomorrow. We will end it here today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone slowly recovered from the shock. Everyone knew that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect’s sword art was very strong, and just the little trick Instructor Zhou had shown had aroused everyone’s curiosity. Zhao Jiuge was also very interested. After leaving the mountains, although he had seen many magical treasures, he still preferred the sword. Otherwise, he wouldn't have come here without hesitation even after hearing about the fall of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was very satisfied as he held the jade tube from the table. He had a happy grin and his eyes were filled with anticipation. He was going to go back and study it well tonight.</span></p>
