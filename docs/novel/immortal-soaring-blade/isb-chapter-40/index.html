 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s smile from Su Su waking up froze and the corner of his mouth twitched. He stretched his hair and his lips trembled as if he wanted to say something to refute, but looking at how weak Su Su was, he just let her be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this moment, Zhao Jiuge was so focused on Su Su’s well being that he didn’t notice that Su Su was red up to her ears. The old man’s final violent attack had caught her off guard and knocked her out for a moment. She had just regained consciousness when she saw Zhao Jiuge take out the pill to feed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, when she was in Zhao Jiuge’s arms, she felt very comfortable, but due to her shyness, she pretended to be unconscious. However, who would’ve guessed that when Zhao Jiuge saw that she wasn’t swallowing the Blue Spirit Pill, he would directly kiss her and use his tongue to pry open her teeth. She had never talked to the opposite gender much, and Zhao Jiuge’s powerful kiss had caused her mind to go blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she didn’t blame Zhao Jiuge for the situation, she felt very embarrassed. Her shyness disappeared and she began to pout as she reminisced about the taste of the kiss. It was her very first kiss. Just as she was recalling it, Zhao Jiuge began shaking her again and she took advantage of this moment to hide her thoughts and wake up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su looked at the dumb and honest Zhao Jiuge and revealed a faint smile. She sighed in her heart and thought, “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He really is a block of wood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was sitting on the slope of the big pit. Su Su’s back was leaning against Zhao Jiuge’s stomach and her head was leaning against his chest. The two just remained in this position, and each quietly thought about their own things. If not for the zombie with its belly cut open and the headless, evil old man, what a beautiful picture this would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their gazes met and they just silently looked at each other. Because Zhao Jiuge had secretly kissed her, he felt a bit embarrassed. He mustered his courage and gently said, “This… Is your body feeling better… The Blue Spirit Pill is pretty good medicine…. If you feel better, you should quickly cultivate to absorb spiritual energy.” Because he was so nervous, he stuttered while talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s silly expression, Su Su could not help but roll her eyes and scold that he was ruining the mood! However, since he had spoken, as a girl, she couldn’t shamelessly stay in his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She got up and threw a gaze at Zhao Jiuge before sitting down. She checked her injuries and began to absorb the power from the Blue Spirit Pill. Zhao Jiuge sat there with an inexplicable feeling while he scratched his head, wondering how he had provoked her again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s breathing became even. She found that there weren't many external injuries, but her meridians were a bit damaged and she was running low on spirit force. Otherwise, there weren’t any big problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that during the old man’s final attack, right as the blood-red spirit force was about to touch Su Su, the Purple Jade Glass Shuttle released a powerful burst, protecting Su Su. This magic treasure was left by Su Su’s mother and could not only attack, but also defend. It was a rare treasure that could do both.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, because she was about to be hit, she subconsciously used the little spirit force she had left to defend. This allowed some spirit force to enter her body and caused some damage to her meridians. Now that she had taken the Blue Spirit Pill, a warm feeling flowed through her. She no longer thought about love. She pushed all distractions out of her mind and began to absorb the spiritual energy. Spirit force flowed through her body, repairing her meridians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge watched Su Su gradually enter a state of cultivation. Zhao Jiuge sat there, bored, and thought about many random things. Finally, he gave up and decided to cultivate as well. He had been in fierce battles in these last few days and hadn’t had time to properly cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He became focused and inspected the situation in his body. The golden dragon in his body was damaged and was lying in his dantian with no energy. The old wounds in his body were turning for the better. He thought that after a few days of proper cultivation, he was going to attempt to create the second golden dragon so he could have the power to protect himself. Otherwise, he would be at the mercy of others, which was not a good feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force moved inside his body following his cultivation method, and all the exhaustion from the recent battles surfaced. Zhao Jiuge just sat there, motionless, as he quietly cultivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several hours, the chickens began to cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the sky became visible and light appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was suddenly awakened from his cultivation from the cries of the children. He stood up, stretched his lazy body, and breathed in the fresh air. He felt refreshed and lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Last night, a lot of noise and movement had come from the village’s entrance. All types of sounds and ghostly howls had echoed. The people in the village hadn’t dared to come out to see the lively situation because all the hauntings around this village and the villages nearby had them all scared. The daoist they had gone to invite was not here yet, so they didn’t dare to leave their homes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The movement stopped after midnight and everything became quiet. Every family was curious about what had happened and they all waited in bed for dawn to arrive to satisfy their curiosity, so no one had slept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the chickens’ cries echoed and the day had just begun to light up. All the young and old people in the village rushed toward the entrance of the village. The crowd was even more lively than on new year’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw the Spirit Devouring Zombie that was giving off the smell of a rotting corpse outside the village, they were terrified at what it was. Parents with children blocked their children’s eyes with their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more gathered, and even Su Su stopped cultivating. After several hours, she had recovered from most of her injuries, but her exquisite face was still morbidly pale as she hadn’t fully recovered yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, the entire village entrance was surrounded by a crowd of people, and even people from the nearby village had rushed over. One to ten, ten to 100, and everyone gathered here. Only then did people find that there was a headless old man here as well, the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They looked at the young girl and boy, then they all began to point and talk. At this moment, the white-haired old man who had led Zhao Jiuge and Su Su into the village walked up to ask about what happened last night. He had a heavy expression and stared at the two of them with doubt in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge told the old man what had happened last night and to inform the villagers that the haunting was, in fact, the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder cultivating here. Those pregnant women and lost children had all been cruelly sacrificed by the old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to all of this, the white-haired old man was filled with grief, but he only half believed it. He stared at Zhao Jiuge and Su Su as if they weren’t good people either. After all, something like cultivation was too mysterious to these villagers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Zhao Jiuge didn’t know how to explain, the crowd suddenly opened up and four people walked through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first person was wearing a purple and golden dao hat with a blue and white dao robe. He had a long, white beard and was very thin. He looked to be about 50 to 60 years old—a very elegant-looking old daoist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing next to him was a middle-aged man with a big head and ears wearing white clothes. His face was covered in beads of sweat either from the heat or rushing here—he looked like a villager.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two dao children around Zhao Jiuge’s age behind the old daoist. They were wearing blue and white robes and had their hair tied. On their heads were ordinary cloth hats, and their white faces were slightly red. The dao child on the left held a whisk and the one on the right held a sword wrapped up in shark skin. There was a spirit stone attached to the sword’s handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised Zhao Jiuge was that the old daoist was not holding a wooden sword, but something with an aura he was familiar with. Zhao Jiuge was surprised to find that this old daoist was also a cultivator, but he didn’t understand why a cultivator would do business like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them walked into the crowd. The middle-aged man wiped sweat from his face and was panting as he said to the old man, “Village Chief, I have invited Daoist Yi Qing. Last night, the town was sealed, so I was delayed for a night. We rushed over as soon as dawn broke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The daoist named Yi Qing walked into the crowd and his eyes lit up as he looked at Zhao Jiuge and Su Su. He revealed a faint smile as he stepped forward and said, “Haha, I didn’t expect to meet two people who are in the same profession as me, and so young. This old daoist is called Yi Qing. Once this matter is over, if you two don’t mind, you can come visit this poor daoist’s place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elegant temperaments, friendly smiles, and humble gestures made people feel comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s mouth was stupid. He smiled but didn’t know how to follow up. It was Su Su who revealed a faint smile and nodded. She glanced at Zhao Jiuge. “Then we will trouble you. Please help the villagers deal with the matter here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Yi Qing nodded and walked toward the white-haired village chief to ask about the situation. When he saw the Spirit Devouring Zombie with its belly split open and the old man with the severed head, he couldn’t help but lose all color in his face. “No respect to the heavens and committed evil. In the end, they taste their own bitter fruit.”</span></p>
