 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light that appeared in the room caused the two people, who were originally jokingly scolding Zhao Jiuge, to become dumbfounded. Their eyes were filled with desire while they looked at the two flying swords. Their mouths were slightly open and they couldn’t respond for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, it was Luo Xie who couldn’t endure it anymore. He raised his brows and asked Zhao Jiuge in shock, “These are for us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng’s gaze followed Luo Xie’s toward Zhao Jiuge. Previously, he had seen Zhao Jiuge sell 29 magic treasures in the Treasure Pavilion. He knew that what Zhao Jiuge had said was true and that two flying swords meant nothing to him. Even so, Leng Rufeng couldn’t help but feel a sense of warmth flow through his body. He clenched his teeth and looked at Zhao Jiuge with a complicated gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Call me ‘big brother’ first.” Zhao Jiuge smiled and pretended to be arrogant. He held the two shining flying swords before him, acting all cool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother…” Luo Xie affectionately called him big brother several times. He rushed forward and hugged Zhao Jiuge, but his eyes were locked on to the flying swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had done missions for a long time and still hadn’t earned much sect contributions. He hadn’t gone to the Treasure Pavilion because he knew he didn’t have enough. Instead of wasting time, he spent it cultivating so he could reach the Foundation Realm sooner. Leng Rufeng had almost 200 sect contributions, which was barely enough to buy one. However, who knew that the news of the training would send all the new disciples across the three peaks to the Treasure Pavilion. All the cheap ones were taken and Leng Rufeng couldn’t afford the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, Leng Rufeng was more than capable enough to earn his own flying sword, but in order to take care of Luo Xie, who was weak, he always went out on missions in a group. He was the strongest and did most of the work, but he always divided the sect contributions equally without complaint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, when Zhao Jiuge suddenly took two shining flying swords out and said he was going to give the swords to them, how could they not be happy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw Luo Xie’s reaction, he couldn’t help but laugh. He knocked aside Luo Xie’s hands and laughed. “You don’t even have a bit of pride at all. You should learn from Leng Rufeng, look at how strong-willed he is, unlike you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was saying this, he still handed the two flying swords to them. He gave the grey flying sword to Leng Rufeng and the blood-colored flying sword to Luo Xie. Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but enjoy watching the two of them smile. As long as his brothers were happy, he was satisfied. Due to his childhood, he especially cherished his friendships. Even though he really wanted to forge a flying sword, he still chose to share for the sake of his brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie accepted the blood-colored flying sword with a silly smile. He carefully examined it and could not let it go. As a new disciple, it was very satisfying to finally have his own flying sword. With his friendship with Zhao Jiuge, he was not going to act polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Leng Rufeng, he only smiled faintly and tightly held the grey flying sword, his fingers turning somewhat white. Even though he was just as excited in his heart, he didn’t show it. When he saw Zhao Jiuge look at him, he simply said, “I won’t bother with words of gratitude. I’ll remember it in my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caused Zhao Jiuge to smile and pat his shoulder. Then Zhao Jiuge helplessly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng smiled. Some things were better off remaining buried in his heart. Words sometimes couldn’t express how one felt properly. Some things needed action and time to be proven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another flash of light before Zhao Jiuge’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Here are some spirit stones. There are 300 for each of you, take them to practice. Luo Xie, you brat, you better hurry up and enter the Foundation Realm so we can enter the inner sect together.” After Zhao Jiuge finished speaking, he handed the hundreds of colorful spirit stones to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he had almost 7,000 spirit stones left. When he entered the sect, Wang Baiwan had given him 2,000 and he had wasted a bit attempting to cultivate the third golden dragon. Then he obtained 6,000 to 7,000 from Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn, when did you become so rich? Where did you get all these?” Luo Xie was already very happy, and he quickly snatched the spirit stones. Today was just one surprise after another. With these spirit stones, he was much more confident in reaching the Foundation Realm before the selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These spirit stones were filled with spirit force and were much faster compared to absorbing the spiritual energy in the air. It would save him the work of converting the spiritual energy into spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smile on Leng Rufeng’s face became even more intense, but he didn’t speak. He thought that one day, he would leave &nbsp;his mark in this powerful sect. One day, he would leave his footprint in the vast Huaxia Dynasty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Luo Xie’s lack of discipline, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but interrupt him and change the topic. “When does the training start? Weren’t the instructors supposed to tell us the details of the training?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie held the blood-colored flying sword and gently waved it around. He casually said, “The training will be in half a month. The day after tomorrow, we have to gather at the Mysterious Heaven Peak. All the new disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak will be there, and the three instructors will tell us the details.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Luo Xie seemed to have played with the blood-colored flying sword in his hand enough. He remembered the spirit stones and muttered, “I’m going to cultivate. I have to hurry and reach the Foundation Realm. The two of you can chat without me.” Then he climbed back onto his wooden bed. He took out some spirit stones to test their effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Leng Rufeng both looked at Luo Xie, who looked like a different person now. They smiled at each other and gently shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, I’ll go and test out this flying sword. Then I need to prepare for the training. I’ll see you the day after tomorrow.” Leng Rufeng also prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t try to ask him to stay. After all, he had just gotten back and was very tired. He also had a lot of things to do, like preparing for the training and consolidating his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He watched Leng Rufeng go until he disappeared completely. Then Zhao Jiuge closed the door to the courtyard and returned to his wooden bed. He didn’t enter a cultivation state like before but began to think about things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In two short years, he had changed from an ordinary boy from a mountain village to someone at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm with two precious treasures. He also had about 7,000 spirit stones, more than 8,000 sect contributions, and about 100 kilograms of Purple Ji Spirit Stone. There was also the armor that was going to be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had also grown from 15 years old to 17 years old. The experience in the last two years felt like a dream. He didn’t know how far he had walked down this road, but he knew that as long as he did his best, his strength would increase over time. As long as he didn’t do anything that he couldn’t accept in his heart, it was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about how there was still half a month until the training, Zhao Jiuge felt a headache. This would completely mess up his plans. He was going to rest for a few days before heading out to do the last mission. However, now he was afraid that half a month was not enough time to get back, and he had to push back refining his armor to a later date too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After thinking for a while, he decided he would ask Bai Qingqing for her opinion when everyone gathered at the Mysterious Heaven Peak Square to get the details about the training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he looked at the serious Luo Xie and couldn’t help but chuckle. He also closed his eyes and entered a state of cultivation. The Sanskrit Heart Sutra activated and slowly restored his spirit force. After each major battle, his spirit force would be depleted. This would help increase his cultivation level greatly.</span></p>

Right now, he was only at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm, so there were no bottlenecks to speak of. He only needed time to reach the late stage of the Foundation Realm.</span></p>

Thinking about how Bai Qingqing normally was and the Bai Qingqing now, Zhao Jiuge felt like she was a bit abnormal, a little strange.</span></p>
