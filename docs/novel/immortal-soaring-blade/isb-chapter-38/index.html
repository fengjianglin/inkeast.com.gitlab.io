 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything in the world had a spirit, and some of the things that could be born in this vast world were zombies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zombies were born when people were buried in land filled with spiritual energy. This would result in the corpse not rotting completely, and after a period of incubation, it would become a so-called zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first stage of a zombie was called White Zombie. After a body was buried for a few years and was nourished by spiritual energy, white hair would begin to grow on its body. Its body would be stiff and its movements would be slow, making it very easy to deal with, and it would be afraid of sunlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second stage of a zombie was called Black Zombie. A White Zombie that had drained animal blood for a few years would later have all its white hair fall off, leaving short, black hair. At this time, it would still be afraid of the sun and fire and its actions would be slow. However, it would no longer be afraid of animals and would enjoy sucking their blood, but it would still be afraid of humans. If it encountered a human, it would turn away, but people who were asleep could find a Black Zombie secretly sucking their blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third stage of a zombie was called Green Hair Zombie, or also Jumping Zombie. After decades of being a Black Zombie, the black hair would fade and it would be no different from when it was buried, besides its long, green nails. A Green Hair Zombie could run and jump very fast and had metal-like bones. It was also very strong, and even a dog that loved to bark would not dare to bark before it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fourth stage of a zombie was called Purple Zombie, or the Flying Zombie. This stage would be reached after a Green Hair Zombie had absorbed the essence of the moon for hundreds of years. It could jump dozens of meters like it was flying and could absorb a person’s soul without leaving any external wounds—it was very proficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fifth stage of a zombie was a demon-like existence called Drought Demon. After a Purple Zombie absorbed souls for hundreds of years, its appearance would become even more ferocious. It could be even said to be a ferocious-looking demon. It could even change its body to fool people. It could slaughter dragons in the sky and summon the plague god below. All plagues and droughts in the world came from them. Once a Drought Demon appeared, the surrounding thousands of kilometers would turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last type of zombie was a legendary existence called Hou. It was no longer a zombie and could be comparable to an immortal. In the entire history of the dynasty, the figure of a Hou had only appeared once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder had his eyes closed in the air and started to mutter. He used his right hand to activate the bell and his mind to control the Spirit Devouring Zombie. This zombie was originally an ordinary Green Hair Zombie that had been in the unmarked graves for decades. The old man had gone to the unmarked graves to prepare for long term cultivation and had met it by luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man had dealt with corpses for a long time and cultivated an evil method. When he saw the Green Hair Zombie, he immediately had an idea. Then he spent a lot of spirit materials on the zombie to refine it into its current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Body changed by yin energy, scarlet-red eyes, hook-like fingers, exposed sharp teeth, mouth filled with a foul stench, and a heavy smell of blood. It absorbed spirit force as food, and the old man had been feeding it with his own blood every day. During a time of crisis, the old man would control the zombie to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold gust continued to blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Devouring Zombie was like a hungry zombie, and it charged forward with bloodthirst. Zhao Jiuge was shocked and rolled to the side in panic. He rolled between the legs of the Spirit Devouring Zombie. There was some dirt on its clothes and strands of hair scattered before his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After missing, the zombie suddenly turned 180 degrees and its hands reached out. Its eyes were filled with bloodthirst as it pounced at Zhao Jiuge again. When Zhao Jiuge saw the sharp nails, his heart turned cold. Light flashed in his hand as he formed a long sword light and struck down on the zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword light released a muffled bang and then scattered. The zombie’s body only trembled slightly and wasn’t affected at all. Zhao Jiuge felt like his cheeks had been cut by the wind and was completely caught off guard. He could only watch as the claws of the zombie magnified!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Su moved. The purple jade hairpin released a noble light as it flew forward. It arrived before the zombie and forced it back several steps. The zombie’s leg dragged across the land, creating two streaks on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s tight expression became even more serious. This purple jade hairpin was called the Purple Jade Shuttle. It was something Su Su’s mother had given her when she was young. It was only a little weaker than an Immortal Treasure, because it had no treasure soul, but it was still considered the best among magic treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t think that the Purple Jade Glass Shuttle would only knock the zombie back without injuring it. She gently helped Zhao Jiuge as her beautiful eyes looked at him with concern. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge patted the dust off his body and gently shook his head. He looked viciously at the Spirit Devouring Zombie. He was filled with anger from being chased by the zombie for so long, so he shouted, “Today, if there is him, then there is no me. If there is me, then there is no him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su originally had a worried expression, but she suddenly broke out in laughter. In the eyes of a lover, even Zhao Jiuge’s anger was very cute, causing Su Su’s heart to smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was still floating in the sky with his eyes closed, continuing to chant. As the bell continued to chime, the zombie became even more lively. Zhao Jiuge looked like a mess, but he completely disregarded everything as he gathered his spirit force outside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force gathered to form a giant sword, then he rushed toward the zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang, bang...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt his hand go numb from the collision and was even forced back a few steps, while the zombie remained still as if it hadn’t even felt a thing. There were only a few white marks on its skin. Zhao Jiuge revealed a self-deprecating smile. With his cultivation at the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, he couldn’t even cause the zombie to move an inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The unsuspecting Zhao Jiuge knew that this Spirit Devouring Zombie was originally refined from a Green Hair Zombie. Its body was as strong as metal and it had been refined by the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder with all kinds of materials as well. Its body was so strong that even when the old man used his own spirit force, he had trouble damaging the zombie!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Spirit Devouring Zombie also had a fatal weakness—it had a strong physical body but no intelligence. The old man had to use his own mind to control it with the help of the Soul Summon Bell. Thus, the zombie would lose its flexibility, and he would only stay in place while he controlled the zombie to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su helped Zhao Jiuge stabilize himself, and her eyes narrowed. When Zhao Jiuge attacked just now, she saw something strange. When the sword created by Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force landed, the grey gas around the zombie had shrunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, the light from Zhao Jiuge’s sword obviously dimmed for a moment. It was a technique to reduce the force of impact. It was equal to Zhao Jiuge using 100% of his strength, but only 70% of this strength had landed on the zombie’s body. The other 30% had been absorbed by the zombie to replenish itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This discovery suddenly caused Su Su’s expression to change. The old man with his eyes closed smiled and thought that they finally realized how strong he was. “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You are too inexperienced to think you can defeat me with just a few treasures. Did you think this old man would be easy to deal with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This zombie was the old man’s pride. After he successfully refined it, he had only used it a few times, and there was rarely a need to use it around Dong Yang City. The few occasions he had used it were when he met powerful adversaries, and even the most difficult cultivators he had faced had been dealt with easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gust of wind surrounded the zombie as it moved its powerful body and charged at the two of them with its sharp claws out. This time, Su Su decided to test if her discovery was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t use the purple jade hairpin, she directly applied her own spirit force. Her Foundation Realm spirit force gathered in her palm as the zombie got closer and closer. The disgusting smell of the rotting corpse became even more intense, but Su Su didn’t even blink. The spirit force gathered in her hand shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven meters, five meters, three meters—the zombie was about to touch her long, black dress in the next second. Su Su’s delicate hand suddenly rose up with shocking spirit force and created a large palm before it smashed down onto the zombie to Zhao Jiuge's shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This palm was heaven-shaking, and even the moonlight covered by the dark clouds revealed itself. Zhao Jiuge, who was standing behind Su Su, only felt his ears ring as if he lost his hearing for a short period of time. The palm smashed into the zombie, creating a huge shockwave that blew back Su Su’s long black hair, revealing her white and beautiful neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked from the side and felt that Su Su’s side view was very elegant. The rage from being chased like a dog from before completely disappeared—he was now intoxicated by Su Su’s temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom...</span></p>
