 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eight-Triagram Disk was created by Daoists and was used by them habitually. It was one of the major three treasures a Daoist would have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The center of the disk was a black and white Tai Chi symbol. Surrounding it were the four divisions. Then it was split into Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xu, Kan, Li, Gen, Dui. It symbolized one splitting into two, yin and yang. Then the two splitting into the four divisions and then four splitting into the eight characters. This represented everything under the heavens and the eight attributes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivation method that the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had obtained through luck belonged to the Li branch of Daoism. The Li branch was well suited to catching ghosts, and the most famous of these cultivation methods was the Zhu Rong Doctrine and Charms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daoists had three treasures: a whisk, a plum wood sword, and an Eight-Triagram Disk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the disk that was buzzing in the sky looked like it was going to explode from the spirit force injected into it. The black and white Tai Chi symbol at the center slowly started rotating, then the surrounding eight characters seemed to rotate as well. Finally, under the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s gaze, the “Kan” character shined brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had a gloomy expression ever since he noticed the yin energy, but now his expression eased a bit. He seemed to be relieved and said, "It's not bad. It is at the Kan water symbol. The sun is trapped in the yin, danger hidden within danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing how everyone here, including Yu Qingshan, was attracted by his actions and listening to his words, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery paused. After wetting everyone’s appetite enough, he smiled and continued, “Fortunately, Daoism is suited for catching ghosts. Although the matter is a bit tricky, everything is under my control. What happened at the ancestral home was caused by some yin objects—this was confirmed by my Eight-Triagram Disk. However, as for what specific object it is, I'll have to head into the village to know. From the look of his yin energy, although it hasn’t formed a yin climate, it's not something to be underestimated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery retrieved the disk and gave it back to his disciple. He still had that faint smile on his face, and he stroked his beard while watching the Yu family members.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strange appearance of the Eight-Triagram Disk had already shocked Yu Qingshan, his wife, the children, and the servants. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s otherworldly appearance and actions made them admire him even more. In comparison, Zhao Jiuge hadn’t done anything since arriving and was immediately worse in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yu family members were all smiling while looking at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery—they had completely forgotten about Zhao Jiuge. Only Yu Qiusheng and Yu Xiasheng looked at the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery and then at Zhao Jiuge. When they saw that Zhao Jiuge still had that calm expression, the two of them began to whisper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Daoist, since you know the solution, you must help our family. My entire family will be forever grateful.” Yu Qingshan was completely convinced by the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s actions. When he heard what the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery said, he pleaded sincerely and almost knelt down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery pulled Yu Qingshan up. He had a kind smile as he said, “What are you talking about? This is what we should do. Rest assured, we will enter the village and wait for night to come, then I’ll resolve this problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s answer, Yu Qingshan’s face was filled with gratitude. The stone that had been weighing on his heart for months had finally disappeared. He immediately called his wife over and bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery was filled with smiles and accepted the bow. He also glanced at Zhao Jiuge in a provocative manner. Yu Qingshan had already noticed that the two didn’t get along, but because the problem was still weighing on his heart, he had to ask both for help. Now that he had witnessed the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s might, he pretended not to see anything. With how young Zhao Jiuge was, Yu Qingshan believed in the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery more, but he wasn’t dumb enough to say it. The only exceptions were Yu Qiusheng and Yu Xiasheng—everyone else believed in the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery more. Yu Qiusheng envied how handsome Zhao Jiuge looked with the flying sword, and Yu Xiasheng was on his side because of her own intuition and curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the provocative gaze from the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery, Zhao Jiuge pretended he didn’t see. His face was as calm as water, but countless ripples spread in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had really shocked Zhao Jiuge. This was the first time Zhao Jiuge had seen a Daoist in action, and it was really the work of another faction. Zhao Jiuge was amazed at how wondrous the world was, and he really wanted to see all those places. This made Zhao Jiuge want to improve his cultivation even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge silently pondered. The calmness on the surface was only there to hide his inner unease. He had no experience, so he could only see that the village contained a large amount of yin energy. Yin energy was like spiritual energy, but it contained heavy yin attributes. Aside from that, Zhao Jiuge knew nothing about what was happening at night. He was like a blind man crossing a river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was suddenly lost in thought, and this made him look even more calm and aloof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After accepting the Eight-Triagram Disk, the boy carefully put it away inside the purplish-gold bag on his waist. He then looked at the dozen or so people from the Yu family who looked at him in worship, which made the boy feel very happy and proud for his master. Then he looked at Zhao Jiuge and saw his calm expression that was so different from everyone else’s. This made the boy angry in his heart, and the proud smile on his face immediately disappeared. Even he didn’t know why he had become so angry when he saw Zhao Jiuge’s calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the proud smile disappeared from his face, the boy’s brow furrowed. He then said in a strange tone, "Who was it that was so arrogant before? Now that you’re there, you’re too afraid to even make a fart? Is it because you feel the gloomy aura here and are too scared?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were extremely vicious—this was not something such a young child should be able to say!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery still had that fake smile on his face and let his disciple act as he wished. He allowed his disciple to test Zhao Jiuge’s limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing such provocative words, Yu Qingshan’s dim eyes suddenly lit up. He wished for the world to become more chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Xiasheng’s panicked face gradually calmed down after the Eight-Triagram Disk was put away. When she first met Zhao Jiuge, she was filled with curiosity. Although Zhao Jiuge was young, Yu Xiasheng’s sixth sense told her that he wasn’t simple. Previously, the easygoing Zhao Jiuge was able to match the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s aura in the family hall, so she knew Zhao Jiuge was not as simple as he appeared. However, Zhao Jiuge hadn’t done anything, which made her a bit disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the next moment, her beautiful eyes widened in shock and her delicate body trembled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Noisy. You just look like a dog that only knows how to bark. Careful that your tongue doesn't get chopped off.” Zhao Jiuge snorted lightly and his brow furrowed angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing Zhao Jiuge’s anger, the little Daoist boy was not afraid and continued taunting, “Look at your poor appearance, you don’t even have a good treasure. Aside from that sword, you have nothing, while my master has treasures inside and out. I fear your strength is no match either. If you don’t have the ability, don’t come out to practice. Go back and learn from your teacher’s wife again.” After speaking, the little boy laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the Yu family members all became very colorful. This child was so young, yet he was first class at dishing out insults without using any dirty words. Even Yu Qingshan’s old face became strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Learn from your teacher’s wife. So simple yet so meaningful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, Zhao Jiuge did not look poor at all. The sword robe was made by the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect and had silver silk embroidered on it. The Blue Plum Sword on his back while not a high level treasure, but it was still outstanding among common treasures. He had the jade token on his waist that added a bit of mystery to his style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a scholar meets a soldier, even if the scholar has reason, he won’t be able to explain it to the soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had always been introverted—he had only become more social after he stepped onto the path of cultivation. With that in mind how could he compete with this little Daoist boy? At this moment, he didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only felt his chest become stuffy, and his body trembled from anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the little Daoist boy saw Zhao Jiuge’s expression, he became even more courageous. He added more fuel to the fire, saying, “What, are you angry because I spoke the truth? Just look at yourself, what do you have?” After he spoke, he arrogantly looked into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt his face become hot. He was introverted and not good with words. How could he be afraid of the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery and the little Daoist boy? Not to mention that he was here on behalf of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Zhao Jiuge became furious and let out a roar. “What a good dog. I’ll cut off that tongue of yours and let you see what I’m made of!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When one couldn’t speak reason, it was time to speak with one’s fists. Facing the vicious, little Daoist boy, Zhao Jiuge could not endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bright sword light erupted without warning. The silver sword light flew out toward the little Daoist boy. The air was filled with the pressure of a Spirit Transformation Realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge no longer hid his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I only have a sword, but I can also get rid of demons.” The Blue Plum Sword on Zhao Jiuge’s back suddenly appeared in his right hand. He held the sword at a 45 degree angle, and blue light moved through the sword like electric snakes. The pressure made Zhao Jiuge’s sword robe flutter, and the black cloth tying his hair trembled when his aura erupted. Even the calm Madam Yu was shocked by this. Zhao Jiuge’s eyes became cold and were filled with killing intent when he suddenly said, “I can also chop off your damn tongue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge erupted his aura, how could the people of the Yu family resist? Their faces all turned pale. Only Yu Xiasheng endured it and said, “Extremely cool!” Afterward, her face burned a bit red like she had remembered something, or maybe it was due to the pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Qiusheng feared nothing. After his big sister spoke, he followed up, saying “Satisfying, I like it.” Looking at how handsome Zhao Jiuge was. Yu Qiusheng was extremely envious. He completely forgot about the pain from the pressure and only thought about how cool Zhao Jiuge was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Daoist boy facing Zhao Jiuge’s sword aura didn’t have it so good. At this moment, he finally shut his mouth. His face was ashen and his body was trembling. Right now, he felt like the sword light was the only thing that existed in this world. The sky, this place, this village—everything seemed to have disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s fake smile had disappeared and he was now staring at Zhao Jiuge. He found that Zhao Jiuge’s aura was no weaker than his, and even a bit stronger. This made him feel dread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t have too much time to think, because that sword light was about to pierce his disciple. “Hmph, even if you hit a dog, you have to see who its master is.” After he spoke with a gloomy tone, he waved his hand and the gourd on his waist moved. The crystal gourd flew into his hand and then he threw it into the air. A jet of air came out of the gourd, and the sword light that was filled with spirit force was pulled into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This shocked Zhao Jiuge greatly. This scene was too strange, and it caught Zhao Jiuge off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was shocked and wondered what kind of treasure it was to have such power. Zhao Jiuge was panicking a bit when he saw the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s expression, and he suddenly had a thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The records in the sect said that the more powerful a treasure was, the greater the spirit force consumption, and they would have very harsh conditions to use. Things like immortal treasures may drain the user of all their spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw how gloomy the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery looked. Presumably, the price for forcibly absorbing the sword light into the guard was not cheap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had absorbed the sword light by force, he felt extremely bitter. Not only had he used up a lot of his spirit force, he even had to reluctantly use spirit stones in fear of Zhao Jiuge attacking again. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery’s eyes were filled with fear as quickly said, “If you want to fight, save it for tonight. We can decide the winner by seeing who can deal with the matter first. If we fight now, we will just injure each other. Is there any point to that?” Even though he said this, he really wasn’t confident in facing off against Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was also uncertain. The Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery had too many treasures, while he only had a sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking advantage of the situation, he said, “Then we will see tonight.” Afterward, he let out a cold snort and walked into the village first. He left behind the figure of his back to the crowd and the gloomy-looking Lord of the Qing Feng Monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no one noticed that during the fierce face-off between the two, the yin energy over the village dissipated a bit. It was as if the yin energy had felt the suppression and hid itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s back, the faces of the Yu family members changed again. Only Yu Qiusheng’s face was filled with worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out a breath with his back toward him, his momentum was high. He no longer looked as confused and trepid as when he first came to the village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After releasing that sword light, Zhao Jiuge felt satisfied, and he also came to understand something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword was a killing weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivating the sword relied on moving forward with determination and without hesitation. Once you hesitate, you will lose your sword’s sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flash, momentum surged from Zhao Jiuge’s heart.</span></p>
