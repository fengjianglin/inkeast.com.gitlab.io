 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhao Jiuge walked up the wooden stairs, the crisp sound that echoed with each step seemed to knock on his heart. Although he had finally entered the building and came to a sect like he had always dreamed of, he couldn’t help but feel nervous and excited about what was going to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned a corner and walked up a few more steps before he saw light. The second floor was similar to the first floor, but it was very crowded and noisy. After careful observation, he saw that everyone in the second floor had some spirit force fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t stay for too long before he continued to the third floor. He remembered the middle-aged man’s words, and Zhao Jiuge really cherished this opportunity. He was afraid of making any small mistakes that would delay this good opportunity to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, who is this to be able to go to the third floor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ya, all of us at the Blood Movement Realm are only on the second floor, and the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect only accepts people below the Foundation realm. Could it be another person at the Spirit Transformation Realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Definitely. Didn’t you see that all those that went up all had extraordinary auras? I really want to see what’s different about the third floor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, there is nothing for them to be proud of. Let us take things slowly. It all depends on the future as cultivation is slow and we have all just started. It's far too early for them to be proud.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhao Jiuge made his way toward the third floor, the people on the second floor began to talk. They looked at Zhao Jiuge’s back with various different emotions in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same situation, but the people were different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most eye-catching was naturally the white-robed Bai Zimo, he had a youthful face yet was very vicious. At this moment, he was standing with his hands behind his back, looking out the window. When he heard someone walk up, he elegantly turned around and looked toward the staircase. When he saw that it wasn’t someone from the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he suddenly frowned and carefully observed Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A similarly handsome face, but a bit less childish and more determined. There was no viciousness and a bit more friendliness. However, when Bai Zimo found that the person had a weaker spirit force, his pride was basically written on his face. He was filled with unexplainable hostility toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Bai Zimo observed Zhao Jiuge, Zhao Jiuge only glanced without really looking at Bai Zimo, because there were three more figures with auras no weaker than his in the room. Two males and one female.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were similar to Zhao Jiuge in age. Among the three, he first observed the girl. She was beautiful, but perhaps because he had been with Su Su for too long, his standards had increased or something. He felt nothing toward this girl and slightly observed her. She was still growing, but her skin was white and delicate. When she saw that Zhao Jiuge was looking at her, her face turned slightly red and she pretended to look elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the two guys, one was thin and small, with a lecherous gaze locked on the girl’s chest. From time to time, he would swallow. Even when Zhao Jiuge came up, he didn’t look over, he just continued to stare at the girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other was very fat, like a ball of meat. His small eyes looked at Zhao Jiuge with a smile. When he sat on a chair, his body formed layers like strips of fat. Zhao Jiuge had a good feeling about him because this person gave off an honest feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the fatty saw Zhao Jiuge, his eyes lit up. Zhao Jiuge felt that the fatty was looking at him with the same gaze the lecherous youth was staring at the girl’s chest. This made Zhao Jiuge feel uncomfortable, and even his steps became a bit uneven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, another one came, and it’s a cool and handsome guy.” A voice filled with joy came from the meaty face. He even raised his hand to wave at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge smiled back and gently nodded, but he didn’t know what to say. Ever since he left the mountain village, meeting the Mo family at Dong Yang City and then meeting Su Su had gradually changed him. If meeting Bo Re at the cold pool was a change to his heart, then meeting Su Su was a change to his personality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The confusion he felt when he first stepped onto the path of cultivation had turned into determination, and this decided his goals. Later, his originally shy personality became more open and lively. Everything was changing with time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time was really a good thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge didn’t speak, the little fatty revealed a warm smile and the flesh on his face trembled. “My name is Wang Baiwan<span id="footnote-ref-ef7d"><a href="#footnote-ef7d">[1]</a></span>, what is your name?” After he finished speaking, he stared at Zhao Jiuge with a curious gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Jiuge.” Zhao Jiuge clenched his teeth and endured his urge to laugh. Wang Baiwan—that name almost made Zhao Jiuge burst out in laughter. When he said this name, the vulgar youth &nbsp;finally noticed Zhao Jiuge’s arrival and observed him with a lecherous gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the little girl took a few steps to stand before everyone, her face slightly red as she listened to the teenagers talk. However, when Bai Zimo saw this, he let out a cold snort and turned to look out the window with undisguised disdain on his face. He stood far away, next to the bed, as if he didn’t want to be associated with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, my name is Luo Xie and I’m 15 this year. I’m still single and my house has three acres of poor farm land. I am from a poor family and seeking a spouse.” After he finished speaking, he was still glancing at the girl. His smile still gave off a lecherous feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl saw that everyone had introduced themselves. She hesitated for a bit and then boldly said, “My name is Liu Yinger.” Her face was slightly red and her voice was so small, it was pitiful. If Zhao Jiuge wasn’t listening carefully, he wouldn't have known what she had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Liu Yinger’s soft words, the eyes of the lecherous Luo Xie became even brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I’m so happy to meet you all, unlike some other people, hmph. Later, once we enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, all the spirit stones required for cultivation will be on me.” Wang Baiwan laughed. While he spoke, he looked at Bai Zimo, who was beside the bed in the distance. The corner of his mouth curved to show his disdain toward Bai Zimo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know whether to cry or laugh as he looked at the three strange people before him. Wang Baiwan was dressed nicely, and from his proud words, his family should be good. But he didn’t have the aura of someone from a good family and was rather like a child. Also, considering how he had said that he would cover all the spirit stones needed for cultivation, his family was not ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has to be said in the latter part of cultivation, spirit stones were a must. Whether it was cultivation or practicing spells, everyone required spirit stones. At the same time, spirit stone were something everyone used. Only at this moment did Zhao Jiuge remember the 2,000 spirit stones Mo Longjie had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The delicate and shy Liu Yinger, there was nothing special about this girl that Zhao Jiuge could see. However, if they were both going to enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, then they would have time to slowly get to know each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, there was Luo Xie. Although he had a lecherous look, he should be a fairly straightforward person that didn’t plot behind your back, only he was a bit lecherous. Zhao Jiuge didn’t know if it was the way they talked or acted, but it was the first impression Zhao Jiuge had of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the last person, it was Bai Zimo. He had already been classified by Zhao Jiuge as someone who he shouldn’t befriend. Not only was Bai Zimo arrogant, he was far too vicious and not fit to be a friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the path of cultivation, one should make many friends to pass difficulties together, and no one would be willing to befriend people with bad personalities. After all, when they went on an adventure together and encountered a treasure that moved them, they would always stab you in the back. Cultivation not only required perseverance and talent, but also opportunities. When one cultivated, they often had many mysterious items assisting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, given Zhao Jiuge’s personality from growing up in a small, remote mountain village, he would not take the initiative to make friends with people. Perhaps the current Zhao Jiuge was very reticent; however, it wasn’t because his personality was cold, but because he didn’t know how to better communicate with people. After all, he grew up only with the respectful old man from childhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, these youngsters all began to talk together and slowly became familiar with each other. There was talk and laughter, but Bai Zimo, who stood alone, didn’t feel good. He was arrogant and didn’t like being ignored. He wanted to talk to them as well but would not lower his head. He thought that once they entered the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, they would come to beg to talk to him one day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knock, knock, knock...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as everyone was happily talking about their own encounters and lives, a sound came from the wooden stair. Everyone subconsciously looked toward the stars. Even the arrogant Bai Zimo turned his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, what appeared before everyone was a beautiful face. As Luo Xie stared at the beautiful face and swallowed, the person with the beautiful face walked up. This person was wearing a robe that black as ink, with the cuffs and collar embroidered in gold. They were male clothes, and this person held a jade fan that shined brightly in their hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This contrast made Luo Xie disappointed. He originally thought it was a beautiful woman, but when he saw the male clothes, he was depressed. He no longer looked at this charming teenager, he went back to looking at Liu Yinger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Zhao Jiuge was secretly surprised that there could be such a beautiful man. He was born more beautiful than women, like someone from a painting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While everyone was looking at the charming teenager, the charming teenager was curiously looking back at the people on the third floor. He saw that Bai Zimo was by himself and that the few other people were gathered around Zhao Jiuge. He hesitated a bit before walking toward the group of people and not Bai Zimo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My name is Mu Zijun, it is a great honor to join the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect with everyone.” He held the jade fan in his hand as he clasped his hands and bowed slightly with a smile on this face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already had a white and beautiful face, and his long, black hair shifted as he bowed. Along with his beautiful smile, humble words, and already beautiful face, he left a good impression on everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zhao Jiuge muttered in his heart. Why so many disciples with rich backgrounds? After just a look at the fan, he could tell that it was not an ordinary magical treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Zijun’s appearance interrupted the conversation, and everyone had to reintroduce themselves. Mu Zijun also integrated very well into this small group. Everyone happily and harmoniously laughed. If anyone were to look at Bai Zimo, they would see that his chest was heaving up and down. This was from pure anger of being ignored. From his birth, he had always had people gather around his noble self. When had he ever been ignored like this?</span></p>
