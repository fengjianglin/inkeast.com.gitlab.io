 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the loveliness of the beauty in the pink palace dress, the nobleness and coldness of the plain-clothed woman next to her attracted the young man’s heart more. The age of 13 was when one’s feelings were still hazy, so the attracting to the opposite sex had a different feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with passion and he was breathing rapidly as he subconsciously muttered, “So beautiful!” The woman in the pink dress frowned slightly as she proudly looked down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no expression on her face, as if she was looking down on an ant. “Senior Sister Bo Re, it is merely a wild child.” Her voice was pleasant but very arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plain-clothed woman didn’t respond to what she said, as if nothing could catch her interest. She looked at the deep, cold pool and didn’t even look at the youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A moment later, the plain-clothed woman asked, “Are you sure this is the place?” Her voice was soft but had no emotion at all. It could freeze anyone within thousands of kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Sister Bo Re, this is the place. A few months ago, I passed by this place and the devil flood dragon unexpectedly absorbed the spiritual energy here and created a ray of light that shined around the pool.” When the woman in the pink dress looked at the woman in plain clothes, there was a hint of fear in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, the plain-clothed woman touched her chin and said, “Go lure it out.” Her voice was very commanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was still immersed in their dialogue when he found out that the cold pool had an evil flood dragon that would come out to cultivate from time to time. He thought about how he had cultivated inside the pool for several days. He was lucky that the flood dragon hadn’t come out, or else it would have swallowed him whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that they were about to fly toward the pool, his heart tightened as if he was going to lose something. This hesitation caused his breathing to become unstable and the spirit force inside his body to become chaotic. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something to the plain-clothed woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the fluctuations of spirit force, the plain-clothed woman was surprised and raised her brow a little. Her gaze moved toward the source of the fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She only saw a youth in black clothes that appeared worned out standing at the edge of the cliff. His long hair was tied by a single piece of black cloth and on his shoulder was a nervous, little monkey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth looked very young and his gaze was hot. After experiencing the gazes of all the famous disciples from the various sects, the plain-clothed woman understood what the youth was thinking. At this moment, his youthful and handsome face became rose red and his breathing became rough. His hands nervously grasped his clothes and he looked very helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was late at night and deep in the mountains. On one party was a youth and a monkey, while the other was two cold and noble ladies. It was a very strange scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plain-clothed woman only took one glance and then withdrew her gaze. She then steered the dragon boat toward the surface of the pool. This whole time, she had only taken a quick glance at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth opened his mouth, but due to her gaze, he was too nervous to speak. He was from a small mountain village and had never had any friends to talk to, much less someone of the opposite sex. This made him very shy and very formal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to that glance, the originally shy face’s color and his slightly opened mouth closed shut. That glance shattered the little confidence this little mountain village youth had gathered. That glance had damaged the fragile self-esteem of this little mountain village youth. That glance had caused his world view to change drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth’s hands clenched tightly into fists, and because he was using so much force, the veins on his hands bulged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did I risk my soul being destroyed to take the first step onto the path of cultivation!? What do I want!? If my heart doesn’t know what I want, then what dao can I seek? How can I pursue the elusive path to become an immortal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperors and the common people were all mortals that would eventually die. Some cultivate to escape growing old and live forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even thousands of armored cavalry could compare to the might of heaven. Some people cultivated to pursue power beyond mortal means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world was mysterious and filled with spiritual energy. The stars were vast and the path to immortality was difficult to find. Some people pursued the path to become immortal to seek out the mysteries of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do I seek? Didn’t I cultivate so I could get revenge and right the wrongs in the world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do I seek? Didn’t I cultivate so I could happily stand above all and look down on all life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do I seek? Didn’t I cultivate so I could kill all the evil people in the world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do I seek? Didn’t I cultivate so I could pursue the path of immortality so I could live as long as heaven and earth?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there was a heaven-shattering change in Zhao Jiuge’s heart. He straightened his heart and questioned himself to confirm his dao. She was but a woman, so arrogant to view him as a mere ant. Once he became strong, he would destroy that pride! At this moment, Zhao Jiuge remembered the name “Bo Re.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon boat floated above the pool and looked even darker in the night. Spirit force surged from the woman in pink and a ray of pink sword light appeared. It lit up the surrounding area like a small sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She casually waved the pink sword and a ray of light shot toward the pool. The light pierced the pool and caused ripples to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few seconds later, a thunderous bang came from the pool and the water shot hundreds of meters into the air. Even the cliffs around the pool shook. The two women silently watched the pool, but even after a long time, there was no movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plain-clothed woman still had an expression like an iceberg, but the woman in pink frowned. She condensed the pink sword once more and the pink light shined brightly. She picked up the sword and the spirit force in her body rushed into the pink sword in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a powerful wave, pink spirit force swept down and struck the pool like lightning. A series of explosions echoed, followed by a thunderous rumble. The surrounding cliffs began to crumble and rocks fell into the pool. Even the flow from the waterfall split.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second attack from the woman in pink was considerably stronger. Everything calmed down as if nothing had happened. For the first time, the expression of the plain-clothed woman changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She frowned slightly and there was a flash of light in her eyes. A layer of milky white spirit force appeared, and all of a sudden, a two-meter-long sword appeared in her right hand. The long sword’s body was purple and the entire sword shined. The purple light continued to shine and release a purple aura. The words “Purple Abyss” were carved on the handle of the sword</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the woman in pink looked at the purple flying sword, there was a flash of jealousy in her eyes that quickly turned to envy. Her expression became complicated as she thought that this person was indeed worthy of being called the daughter of heaven and their teacher’s direct disciple. She had even been given the Purple Abyss Sword for this trip outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the plain-clothed woman gathered her spirit force to act herself, there was finally a reaction from the pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water level of the pool continued to sink as a giant shadow broke out from the water. The sound of water flowing echoed, but the thing inside the pool had not appeared yet. The entire pool and the surrounding cliffs were covered in a powerful pressure as violent spirit force fluctuated. Zhao Jiuge, standing at the edge of the cliff, felt like someone was choking him. He almost couldn’t breathe and his body was trembling.</span></p>
