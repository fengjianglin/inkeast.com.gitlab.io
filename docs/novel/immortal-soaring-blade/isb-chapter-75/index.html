 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you have the ability, then you can find someone as beautiful as my family’s Qingqing to be happy in the mountains, but considering how you look, I fear you don’t have the ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Zhao Jiuge spoke, the expressions of the other three all changed, but they were all different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Zimo heard Zhao Jiuge’s words, his eyes narrowed, making him look as if he was calculating something. He stared at the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus in Zhao Jiuge’s right hand. With his family’s status, these herbs were not precious and the sect contributions were pointless to him. However, Bai Zimo was a very proud and vain person. He only wanted to find the seven herbs in order to show off among the new disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Qingqing heard Zhao Jiuge’s slightly flirty words, her face turned slightly red and she cursed at him in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When facing outsiders, I’ll give you some face, but if you call me ‘Qingqing’ so affectionately again, I’ll make your ears swell. This brat used to be so honest, but now his mouth is getting more and more mischievous. He was honest like a block of wood back on the stairs—how did he change so quickly? It's either ‘Big Sister Qingqing’ or ‘my family’s Qingqing,’ but when he is in a bad mood, he gives me the cold shoulder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the slender youth heard Zhao Jiuge’s sarcastic words, his face turned red and his chest began heaving up and down. His eyes were fierce as he stared at Zhao Jiuge as if he wanted to swallow him whole. “Your words are pretty good, but I wonder, is your cultivation as amazing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, obediently hand over the Seven-Leaf Green Jade and save your energy for the fight you will have the day after tomorrow. Looking at you, who only knows how to hide behind a woman, you are destined to be defeated by others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo had his arms crossed and proudly raised his chin. His face was filled with contempt and his words were extremely arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge frowned angrily and his face tightened. He was about to speak, but he didn’t expect Bai Qingqing to be even faster than him. Her words were even more arrogant than Bai Zimo’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with being a woman? You looking down upon a woman? This old lady is a woman! If you’re not convinced, then let's fight. What kind of world are we living in now that even some random clowns dare to jump out? You want the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus? Then come and see if you have the ability to take it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Bai Qingqing revealed a charming smile. She stretched out her white arms and gently hooked her fingers. “But now you have successfully angered this old lady, and this old lady has changed her mind. Seeing how tired you both are, you two must have been searching all night. I wonder, how was your harvest?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice was filled with ignorance, but just from Bai Qingqing’s words and movements, it would be impossible to know that the two sides were ready to face off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the two people on the other side, Bai Qingqing, who had long been dissatisfied, seemed to have found a place to vent and erupted like a little lioness. First, she was yelling arrogantly, then she suddenly turned graceful and charming. The three men here were completely dumbfounded. How come this woman changed her mood faster than flipping through a book?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge saw Bai Qingqing like this, how could he not know what she was planning to do? He knew that she was about to erupt—this was the calm before the storm. The anger brought on by the words from the slender youth had been diluted by Bai Qingqing’s actions, and Zhao Jiuge was holding back a smile. He sighed in his heart and thought that she was a little fox and that her sly nature was revealing itself again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing revealed a charming smile. Her blue sword robe outlined her graceful figure and revealed her white and tender neck. Her hair was lazily scattered over her shoulders and wasn’t coiled up. This gave off an unbounded feeling of grace, and her exquisite face had an alluring smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slender youth suddenly dulled and became short of breath, his slips trembling. Although he didn’t know why Bai Qingqing had asked about how many herbs they had harvested, he honestly answered, “We’ve found three herbs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he seemed to enter a trance as he stared at Bai Qingqing’s figure—he didn’t even blink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the slender youth’s reaction, Bai Qingqing smiled even more brilliantly. At the same time, she turned to look at Zhao Jiuge. She had a triumphant look on her face, and her eyes clearly said “Look, my charm is unstoppable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Zimo saw the ugly attitude of the slender youth, he looked at him with disgust. He cursed this idiot in his heart. The slender youth didn’t know why Bai Qingqing had asked the question, but Bai Zimo, who was more mature than his age, knew why. Bai Qingqing had the same thought as him—to steal the other party’s herbs. Just as he was about to awaken the slender youth, he felt a burst of spirit force. It was Bai Qingqing releasing her dazzling spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing was just smiling a second ago, but now, a second later, her expression had changed greatly. Her face was cold and the aura that had erupted from her body caused her black hair to sway over her shoulder without any wind. Under the shocking gazes of the slender boy and Bai Zimo, she made her move. Pink spirit force gathered before her chest. It was the most dull yet most effective method. The cluster of pink spirit force swept before the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Bai Qingqing’s sudden action, the slender youth was a bit confused. He had not reacted to Bai Qingqing’s sudden change in expression. This scene completely subverted Bai Qingqing’s alluring and charming figure in his heart. This was clearly a violent lioness! Only when Bai Zimo erupted with spirit force no weaker than Bai Qingqing’s did the slender youth recover. He immediately erupted his own spirit force without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom… Boom...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of two spirit forces erupting followed. Both of them were at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them were all the best among this group of disciples. It has to be said that those with weak cultivation were only at the Spirit Detecting Realm. When Bai Zimo and the slender youth erupted their spirit forces, Bai Qingqing’s attack had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pink spirit force floated over like a cloud and descended on them. Bai Zimo and the slender youth quickly released their own spirit forces into the forms of clouds too. A green cloud and a blue cloud collided with the pink cloud one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They collided with a bang, then an invisible ripple spread out. The flowers and grass on the ground were blown outwards and the branches of those towering trees shook, creating a rustling sound. The slender youth was shocked and he couldn help but take two steps back. When Bai Zimo felt the impact, he felt his body move back uncontrollably. At the moment he was being pushed back, Bai Zimo revealed a look of shock and then he forced his cultivation to the extreme. Only then were his left feet able to remain still, but his right foot still took one step back to stabilize himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Zimo’s expression became a bit ugly when he saw that Bai Qingqing was as stable as Mount Tai. She was casually standing there, looking at them with contempt. He hadn’t expected Bai Qingqing to be able to suppress them both. On his side, he had taken half a step back, while the slender youth had taken two whole steps back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a simple move, the winner and loser had been decided. Bai Zimo felt bitter and had to admit that his cultivation was not as powerful as hers. Before entering the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he thought he was going to be number one among the new disciples. He had enjoyed the best resources and treatment in his family. He was like the sun that dazzled in the family. He had reached the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm in his teens, and if not for wanting to join the sect, he could have used his family’s resources to choose a spirit vein to condense his foundation formation to enter the Foundation Realm. Instead, he had held off to erupt after joining a sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he hadn’t expected to be set back again and again. Not only was Mu Zijun better than him, there was also the unfathomable Bai Qingqing. Bai Qingqing was the one he couldn’t accept the most because she was a woman! How could the proud Bai Zimo accept this? Bai Zimo’s body was tense, but he didn’t make any movements. He dreaded the fickle woman on the other side. What’s more, there was still the somewhat mysterious Zhao Jiuge, who hadn’t made a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Zimo first saw the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus, he became a bit hot-headed. He had always looked down upon others and had become accustomed to it. When he saw Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing together, he didn’t think much of it—he thought they would be afraid and hand over the lotus due to his might. Even though Bai Qingqing had a stronger cultivation, since they were both at the Spirit Transformation Realm, she couldn’t be much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he know that Bai Qingqing was like a little fox? She had the figure of a devil, the face of an angle, and the heart of a witch. That hot temper really opened his eyes, and only now did he discover the gap from his perception. Now he found it difficult to get away from this tiger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Bai Zimo was Bai Zimo. After those thoughts flashed through his mind, his arrogant character revealed itself. Since he had already acted and could not withdraw, he might as well see this through to the end. He steeled his heart and a fierce gaze appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slender youth followed Bai Zimo. When he saw Bai Zimo doing nothing, he stood still as well. When he saw Bai Zimo’s aura erupt, he understood Bai Zimo’s intent and his body became tense, ready to move out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge, who had been paying attention to the two of them, had already been preparing. When he saw the fierce gazes in their eyes, he also made his move. The power of the spirit force he released was similar to the previous three. Then Zhao Jiuge formed a seal and fiercely shook his hand. A layer of golden light covered Zhao Jiuge’s body as if he was bathing in sunlight. It was the Sanskrit Divine Body. The moment he entered the battle, he used it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fierce aura faintly rushed toward Bai Zimo and the slender youth. The four of them faced off and their fierce auras collided. One side was arrogant and vigilant, while the other side was contemptuous. A big battle was about to erupt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When picking fruit, one must pick the soft ones first. Bai Zimo leaped into the air and pounced toward Zhao Jiuge like a leopard. Although he felt that Zhao Jiuge’s eruption at the stair was stunning and a bit mysterious, deep down in his heart, he felt contempt for Zhao Jiuge’s cultivation. A powerful foundation was not something everyone could have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he immediately rushed toward Zhao Jiuge the moment he moved. Filled with spirit force, Bai Zimo moved like lightning. When he moved, he immediately took the advantage. He didn’t use any spells like Zhao Jiuge, because he had his own pride. His pride wouldn’t let him use a spell against Zhao Jiuge, because he didn’t consider Zhao Jiuge to be on the same level as himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He waved his hand and reached toward his back. The wooden sword behind his blue sword robe appeared in his right hand. Spirit force was injected into the wooden sword, causing it to buzz. Bai Zimo’s eyes were firm as he locked on to Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slender youth copied Bai Zimo. He also took the wooden sword from his back, but the distance between him and Bai Zimo kept growing. When Bai Zimo completely erupted, he should not be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing their actions, Bai Qingqing’s gaze was filled with contempt and she sneered. She had her own pride. Just like how Bai Zimo looked down on Zhao Jiuge, she also didn’t consider them worthy. When she saw the two of them only take out the wooden sword and nothing else, Bai Qingqing’s slender arm also reached for her wooden sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were going to fight, then let it be fair. She didn’t take out her Wind Flower Sword, as not only would she feel disdain for using it, she also felt it was unnecessary. From the moment Bai Zimo entered the building, she had paid attention to him and understood that he was merely arrogant due to his family background. That kind of family background compared to hers was like comparing a creek to the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the eastern sea was where rogue cultivators gathered, some powers emerged there. However, the Huaxia Dynasty and the eastern sea didn’t interact much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flash of coldness appeared in Bai Qingqing’s eyes as she tilted her wooden word and sneered in her heart. “Today, we’ll see if you two have the ability to take the Seven-Leaf Green Jade Lotus or if this old lady will loot the three herbs you guys found last night!”</span></p>
