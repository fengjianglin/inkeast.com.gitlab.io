 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, during the group fight, everyone came to a tacit understanding to not use spirit force, because when people used spirit force, it would not result in simple injuries. If you weren’t careful, you could get seriously hurt and even come into mortal danger. However, at this moment, the youth with the dimples felt danger. He felt a pierce wind prickling his face, so he quickly released his spirit force to protect his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the spirit force appeared, Zhao Jiuge’s kick arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples swayed as he staggered back from the impact of the kick. Because he had used his spirit force, he wasn't injured. Zhao Jiuge’s kick was as fast as thunder and didn’t use any spirit force, but he was able to knock the youth back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples had been caught off guard and had subconsciously released spirit force to protect his body, but he was still knocked away by Zhao Jiuge’s kick. He was shocked at how much stronger Zhao Jiuge had become compared to one month ago. The power of this kick was obvious. After cultivating the Sanskrit Divine Body, his physical body had become more and more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivation was like going up against the river current. If you don’t advance, you’re regressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time slowly passes, some people neglect their cultivation either due to being lazy or playing around too much while other people work hard, so the gap only becomes bigger. When they stepped onto the stairs during the exam, they were very close in strength. After less than two months, there was an obvious gap between the two of them. Although they were both in the Spirit Transformation Realm, even within the same realm, there could be differences in strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Zhao Jiuge’s performance on the stone platform was amazing, many people disapproved. The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect focused mainly on the sword as its main method of fighting. Zhao Jiuge’s sword art was a bit better than average, but he had relied on that mysterious spell to win. This caused some people to feel unconvinced at the result. The youth with the dimples had experienced Zhao Jiuge’s kick, so he immediately understood that Zhao Jiuge hadn’t only relied on his spell, he also had a powerful cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sanskrit Heart Sutra was more peaceful than overbearing. As Zhao Jiuge completed cycles of the Sanskrit Heart Sutra, his spirit force was being slowly nourished, so even his spirit force was much stronger than that of others. In addition, the Moonlight Dew, the Spirit Tempering Pill, and the Sanskrit Divine Body had all nourished his body. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s physical body and quality of spirit force were top among this group of disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing in the mind of the youth with the dimples was to run. He was prepared, so he surged his spirit force and began to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was fast, Zhao Jiuge was even faster. Zhao Jiuge could activate the Sanskrit Divine Body at will. A layer of golden light dyed his body golden, then he moved so fast that he left afterimages. His right hand reached out like a hawk catching a rabbit. At the same time as his hand reached for the youth with the dimples, his vicious words echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you continue to run, I don’t mind using spirit force to break your leg. If you don’t believe me, you can try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice was chilly and the youth with the dimples felt a chill on his check. Hearing Zhao Jiuge’s tone, he knew Zhao Jiuge was not joking. And by now, how could he not understand that Zhao Jiuge was here due to today’s matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples dissipated his spirit force and trembled. His tone was a little nervous, and his face was extremely unnatural as he said, “You… What exactly do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do I want? You all beat my brother, what do you think I want?” After hearing the youth with the dimples’ question, Zhao Jiuge became impatient. He raised his brow and his answer was filled with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brother? The eyes of the youth with the dimples widened and he began to think. He had never heard about Zhao Jiuge having a brother among that group of disciples. However, seeing how angry Zhao Jiuge was, he didn’t think Zhao Jiuge was lying to him. In addition, there was no need to lie to him. The youth with the dimples was flustered and kept thinking about the faces of the group of bumpkins they beat up, but he couldn’t find anyone who looked like Zhao Jiuge. Then he suddenly seemed to think of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the youth with the dimples’ expression, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes were filled with a sense of toying with his enemy. He put on a fake smile and asked, “What, did you remember?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples indeed remembered. Today, that slightly evil-looking youth he had beaten never made a sound and refused to yield no matter how much he was hit. He remembered that youth lived in the same house as Zhao Jiuge. He thought that Zhao Jiuge was here because of that youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember, so what!?” The youth with the dimples nodded cautiously but then felt like it was too embarrassing, so he subconsciously straightened his back. He pretended to be stubborn and tough. and his tone became a bit aggressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp slapping sound echoed. Zhao Jiuge didn’t hesitate to swing his right hand. A trace of blood flowed out from the corner of the youth with the dimples’ mouth. After being hit, the youth with the dimples was in shock and looked like he was about to erupt. However, just at this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s cold words stopped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you dare to use spirit force, then I don’t mind using spirit force as well. However, at that point, I won’t be able to control myself. If you become seriously injured or disabled, don’t blame me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing the youth with the dimple obediently release his spirit force, Zhao Jiuge felt secretly relieved. This was because if they began fighting with spirit force for real and hurt each other, he would have broken the sect’s rules, which would be troublesome. Right now it didn’t matter, because the injuries from just fighting with the flesh was not a big deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge has been suffocating from anger and no longer cared about his image. He vigorously swung his arms and legs while he beat up the youth with the dimples. He specifically targeted the face. When he saw the youth with the dimples curled up on the ground, he felt like he saw himself being beaten up back in the mountain village. For a moment, he hesitated, but then he thought about Luo Xie’s bruised face and injuries. His eyes lit up and he no longer showed any mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples wrapped his hands around his head and curled up in the ground. No matter how much Zhao Jiuge beat him, he just clenched his teeth. However, his spiteful gaze, which was blocked by his arms, was locked onto Zhao Jiuge. And Zhao Jiuge, who was getting his revenge, didn’t notice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After beating him for a few minutes, Zhao Jiuge spat out a mouthful of foul air. He felt a bit happy. He suddenly faintly understood what the mentality of those people that got their revenge was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge stared coldly at the youth with the dimples and then spat out a few cold words. “Scram. Let’s see if you dare to randomly bully others again. If you do, I’ll beat you up every time I see you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth with the dimples didn’t say a word as he covered the painful parts of his body. He only silently turned to leave. However, when he turned, that spiteful gaze appeared once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the youth with the dimples slowly leave, Zhao Jiuge felt his fingers tremble. His heart was beating rapidly. He clearly knew that this was the first time he had bullied someone else. After Zhao Jiuge stepped onto the path of cultivation and his strength increased bit by bit, his mentality was also slowly changing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge understood a lot and why those disciples from the good families were so arrogant and looked down upon others. That was because it was self-confidence brought on by strength and their family status. Just like how he was able to easily beat the youth with the dimples. That was because his strength was outstanding among this group of disciples, so he dared to act like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One day, power will be in my hands. When that happens, I’ll kill everyone who has wronged me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle breeze blew by and Zhao Jiuge’s eye squinted while he looked at the rolling clouds around the mountains in the distance. An unprecedented aura emerged from his slender figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Somewhere in the Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a secret room, Instructor Zhou was sitting on a hemp-colored praying mat. There was a flower with three colors, black, white, and blue, printed on the praying mat. The secret room was not large, but it was clean and quiet. There was also a six-legged incense furnace with a strange animal carved on it here. There were three tan incense sticks burning in it. The incense exuded a light sandalwood fragrance that would help you calm down so you could better think and comprehend spells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the spirit force surging into the sky, Instructor Zhou suddenly opened his eyes. His brows were curved like a silkworm and his expression was serious. Although that fluctuation of spirit force had passed by in a flash, Instructor Zhou had still clearly felt it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell are those little fellows doing? They don’t want to properly cultivate, they just make messes everywhere. I felt like something was off today, but I didn’t take it to heart, yet you guys make it worse and worse each time. I want to see what the hell you all are doing,” Instructor Zhou muttered to himself before he closed his eyes. Then his divine sense spread out toward the Mysterious Heaven Peak. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge only knew the cultivation realms before the Nascent Soul Realm. Although there were more realms beyond Nascent Soul, Ye Wuyou was afraid that Zhao Jiuge would look too far ahead, so he didn’t tell Zhao Jiuge. If he saw Instructor Zhou with his divine sense spread out, Zhao Jiuge would definitely be surprised.</span></p>
