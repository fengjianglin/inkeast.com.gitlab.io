 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

They didn’t expect to make a mistake and encounter such powerful opponents right at the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was too late to regret it now, not to mention they still held the numbers advantage. No matter how powerful the other group was, they were only three people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth rushed ahead of everyone holding a slender, greyish-black flying sword. He used the sword energy from the Sword Energy Elucidation Chapter, which was the first chapter of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ray of silver sword energy appeared and flew toward Zhao Jiuge. What Zhao Jiuge said before had upset him and humiliated their Mysterious Fallen Peak. That was why he immediately attacked Zhao Jiuge and completely ignored Leng Rufeng and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the fierce honest-looking youth, Zhao Jiuge felt a sense of pride surge. Since the other party was using the sword art, he was going to use the sword art as well. Even if they didn’t use anything else, it would be enough to win!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the honest-looking youth was being so vicious, then Zhao Jiuge was not going to hold back. The Blue Plum Sword shined and spirit force surged into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first layer of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art appeared in Zhao Jiuge’s heart and then an even more brilliant ray of silver sword energy appeared at the tip of the Blue Plum sword. The silver light gave off a sharp aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sent this ray of sword energy toward the sword energy that was flying toward him. After he comprehended the first layer and used it to break through to the Foundation Realm, he hadn’t used it much. This was because he didn’t have a good flying sword nor the second layer of the sword art yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just because he hadn’t used it in a long time, that didn’t mean his sword art was worse than the honest-looking youth’s. The difference between realms was not something that could be bridged easily—his spirit force at the Foundation Realm was much more condensed and overbearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two rays of sword energy collided, resulting in a bright glow. Both of them could feel stinging pain on their skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a flash, the honest-looking youth’s ray of sword energy exploded and shattered, hitting the surrounding flowers and grass. The fragments instantly pierced the flowers and leaves, creating a series of explosions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth obviously had powerful practical experience, and everything had happened as he expected. When he sent out that attack, he protected his whole body with spirit force to resist what remained of Zhao Jiuge’s blow. He was ready to block the attack and issue a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had guessed the beginning but not the end. The aggressive ray of sword energy hit the spirit force he had used to shield himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth only felt a buzz in his mind and his body received a heavy blow. He was knocked away a few meters and the light disappeared. The bones in his body cried out in pain. The surrounding grass was forcibly cut by the residual sword energy and was knocked back along with the honest-looking youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth let out a groan and endured the pain. He supported himself with his right hand, but his face was distorted from the pain. He gritted his teeth and his eyes were ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t give him the opportunity to get up at all—he attacked with full force. What’s more, the other side had more people, so he had to make an example out of this one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden spirit force materialized around him and condensed into a giant, yellow palm that smashed toward the honest-looking youth. He remembered the words his senior brother had told him, that if he encountered a disciple of the other two peaks, beat them without worry, just don’t kill. That was why although Zhao Jiuge’s attacks looked mighty, he wasn’t using his full power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the golden palm hit the honest-looking youth, who could not react in time. The honest-looking youth’s sword robe shredded and his skin turned red like he was covered in blood. There were bloodstains on the corners of his mouth and he was in an extremely sorry state. His right arm that was supporting him was now flat on the ground and his fingers gently twitched a few times. He was completely motionless now. If not for his breathing, everyone would think he was dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Zhao Jiuge knew what had happened clearly. If this youth didn’t have Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation supporting his body, even with Zhao Jiuge holding back, it would have been difficult for him to escape death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of this happened in a flash. Only the four people in front had moved, while the remaining dozen-plus hadn’t managed to move. Yet the honest-looking youth was already beaten into the ground and covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the other two quickly finished their battles as well. After all, the difference between the Spirit Transformation Realm and the Foundation Realm was not just a bit of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the stuttering fatty was holding a huge, black flying sword. Its body exuded a dark glow and its width was almost ⅓ of a meter. It was equivalent to the width of five or six swords. However, although it looked powerful, it wasn’t worth much. Even though it was huge, it was made of ordinary black iron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stuttering fatty was very funny when he spoke, but when he entered combat, it was as if he changed to a different person. His temperament was much sharper than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used both hands to hold up the huge flying sword. The sword was tilted to lean against his right shoulder, and he charged forward toward Leng Rufeng. After all, making him attack Bai Qingqing was more difficult than anything else. Although he was running very fast, his pace was very stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng was different from Zhao Jiuge, who was disdainful and indifferent—his eyes were filled with battle intent. Even though the enemy was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm, this was his first time fighting someone using a flying sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could understand how happy ordinary disciples like them would be just to obtain even the lowest grade flying sword. However, even such a low grade weapon was very difficult to achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same move, the same sword art, and the same sword energy. The difference was that Leng Rufeng’s posture with the grey sword was somewhat awkward. This was, after all, his first time battling with it, so he was excited and nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was so busy thinking about the flying sword that he completely forgot to show mercy. He attacked without holding back, and his attack was like thunder. His hands rose into the air and the sword descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword energy flew out like a dragon toward the fatty, which startled the fatty, who liked to fight head-on. The shock was followed by a sense of discomfort, and when he felt the sting from the sword energy, he knew that this was different from the usual fights he had in the mountains—this was a real battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was too late for him to use any sword art, he could only release his spirit force like crazy to create a shield around his body. At the same time, his spirit force surged into his hands and into the huge, black flying sword. While defending, he wanted to use his brute force to help resist this powerful sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there was a flash of madness in the fatty’s eyes, but in the end, it was all in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword energy expanded in the fatty’s eyes and there was a flash of light in the fatty’s eyes. This was the time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly waved the huge, black flying sword in his hand, and that powerful swing swept toward Leng Rufeng’s ray of sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deafening roar echoed through the forest. Even the surrounding trees trembled, and leaves and branches fell off. If the surrounding trees made such a big movement, then there was no need to talk about the fatty, who was at the center of the collision. It has to be said that Leng Rufeng hadn’t held back like Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty coughed out a large mouthful of blood into the air and both his hands were cracked. The cracks were dyed red with blood like scars printed on his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the sleeves of his green sword robe were shredded and were barely hanging there. They had been cut by the sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty was sent flying into the air in a parabola and fell to the ground with a dull muffle. Dust was sent flying into the air along with the fallen leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the fatty was even more seriously injured than the honest-looking youth. When he fell to the ground, he didn’t even twitch. Although he looked fine on the outside, his internal organs were damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Bai Qingqing, her movements were much simpler and cleaner than those of the other two. The Wind Flower Sword in her hand shined and she didn’t use the sword art—she merely relied on her spirit force and struck the two Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their green sword robes immediately fell apart, revealing only the white underwear below. The long, black hair on their heads floated into the air and then fell to the ground like dead leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her moves were even more amazing than Zhao Jiuge and Leng Rufeng’s. She had full control over her spirit force. Although those two hadn’t suffered any harm, they were shocked greatly and there was now a shadow casted on their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two youths licked their slightly dried lips and looked at each other. They felt that Bai Qingqing’s spirit force had dissipated, but they didn’t dare to move. Their hands had turned green from clenching their flying swords. They stared at Bai Qingqing, waiting for her next action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them all moved very fast, and their fights had ended in the blink of an eye. This immediately caused the Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples that were going to rush forward to stop. They looked at the two that were seriously injured and the two that didn’t dare to move. They didn’t think that three Foundation Realm cultivators could do this much!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the shock they felt, the Mysterious Fallen Peak disciples didn’t speak. They hesitated, and they were looking at the expressions of their peers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their previously fierce expressions had completely disappeared. Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but smile and playfully say, “Now whose turn is it to quickly hand over their flags?”</span></p>
