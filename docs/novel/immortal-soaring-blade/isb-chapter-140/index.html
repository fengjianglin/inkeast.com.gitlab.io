 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Zhao Jiuge’s brows rose and he wondered who would come now. He quickly stopped cultivating and got out of his bed. He wondered if it was Luo Xie coming back when a figure entered the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person was beautiful, with long hair casually draped over her shoulder, wearing a water-blue skirt. With a delicate face and an alluring temperament, it was Bai Qingqing. When she saw Zhao Jiuge, she was startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then she began observing Zhao Jiuge and smiled. “Oh, we haven’t seen each other in a while, but your cultivation has increased a lot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the familiar, teasing tone, Zhao Jiuge’s heart felt warm and he smiled happily. He was a bit puzzled and asked, “How did you know I was here? I just returned today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing flicked the hair draping over her shoulder and said, “I've been feeling bored ever since I came out of the spirit vein, so I came to find you to play. However, I heard that you had gone out, so I’ve been coming over to check every three to five days. I just happened to come by today. I have been here many times already; otherwise, how else would I know you would be back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know what to do and scratched his head. He chuckled a few times before shifting the topic. “I heard that you stayed inside the spirit vein for half a month and was the first disciple to reach the Foundation Realm. Really powerful.” These words contained a hint of flattery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing felt very good. Feeling very proud, she smiled. “This is not like you, you even learned to flatter people. It seems having gone out for a bit has changed you a lot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Bai Qingqing spoke, Zhao Jiuge's expression changed and he had a cheeky smile on his face. He looked somewhat proud as he said, “That’s right, people always change. I just came out of the spirit vein. Do you know how long your big brother stayed inside the spirit vein? Almost a month, haha.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smile on Bai Qingqing’s face disappeared and her expression changed. She was very knowledgeable and understood what being able to stay in the spirit vein for almost a month meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt unprecedented happiness, as he felt that strength was the most important thing. “Let’s see if you still dare to rely on your strength to bully me and when you make me call you ‘big sister.’ Now I can finally reverse the situation and sing happily.” The more Zhao Jiuge spoke, the more happy he felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, are you happy about that? That you finally won’t be bullied by your big sister?” Bai Qingqing’s eyes narrowed and she raised her head. She smiled particularly brightly while looking at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt a bit proud at this point and nodded, smiling arrogantly. “That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he finished speaking, Zhao Jiuge felt intense pain in his heart. Bai Qingqing, who had been smiling particularly bright before, suddenly turned vicious. “You dare to act smug? Just because your cultivation increased a bit, you dare to show off before me? You think you can reverse the situation and sing? Then try and sing!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had one hand on her waist, while her other hand was viciously pulling Zhao Jiuge’s ear. She was grinding her teeth while she spoke and continued to pull his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ouch!” Zhao Jiuge suddenly exclaimed from the pain. Due to the pain, his face became somewhat distorted, but he angrily cried, “Bai Qingqing, don’t think that just because your cultivation level is higher, you can rely on your treasures and spells to always bully me. This time, my strength has increased greatly and I am no longer the same as before. Considering our friendship, I’m too lazy to teach you a lesson. Now, remove your hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh, I beg you to teach me a lesson. I’m going to see how you are going to teach me. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson without using a magical treasure. Come, don’t back down if you’re a man.” Bai Qingqing was as overbearing as ever. When she heard Zhao Jiuge’s words, she smiled angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly felt unconvinced. He had become a bit rash after making a few breakthroughs in a short period of time. He was confident that with his mid stage Foundation Realm cultivation, he had caught up to Bai Qingqing and could put up a fight. Although their friendship was deep, it didn’t mean he didn’t want to compete with her to see who was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then come.” After Zhao Jiuge spoke, his spirit force surged through his body and his Foundation Realm cultivation erupted. The pressure rushed toward Bai Qingqing. He was going to let her know that he wasn't stagnant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the mid stage Foundation Realm aura, Bai Qingqing’s eyes became serious for a moment before a faint smile appeared on her face. She felt a bit emotional. “This blockhead really does dare to fight. His strength has increased a lot, but did he really think he could act all high and mighty before me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force erupted, an even more powerful spirit force erupted. It was obvious which one was stronger. The pressure around Bai Qingqing disappeared and now Zhao Jiuge was about to be surrounded instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The late stage of the Foundation Realm! How could he know that Bai Qingqing had made two consecutive breakthroughs at the spirit vein? Zhao Jiuge wasn’t the only one who could use the spirit vein to increase his cultivation level, everyone had the same chance. It all depended on how much your body could handle. Bai Qingqing had been taking spirit pills ever since she was young and therefore had a good physique. In addition, with her talent, her cultivation soared. Zhao Jiuge only had average talent, so the increase in his cultivation level was less, but his physique had taken a qualitative leap forward. These were all things that Zhao Jiuge didn’t know about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression changed a few times. It was a wonderful sight. Previously, he thought that because he had reached the mid stage of the Foundation Realm after tempering his body in the spirit vein, he had caught up to Bai Qingqing. He didn’t know that in the past few months, Bai Qingqing’s cultivation had increased even more rapidly. This suddenly made Zhao Jiuge lose his desire to fight. Although they were in the same realm and someone at the early stage could beat someone at the late stage, that required spells, treasures, and other things to cover the gap. Zhao Jiuge knew in his heart that his experience in cultivation, combat, and worldly knowledge couldn’t compare with Bai Qingqing. Thinking about this, Zhao Jiuge revealed a bitter smile. His expression changed faster than flipping through a book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… Let’s forget about it. If we fought here, it would destroy the house.” Zhao Jiuge chuckled twice and then withdrew his spirit force. The surging spirit force disappeared and everything became calm once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain in his ear immediately reappeared once more. Bai Qingqing had a smile that wasn’t a smile. “Oh, were you confident that you could beat me after tempering your body in the spirit vein? What made you so confident? Didn’t you say that you were going to reverse the situation and sing?” She twisted her hand with more force and Zhao Jiuge’s mouth twisted in pain, but he didn’t dare to refute her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are something!” Zhao Jigue endured the pain and rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you say?” Bai Qingqing dragged her words and continued to apply force through her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intense pain from Zhao Jiuge’s ear made him feel helpless. He dejectedly said, “I said I was wrong, Big Sister Qingqing. Please let go, it hurts, it hurts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s dejected expression, Bai Qingqing laughed in her heart. She let go of his ear and said, “That’s more like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the pain ease, Zhao Jiuge muttered under his breath, “Everyone says that a reunion after an absence is sweeter than being newlyweds. Yet you actually went all out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing started at him with her hands on her hips. She viciously said, “What did you say? Are you asking for a beating again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge immediately shut up and no longer dared to continue to mutter. He quickly covered his ears. Seeing this, Bai Qingqing, who had been putting up a frown on purpose, could not hold it any longer and laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge helplessly looked at Bai Qingqing and laughed at him. He was unwilling, but he didn’t dare to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge backing down, Bai Qingqing was too lazy to pursue it further. She had been tense this whole time from cultivation, and messing around with Zhao Jiuge had allowed her to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was still silently sulking, Bai Qingqing, who was in a good mood, looked at Zhao Jiuge and said, “Cultivating all day is so boring. How about we go out and take a mission together? Aren’t you in need of sect contributions? Seeing how obedient you are, Big Sister here will give you her sect contributions to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was not in need of magical treasures and spells, Zhao Jiuge understood this. He was not going to act all sentimental with her—some things only needed to be remembered in his heart. He knew that this was Bai Qingqing’s way of secretly helping him. Although he always seems to suffer under her, he deeply cherished this friendship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was not going to make a fuss about Bai Qingqing taking advantage of him verbally, so he cheerfully agreed. “Okay, I was going to cultivate for a few more days to recover before taking on more missions. Since we are going together, let’s go now. I can cultivate while we rest on the journey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing gently nodded and playfully turned around. Zhao Jiuge quickly followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the yard, there was a flash of green light and her Wind Flower Sword appeared before her. She gently leaped on it, and her spirit force firmly wrapped around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked down at Zhao Jiuge and asked, “Do you know how to blade soar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge rolled his eyes and said, “Although my sword is not as good as yours, I can still blade soar.” He was unwilling to fall behind. After taking out the Blue Plum Sword, he also stepped on his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time he saw someone else’s high-grade flying sword, Zhao Jiuge felt his heart burn with passion, passion for more sect contributions. Now that his cultivation was stronger than before, he should be able to receive more difficult tasks, which should give more sect contributions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the two of them flew toward the Duty Hall. Zhao Jiuge’s control of his flying sword had become a lot better. Although he still couldn’t fly for long, his spirit force had increased. Since he was now at the mid stage of the Foundation Realm, he was barely able to keep up with Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two rays of light pierced the clouds and flew across the mountain peaks. The two of them flew side by side. Both were wearing blue robes, and both their robes fluttered in the wind. From far away, they somewhat looked like an immortal couple.</span></p>
