 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief moment of rest, Zhao Jiuge felt better. He endured the pain as he supported himself up from the ground. The little monkey jumped onto Zhao Jiuge’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little monkey screeched nonstop and waved its two little hands around. Zhao Jiuge stared at the little monkey dumbfoundedly, not understanding. When the little monkey saw that Zhao Jiuge didn’t move, it began to frantically wave its hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It then jumped off Zhao Jiuge and pulled his clothes. Zhao Jiuge finally understood what the little monkey wanted and walked toward the body of the adult monkey. The brown bear and adult monkey painted a tragic scene. One’s head was smashed and the other’s innards were pulled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world of cultivation was truly a world of the strong preying on the weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He buried the little monkey’s mother in the valley and then dug out the core of the brown bear. Being at the Spirit Transformation Realm meant that it had entered the threshold of being considered a spirit beast. Shortly after he finished, he was pulled by the little monkey, which jumped around as it led Zhao Jiuge to a cave. This was where the little monkey used to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Growing up in the village, the only warmth he felt was when he called his grandpa, but now it was gone. However, looking at the lively, little monkey, Zhao Jigue felt the emotion that was friendship for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little monkey’s fur wasn't fully grown yet and was a blackish brown. Zhao Jiuge shouted, “Little Black, you play by yourself for now, I have to recover from my injuries.” Little Black looked like he understood but didn’t understand at the same time. His small hands scratch his own head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat down and began to cycle the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit Heart Sutra to slowly recover his body. Then he took out the core he had dug out from the brown bear and ate it. There was no reaction at first, but soon a wave of heat came from his body. The heat wave shot from his dantian to his abdomen, heart, throat, and head, making his whole body feel hot. The Sanskrit Heart Sutra slowly moved the heat wave back into his dantian, then he gradually felt a cool sensation washing over his body. Zhao Jiuge had underestimated the amount of spiritual force in a beast at the Spirit Transformation Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two cracking sounds softly echoed from his body. It was as if his blood had reached a boiling point, and the cracking sound came from his blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As every drop of his blood cracked, the spirit force from the bear’s core surged into his body. Shortly after, a heat wave even stronger than before spread throughout his body, making him feel like his entire body was on fire. Zhao Jiuge’s face was covered in sweat and his eyes were filled with pain as he clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge endured the intense pain, but he was secretly excited that he had entered the Blood Movement Realm! He never would’ve expected today’s disaster to be a blessing in disguise. As his injuries recovered, the spirit force rushed into his body. This allowed him to reach the Blood Movement Realm he had tried to enter for several days with no luck. His blood continued to crackle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the spiritual energy was consumed, the sound of his boiling blood slowly disappeared and his blood now contained a layer of golden light. Zhao Jiuge knew he had entered the early stage of the Blood Movement Realm, and when his blood was filled with spirit force, he would have reached the peak of the Blood Movement Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he exited his cultivation state, he found that there was a layer of black impurities on his body like foul mud. After entering the Blood Movement Realm, as his spirit force flowed through his body, the impurities in his body would be forced out. It was the first step to changing his body completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he stood up and moved his body, crisp sounds came from his limbs. His body was filled with strength and his pores absorbed the spiritual energy around him. Even his vision seems to have broadened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After cleaning his body, he saw that Little Black had brought back some fruits from somewhere. He ate the fruits and played with Little Black for a bit. Looking at the smooth and comfortable cave and the lively Little Black, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but feel that life was full of joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he had entered the Blood Movement Realm, his body would be covered in a layer of foul impurities after he cultivated. Not even Little Black would want to be close to him at those moments. Zhao Jiuge spent every day solidifying his foundation and accompanying Little Black. He intended to wait a few days for his cultivation to stabilize before he began practicing the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit Divine Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several days, he felt like his cultivation had stabilized and his eyes were burning with passion. He was going to attempt to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He carefully studied the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanskrit Divine Body his teacher had left him and realized that the blurry image he had seen was a quote. Use the body as the guide, guide the spirit into the body, Sanskrit law appears, forever immortal, not dirty and not clean, doesn’t increase or decrease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was the image of a smiling buddha floating below this quote. It was surrounded by a circle of jewels with the hot sun hanging above. The jewels seemed to be gathering all the sunlight onto the smiling buddha. There was doubt in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes, and his brows furrowed. The record indicated that there were nine levels of the Sanskrit Divine Body and that at the highest level, one could summon the image of eight golden dragons. This was the sign of the eight golden dragons of the Sanskrit Divine Body, and it would make one’s body indestructible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if a bucket of cold water was poured on his head—his good mood of cultivating this technique disappeared. He had no idea where to start and decided to continue to cultivate to increase his cultivation level first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Little Black accompanying him, his days became more fulfilling. Today, he ended his cultivation early and unexpectedly found Little Black also absorbing spiritual energy beside him. This shocked Zhao Jiuge. Humans had to come up with different methods to absorb the spiritual energy in the world, while beasts simply relied on their instincts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force inside his body was becoming stronger and stronger, and less and less impurities were expelled through his skin after each cultivation session. After cultivating, he would play with Little black inside the valley. It was fortunate that the valley was filled with dense spiritual energy. All the colorful flowers and vegetation gently swayed in the world and a fragrance filled the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Black, run a bit slower,” the youth shouted as he chased after the little monkey. Little Black was running in front, but he would stop from time to time to look back at the youth. He would then scratch his head and return to the youth’s shoulder. His face was filled with mischief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kee… kee,” Little Black screeched as he waved his little hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Black what do you want to do?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kee...Kee.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Black, what do you think the outside world is like?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kee...Kee.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When do you think I’ll be able to successfully cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body? Once I succeed, I’ll have to leave.” No matter what Zhao Jiuge said, the little monkey only screeched back. The two of them were like a chicken and duck trying to talk. The sound of their strange conversation echoed through the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At night, he returned to the cave, and after completing two cycles, Zhao Jiuge suddenly heard a sound. He opened his eyes to see Little Black rolling around the cave. Powerful waves of spiritual energy were coming from Little Black, and his face was filled with pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What random spirit grass or fruit did Little Black eat now!? Little Black, quickly, cycle the spiritual energy through your body!” Zhao Jiuge cried anxiously. After hearing this, Little Black sat up and began to cultivate. The dense spiritual energy was quickly converted to Little Black’s own spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge watched Little Black cultivate. At first, Little Black’s breathing was subtle, but it slowly became frequent until the sound echoed like thunder in Zhao Jiuge’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand, I understand. Haha, I understand how to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body!” Zhao Jiuge cheerfully shouted. He had always thought that cultivation methods and cultivating techniques were the same working from the inside out. After seeing Little Black, he realized that he was mistaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Use the body as the guide, guide the spirit into the body. This meant he had to use his own body as a guide. No wonder he had to reach the Blood Movement Realm to cultivate this. After reaching the Blood Movement Realm, his pores would absorb spiritual energy on their own. He had to draw spiritual energy into his body to cultivate this and then, once it reached a certain amount, he would supplement it with his own spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat down and his hands formed the unfamiliar hand signs. He sensed the spiritual energy being absorbed through his pores, scattering through his blood. Zhao Jiuge tried to gather it, but after a few seconds, it all scattered once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is going on? Is the early stage of the Blood Movement Realm not enough?”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He frowned and decided that he would allow spiritual force to fill his blood and reach the mid stage of the Blood Movement before he tried to cultivate the Sanskrit Divine Body again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Little Black cultivated, the excess spiritual energy turned into Little Black’s own spirit force, so it was no longer painful. Little Black’s expression gradually became calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Little Black completely absorbed the last bit of spiritual energy, Zhao Jiuge scolded him with a frown, “I told you not to go into the mountains and eat random spirit grasses and fruits. Now that you know how bad it feels, I want to see if you dare to eat any more.” Little Black’s head was hanging low and he was filled with shame. His own little hands clasped at Zhao Jiuge, making for a very funny sight. Zhao Jiuge looked at Little Black and couldn’t help but be angry and find it funny at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been many days since we last left the valley. Tomorrow, I’ll take you out of the valley to look around and see if we can find any spirit fruits. Cultivating by absorbing spiritual energy is too slow.” Zhao Jiuge thought about how once he reached the late stage of the Blood Movement, he would be able to refine a golden dragon from the Sanskrit Divine Body. This thought made him become heated with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Black’s pitiful expression suddenly disappeared and he jumped on the youth’s shoulder. He intimately rubbed his face on the youth’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth never had any friends and had always been introverted. After spending some time with the lively Little Black, even his personality had become more cheerful.</span></p>
