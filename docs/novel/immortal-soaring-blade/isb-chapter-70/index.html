 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The miserable cry came from a distance at first and then closed in, becoming more clear. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were completely awake. After a few breaths, Zhao Jiuge felt spirit force fluctuations. With his Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation, he could vaguely feel something approaching but did not know what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He worked the Sanskrit Divine Body to the extreme, and the thin layer of golden light shined brightly. At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s brows were slightly wrinkled and he gave off a slightly imposing aura. He held his breath and waited for the arrival of the unknown. The Sanskrit Heart Sutra was also working rapidly, sending spirit force across every pore on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s little face was startled for a moment as the scream was a bit shocking. She was only in a trance for a moment before she snapped out of it. After all, she was already at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm. If not for the fact that she wanted to build a solid foundation, she could have already reached the Foundation Realm. Now she was only accumulating spirit force and waiting for a chance to make a breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the difference in cultivation levels appeared. Although they were in the same realm, Bai Qingqing clearly felt the pressure from the spirit force, but it wasn’t too strong. It should be around the Foundation Realm, making Bai Qingqing feel relieved. Her nervousness eased and there was some excitement in her beautiful eyes, along with strong battle intent. When Zhao Jiuge saw this, he was tongue-tied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought that this minx was truly strange—her personality changed faster than flipping a book. She was as calm as water before, but now was filled with battle intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unbeknownst to Zhao Jiuge, Bai Qingqing had always had a group of people following her. With them around, when would she ever have the chance to fight personally? Now that she was far from home, she was itching to use her full power. She felt that the enemy’s cultivation was not much stronger than hers, which would give a chance for her to show off her strength. At this moment, Bai Qingqing returned to her alluring temperament from before and was like a female warrior incarnate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rapid footsteps on the fallen leaves created a sound, and after Zhao Jiuge heard this sound, he felt that something was wrong. The sharp wind sounded like an arrow in flight, and before the figure even arrived, he could smell blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So fast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He waved his hand and took out the talisman that was glowing yellow. It was the signal talisman to call for help. It only required a bit of spirit force to activate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing was already filled with battle intent when she saw Zhao Jiuge pull out the talisman. How could she give up so quickly? It was not her style! She anxiously shouted for Zhao Jiuge to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing’s roar caused Zhao Jiuge to change his mind. At this moment, the two finally saw the appearance of the enemy. It was a spirit beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was tall and mighty, even half a body taller than Zhao Jiuge. The fur on its body looked like sharp iron, and a pair of bloodthirsty eyes stared at them. Its nose sniffed, and they could see scraps of food left between its teeth. The smell of blood came from its mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a wolf, a Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the size of the wolf, Zhao Jiuge was stunned. When he saw Little Black’s mother and the black bear, they were only around his height. Although they were only at the Spirit Transformation Realm, the fierce battle was still fresh in his memory. Seeing the size of this fellow and feeling the spirit force pressure, he didn’t even have to think to know that this was going to be trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt lucky that he had encountered the White Dew Frost, but danger was waiting for him afterwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf stared at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. His sharp claws grinded on the ground in front of it. It was as if it would launch its attack like a storm if the two made even the slightest movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge held his breath in fear that breathing too loudly would cause a misunderstanding with that big fellow. He was holding the talisman so tightly in his hand, even the joints of his fingers turned white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You hold off this fellow for a bit so I can release the talisman, then I’ll come to help deal with it. I believe it won’t be long for the instructors to arrive. If you agree, blink.” Zhao Jiuge didn’t turn around but continued to stare at the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf. He just glanced at Bai Qingqing as he muttered those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing was already impatient from the smell of blood coming at her face, and she had an expression of disgust. After hearing Zhao Jiuge’s words, she immediately yelled, “You successfully angered this lady. It’s not your fault for being ugly. However, it is your fault for coming here in the middle of the night to scare me. If I don’t deal with you today, my anger won’t be appeased!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice was so loud—it was as if she was afraid the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf couldn’t hear her. She was gnashing her teeth as if she had great hatred toward this fellow. However, Zhao Jiuge was frightened by Bai Qingqing’s actions and felt like his heart had missed a beat. Hearing her tone, Zhao Jiuge felt that it was absurd that she wanted to deal with this Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf that was twice her size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force coming from the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf indicated that it was at least at the Foundation Realm. After Zhao Jiuge entered the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, he learned that one would undergo an earth-shattering change upon entering the Foundation Realm. It was a qualitative leap as one began to become detached from the body. Also, a spirit beast could rely on its powerful body to be a bit stronger than humans at the same cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was a bit timid before he even started, because he had no experience, so he mistakenly thought the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was terrifying. It was a difference in mindset between the two created by the different environments they had grown up in. Since childhood, Bai Qingqing was used to seeing all kinds of powerful people because of her family background. She also knew a lot more, so she didn’t have the same mentality as Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the one hand, she wanted to test her strength. On the other, it was purely her spoiled personality at play—she just really disliked this wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no magnificent prelude or grand speech. Bai Qingqing simply moved, while Zhao Jiuge was still dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She leaped into the air and spun, then pink smoke whirled with her body. A faint fragrance followed, dispelling the bloody smell brought by the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf. When Bai Qingqing landed, a mass of pink spirit force shot toward the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf. She chose to send a probing attacking as her first move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the two humans before it moving, and one of them even attacking it, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf roared in anger. It originally smelled the auras of two humans and followed them here. When it felt that they weren’t that strong, it began having ideas. However, the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf didn’t expect that they would dare to provoke its might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wolf let out an angry roar at the sky and then closed its bloody mouth. All the hair on its body stood up and its eyes were like cold needles. The pink spirit force closed in and was about to hit its body. The large Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf was very agile, and just as the attack was about to land, it smashed its right claw toward it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The claw was like a weapon given to the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf by the heavens. The pink spirit force was destroyed with an easy slap, and after that, the wolf lunged forward with a kick of its back legs. Its huge body pounced toward Bai Qingqing, intending to tear apart its prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort and her eyes became cold. When she shot that pink spirit force, she had started gathering the sword energy she had learned yesterday. When the pink spirit force was destroyed by the wolf, she had already created a ray sword energy as thick as an arm. The ray of sword energy shot out from Bai Qingqing’s tender hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf had just jumped, so it had no control over its center of gravity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt melancholy when he saw the sword energy Bai Qingqing had condensed. Constantly comparing oneself to another would only make one angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before he could finish being melancholy, a shocking change took place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, who was flying through the air, saw the sword energy, its bloodthirsty eyes revealed a look of disdain. The wolf raised its front claws and smashed down on the sword energy. The sword energy dissipated, and its claws were unscathed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Qingqing let out a muffled groan and was forced back a few steps because she was caught off guard. The shortcomings of having no actual combat experience were immediately exposed. At a moment of crisis, she was actually stunned for a moment as she watched the sharp claws of the wolf fly toward her. As the sharp claws closed in on Bai Qingqing’s body, Zhao Jiuge, who had been watching this whole time, finally moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that not even Bai Qingqing’s sword energy could hurt the wolf a bit, there was no way he could do anything in a hurry. His finger-thick sword energy could only cut flowers and grass. He rapidly consumed his spirit force and the Sanskrit Divine Body aura around him shined unusually bright. Then Zhao Jiuge jumped in front of Bai Qingqing to protect her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his expression was grave and he shouted, “Quickly, use the talisman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was betting that the Sanskrit Divine Body would block the attack from the Ghost Wind Spirit Wolf, and he really had no better choice in this desperate situation.</span></p>
