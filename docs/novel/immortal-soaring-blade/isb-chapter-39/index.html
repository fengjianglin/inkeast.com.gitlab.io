<div id="announcement-body-119486" class="fr-view panel-body hidden"> 
 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark clouds gradually dissipated and the silver moon gradually revealed itself. As the spirit light around Su Su became more dense, there was a visible ripple in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The milky-white sword light became so dazzling, it was like the rising sun coming out of the ground, and enhanced the silver moon in the sky. The light from both lightened up the gloomy and bloody atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, whose mind was injured, no longer had a proud expression as he watched Su Su’s aura increase. He felt a sense of danger in his heart and no longer dared to look down upon this junior. He revealed a struggling expression before he spat a mouthful of essence blood onto the Spirit Devouring Zombie. Afterward, his face became even paler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Devouring Zombie sniffed the spirit blood before it greedily devoured it. A trace of emotion appeared in its eyes and the scar it had gotten from Su Su’s attack gradually recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man fed the Spirit Devouring Zombie his essence blood every day, so his mind had fused with the Spirit Devouring Zombie. At this critical moment, he could no longer care about his body; he only hoped to quickly deal with these two juniors. The fluctuations from Su Su had reached the point of endangering him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crisp sounds of the Soul Summon Bell echoed once more, and the invisible fluctuations made one feel vertigo and pain. When the old man saw the spirit light before Su Su become bright and brighter, he began to feel a sense of uneasiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Devouring Zombie let out a sharp scream and its eyes were no longer lifeless. Instead, it was filled with ferociousness and bloodthirst. Its long claws stretched out as it moved like the wind and its heavy footsteps trampled the ground, leaving deep footprints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s spirit force rapidly depleted and the formation in her dantian frantically absorbed spiritual energy to replenish her spirit force. The rate of consumption was faster than she could replenish and she was unable to keep up. As her spirit force began to falter, the zombie pounced. Su Su didn’t hesitate to ruthlessly use the brilliant sword light to destroy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no heaven-shattering sound or a dazzling light. It was so quiet that it was very strange. The long, sharp claws of the zombie were less than a meter away—so close that Su Su could feel their sharpness and coldness. Her body maintained the posture she had before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The milky-white sword struck the zombie, but it didn’t react. However, its metal-like skin was cut open like tofu. The milky white sword light disappeared like melting snow after colliding with the zombie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of foul-smelling odor spread out. When the Devouring Spirit Zombie’s upper body was cut open by Su Su’s spirit force, its internal organs spilled out. The zombie suddenly fell down. The Spirit Devouring Zombie the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder had spent so much painstaking effort to refine was destroyed by Su Su like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Su wasn’t doing much better. Her face was pale now. This long period of spirit force exertion had caused her body to be in a weakened state. Her body even showed signs of her spirit force drying up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was connected to the zombie by divine sense, and now that it was destroyed, the old man was seriously affected. First his son was killed, then the Nine Sons Mother Banner was destroyed, and finally the Spirit Devouring Zombie he had painstakingly refined was destroyed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, his body was injured and he could no longer withstand this blow. He coughed out a few mouthfuls of blood and coughed violently. He could no longer focus and remain in the air. The old man fell to the ground and stared at Su Su with a hateful gaze. His eyes were like poisonous snakes, making Su Su shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He endured the grief in his heart and surged the spirit force inside his body, ignoring his injuries. His eyes were filled with killing intent and ferocity. His blood-red spirit force was like a sea of blood that raged in the sky before quickly rushing toward Su Su. It was like a net that was about to wrap around her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su, who was completely exhausted, couldn’t have expected the withered old man to be capable of launching such a violent attack at this point, and her face suddenly lost all color. She could only watch as she used what little spirit force she had left to protect herself. The sea of blood smashed down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thunderous bang echoed and the blood-colored light that covered the sky instantly drowned Su Su’s small figure. Where Su Su stood was now a giant pit with dirt splashing everywhere. Su Su was lying on the slope of the pit. Thanks to the Purple Jade Glass Shuttle’s protection, there were no scars on her body, but her internal organs were seriously injured and her meridians were damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was unconscious, her eyes were closed, and she had a painful expression. Her brows gently wrinkled a few times. Seeing that his blow had finally caused Su Su to fall, the old man revealed a &nbsp;cruel smile and laughed. Because of this, his internal organs shook and he coughed violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su’s face was filled with pain as she lay there in a miserable state. The old man, who was completely exhausted, had a gloomy expression. Zhao Jiuge’s eyes turned red when he saw this, and his expression became fierce. He let out a roar and rushed forward like a meteor. Spirit force surged inside in his body and a pale yellow spirit light appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man, too exhausted to even move, watched Zhao Jiuge, who was filled with a powerful killing intent, charge toward him. However, there was no trace of panic or fear on his face, only a faint smile. That smile even contained a hint of relief. His hands were stained with the blood of countless innocents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was also a hint of indifference in his smile. Perhaps when his most beloved son died, his heart had also died. He had spent all his own effort on his son, and without his son, what joy was there in life? Now that most of his magic treasures were destroyed and even his Spirit Devouring Zombie was gone, he felt no anger or rage as he faced his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He simply blandly accepted the reality before him because he was the Ten Thousand Corpse Elder, the one who had dominated the region for decades. Even when facing his death, he had to be standing. Even though he was a villain, his dignity wouldn’t allow him to show his ugly side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The faint, yellow light in Zhao Jiuge’s hands smashed into the old man’s wrinkled face. The old man’s head fell after the neck broke with a crisp sound. The body remained standing for a few seconds before it powerlessly fell over. After confirming that this godforsaken old man was dead, Zhao Jiuge quickly rushed to the pit where Su Su was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Su, Su Su.” He held the pitiful Su Su in his arms. He began to shout anxiously and shook Su Su’s body. However, Su Su’s eyes remained closed, her face was pale, and she had a painful expression. Zhao Jiuge panicked and his heart beat rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to feeling so anxious, his red eyes teared up and became swollen. He was in a daze for a while and felt helpless when he suddenly remembered the three Blue Spirit Pills Mo Longjie had given him. He had used one to cultivate and still had two left in the jade bottle. Thinking of this, Zhao Jiuge quickly took out the jade bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a sigh of relief when he opened the bottle. He took out a Blue Spirit Pill, and the fragrance of the pill spread out. Zhao Jiuge took a deep breath and felt much better. He had intended to keep these two for when he attempted to reach the Foundation Realm and to help form his second golden dragon. However, at this moment, he was worried about Su Su and didn’t care about these matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clenched his teeth. Although there was reluctance in his eyes, he still put the Blue Spirit Pill in Su Su’s mouth. The pill entered her mouth, but because she was in a coma, it remained there. Zhao Jiuge frowned when he saw this, then he struggled before his lips met Su Su’s cherry lips. His heartbeat rapidly increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stuck out his tongue and pried Su Su’s teeth open. The Blue Spirit Pill turned to liquid and flowed down Su Su’s throat. Her body’s fragrance stimulated Zhao Jiuge’s nose, and along with the pill, he also tasted the dry sweetness of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He realized what he was doing and suddenly raised his head, leaving his indecent position with a blush. His chest heaved as he had held his breath during the kiss. He felt his own hot face and let out an inexplicable giggle upon thinking about how this was the first time he had been so intimate with a girl. However, when he saw Su Su lying there, injured, the smile on his face disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for a while, Zhao Jiuge estimated that the pill had taken effect, so he began to gently shake Su Su. His gaze was gentle as he said in a soft tone, “Su Su, Su Su, Su Su, you need to wake up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge secretly felt disappointed and thought that her injuries were too serious for the Blue Spirit Pill to have any effect on Su Su when a playful voice echoed in his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you shaking me for? I haven’t died yet. If you keep shaking me, I might as well die!” The voice was weak but was still as playful as before. Su Su had opened her eyes, and her bright eyes looked at Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was filled with worry. When he heard Su Su’s voice, his expression suddenly changed and he excitedly asked, “Su Su, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Su lied in Zhao Jiuge’s arms and gently shook her head. Then, as if she found something strange, she laughed. “Look at your red eyes, they look wet too. It can’t be that a big man like you cried, hahaha.” The corner of her mouth curved up into a pale smile as she teased Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
