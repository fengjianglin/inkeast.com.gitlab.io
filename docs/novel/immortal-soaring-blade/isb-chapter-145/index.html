 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t rush forward, this place is the edge of Yellow Flower Ridge’s influence. It's best to hide our spirit force now so we won’t be discovered. We will adjust our states now and then tomorrow we will only show Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation. Presumably, Han Songcheng will directly come to find us. After all, according to the intelligence, he has done many evil things including rape, killing, and stealing.” Now that they were within range of Yellow Flower Ridge, even Bai Qingqing’s expression became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge nodded and then looked at his surroundings. The rolling mountains and forests were covered in endless greenery. Below the mountain was a small area of flat land. Right now it was sunset, and the sun dyed the green earth with a layer of orange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge suddenly squinted and revealed a surprised expression because he saw smoke coming from the foot of the mountain in the distance. There was actually a village in such a remote mountain! Bai Qingqing looked toward where Zhao Jiuge was starting and she was startled as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhao Jiuge saw the village, he said, “Let’s go, we don’t have to spend the night in the wilderness today. We can stay at the village and ask about Han Songcheng’s situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing didn’t have any reason to reject this, so the two walked toward the village. In order to not scare away the person they were hunting, they didn’t blade soar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Bai Qingqing was going to follow Zhao Jiuge down the mountain, she suddenly looked back into the forest a few hundred meters away. Her eyes shined, but after she turned her head, she saw that there was nothing in the forest. She couldn’t help but feel some doubt. Just now, she felt like someone was watching her, but she couldn’t find anything. She couldn’t figure it out, so she suppressed the doubt in her heart. She followed Zhao Jiuge and the two of them walked down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after the two of them had been gone for an incense stick of time, there was movement in the forest where Bai Qingqing was staring. There were sounds of leaves rustling, and a thrifty-looking, skinny man emerged. He happily looked at the direction in which Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing had gone. He let out a vulgar laugh and glanced at the village ahead. He no longer hesitated and quickly ran off with a happy smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smoke in the distance looked close, but even for two Foundation Realm cultivators, it took them almost one hour to finally see the village before them. A few hundred meters away was a village that wasn’t small but not very big built into the foot of the mountain. The water flowing down from the mountain formed a stream that flowed through the edge of the village and around it. The village entrance had some wooden fences surrounding it, leaving only an entrance about a few meters wide. The small stream flowed directly in front of the village entrance, so there was a small bridge above the stream that led directly to the entrance of the village. The mountain on the backside of the village contained layers of farmland. There were a few cattle loitering around the field, leisurely shaking their tails and stomping their legs. There were a few women beside the stream at the entrance of the village, borrowing the light from the setting sun to wash clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this scene, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but envy life in the mountains. Although it was not as prosperous as the towns, it had its own unique flavor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really envy these villagers' leisurely days. There is no lying or cheating, and they don’t have to be so tired every day. They live carefree every day from sunrise to sunset, following a steady rhythm.” Zhao Jiuge sighed in his heart. Perhaps if he hadn’t accidentally encountered Yu Wuyou’s inheritance, he would also have lived this kind of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had no thought about this. “What is good about it? You would turn to dust after a mere 100 years. Repeat the same life day after day, year after year. No passion, no spirit of striving, boring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the two were talking, they had already walked down the mountain and arrived at the small bridge. A few dozen meters away, there were women washing clothes, and they heard the footsteps and talking. Noticing the unfamiliar voices, they turned to see an unfamiliar young man and young girl walking over. They ignored the rest of the unwashed clothes and quickly put everything into the wooden basin. Their eyes were filled with vigilance and they were slightly flustered. Then they quickly picked up their wooden basins and rushed back into the village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge felt doubt toward this. The two of them looked at each other and couldn’t find anything strange. In order not to reveal their identities, they weren’t wearing the sect’s sword robes. One was wearing a black shirt and pants, while the other had a blue silk dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither of them understood why those women would look at them with such expressions; they didn’t look that terrifying. They continued to walk toward the village with doubt in their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just after entering the village, Zhao Jiuge frowned and even Bai Qingqing had a serious expression. There were only about 20 to 30 people holding farming tools standing around an old man. They walked toward them with unkind expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man in the middle man had a head of grey hair. His back was hunched and he had a cane in his hand. He wore loose, white clothing. Although he was old, his wrinkle-filled face was filled with a sense of prestige. He was carefully looking at Zhao Jiouge and Bai Qingqing. The people around the old man were all young males, and their group continued to grow as people slowly gathered. Even some of the women gathered, and after a few minutes, more than 100 people had completely blocked the village entrance. One could still see figures gathering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was suddenly dumbfounded and panicked a bit from the momentum. Although he didn’t understand what was happening, from their expressions, they were not welcoming them. On the side, Bai Qingqing coldly looked at this without making a sound. She was waiting to see what would happen. They had more people, but in the end, they were all mortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the old man in the center slowly walked out from the crowd. He silently observed the young man and young girl for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt a bit embarrassed because he was waiting for the old man to speak first. Just as he was about to ask what the situation was, a rough voice echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you guys from that dog shit? I’m telling you now, unless you kill everyone in our village, don’t even think about taking a single person from our Iron Mouth Village!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A burly man next to the old man stood out and cursed at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. He was wearing a white vest with undone buttons in the front. His hairy chest and muscular arms were not covered at all, and he had a vicious expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the burly man’s words, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing looked at each other. They knew that something must have happened for this situation to occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge made his expression a bit more friendly. He calmly smiled and raised his eyebrows. “I believe there is some misunderstanding, this is our first time here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The burly man was about to continue speaking when the old man stopped him. “Er Huzi, shut up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His tone was indisputable, and the man named Er Huzi immediately shut up. It seemed like this old man had great prestige.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grey-haired old man turned toward Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing and asked, “You say this is your first time here. Why did you two come here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know how to answer this question, so he turned toward Bai Qingqing with a questioning gaze. However, Bai Qingqing had a calm expression and acted like she didn’t see Zhao Jiuge’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering a bit, Zhao Jiuge could only say, “We are looking for someone. We passed by and saw smoke, so we hoped to stay for the night. I didn’t expect the situation to be like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” The old man’s eyebrows slightly furrowed and he thought for a moment. In his heart, he believed this young man from what he saw. These two were not only young, very high class—they didn’t look like people who would work under that piece of dog shit. Not to mention there was no report of a girl working under that piece of dog shit. However, as the village chief, he had to be cautious because this matter affected the lives of all the unmarried girls in the village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man thought for a long time and then slowly said, “Since you’re not people under that piece of dog shit, then you two can leave. Right now, the village is not peaceful and does not welcome outsiders. Please understand and don’t be offended.” After he spoke, he stared at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing, watching their reactions.</span></p>

He pulled Bai Qingqing’s tender hand to leave, but at this moment, Bai Qingqing, who had been silent this whole time, suddenly spoke.</span></p>

The burly man became angry and said, “This is our village’s problem, it has nothing to do with outsiders like you. Hurry up and leave, we don’t welcome you.”</span></p>

They all began to shout in righteous indignation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But neither Zhao Jiuge nor the villagers expected that not only would Bai Qingqing speak, but she would also make her move.</span></p>

The villagers all exclaimed when they saw the Wind Flower appear in Bai Qingqing’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of her dress fluttered and the Wind Flower shined in Bai Qingqing’s hand. Her alluring eyes were extremely cold at this moment.</span></p>

Bai Qingqing was afraid of alerting the enemy, so she only revealed Blood Movement Realm strength.</span></p>
