 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Looking at the slightly lazy Bai Qingqing, he asked, “What is all the noise outside? Could it be they came to argue endlessly with us again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll know once we go outside,” Bai Qingqing said without any care. At the same time, she lightly brushed her hair and got off the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pushing open the door, they almost ran into someone. Zhao Jiuge looked up and saw that it was the old village chief. Perhaps the old village chief didn’t expect the Zhao Jiuge to open the door now. He was a bit embarrassed but soon recovered. “You came out I was going to call you guys. Yesterday, the village folk heard that you were going to deal with that piece of dog shit. They wanted to send you guys off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge only understood the reason now. When he went out with Bai Qingqing, he was startled. The old village chief’s house was surrounded by three layers of people. There were not only only men, even young women and children were mixed in among them. They were all staring at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge being shocked by this scene, the old village chief patiently explained, “These villagers are very grateful that you two are here to deal with that piece of dog shit, so they wanted to see you two. There is no other reason.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of people looked at Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing with a complicated expressions. There was gratitude, confusion, doubt, curiosity, and mostly hope. Those who hadn’t experienced these suffocating days where they were constantly afraid that their daughter or relative might be taken would not understand. Similarly, others would not understand the feeling of having someone suddenly appear and say they could resolve this issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt a bit emotional as he looked at those faces. Only at this moment did he understand how lucky he was to have strength and what a sense of accomplishment it was to help people with that strength. He was not afraid of hard work. Hadn’t he quietly cultivated to increase his strength just for this moment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To kill all the evil doers in the world and right all the wrongs in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge’s eyes became determined and a killing intent surged in his heart. Even cold Bai Qingqing was somewhat moved by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those eyes filled with hope and faces filled with complicated expressions moved both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled, but there was a complicated feeling in his heart. “We won’t let you all down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was not loud, but it seemed to be filled with great power. Those few words represented great confidence. Looking at the young man’s confident smile, the skeptical gazes in the crowd gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing gently pulled Zhao Jiuge to leave. Perhaps the atmosphere here was a bit oppressive and she was not used to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them had already asked where Han Songcheng was hiding yesterday. With their strength, they completely crush Han Songcheng, so they were going to directly find him. They were not afraid of any schemes that Han Songcheng might have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them greeted the old village chief and Cai Na before they walked toward the village entrance. The crowd automatically scattered, opening a path for them to walk through. After Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing walked through the crowd, they turned back and saw that the people of the village were following them under the order of the old village chief. It seemed like they were going to send them off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing didn’t reject their good intentions. She continued to walk toward the village entrance. However, their steps became even more happy because the hopes of all these villages were now pinned on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them walked out of the village and stepped onto the stone bridge, they looked back. The villagers had stopped, but they hadn’t dispersed. They quietly stood there and sent them off with their gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had grown up in this kind of environment, so he had good feelings toward this village. He smiled brilliantly at them and waved goodbye. He was ready to get on his flying sword with Bai Qingqing to search for Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However just at this moment an arrogant laughter broke this silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hahaha, so lively. All these people are here to welcome me, Han Songcheng? It seems you have already prepared a beautiful girl for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two rays of spirit light flew in from the distance, and when they got close, they were revealed to be two flying swords. Although the swords were shiny, they were not very high quality, only magic treasure quality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword in front was a grey sword, and a 40-year-old man was standing on it. He had long hair that was casually draped over his shoulders. He wore a green coat and looked somewhat elegant. Although he was already middle-aged, one could see that he was handsome when he was younger. He had probably ruined a lot of women when he was young. Those words just now came out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword behind him was a blood-colored sword with an old man with wrinkled skin standing on top. He gave off a gloomy aura and had a pair of terrifying eyes. His whole body was wrapped in a black robe and he had a very unique-looking hook nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another person standing on the old man’s flying sword. It was a shifty-looking, skinny man who was short and had a lecherous smile on his face. Just one look and people would find him disgusting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three people, two flying swords. There were at least two Foundation Realm cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the three people closing in, Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge’s pupils shrank. In particular, when they saw the man in blue leading the way, they were shocked. This person was Han Songcheng. When they received the task, they had seen a picture of his face. Before, Zhao Jiuge thought that Han Songcheng was a rough and burly man, different from the elegant middle-aged man before him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them didn’t hide their spirit force at all. Perhaps they thought that with their cultivation, they could do as they wished in Yellow Flower Ridge. Aside from Han Songcheng, who was at the late stage of the Foundation Realm, the gloomy old man was at the early stage of the Foundation Realm. As for the skinny, lecherous man behind the old man, he had just reached the Spirit Detecting Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if Bai Qingqing had noticed the person who was secretly spying on them, she could have found the skinny, lecherous man. After they arrived yesterday, they were found by this skinny lecherous man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt angry and wanted to laugh at the same time. He was angry that he had finally found this damn piece of dog shit. He wanted to laugh because this piece of dog shit had come to him instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the two rays of spirit light closed in and stopped about 100 to 200 meters away from Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The skinny, lecherous man laughed and then whispered to Han Songcheng, “Mountain Lord, that girl is the one I told you about. How about it? Is she extraordinary? I have never met anyone this beautiful. She is a lot better than those mountain village girls.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man nodded and added, “Really not bad. Looking at her, she should be a cultivator. It’s a pity.” Bai Qingqing was young and was hiding her cultivation, so the old man thought that she was very weak, perhaps a disciple that had come out to travel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng looked down. A water-blue silk dress that swayed in the wind and black, silk-like hair scattered behind her. There were a few naught strands of hair that stuck to the side of her alluring face. At 19, Bai Qingqing’s chest was well developed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Han Songcheng’s heart ripple. She was indeed very good. A light that only men could understand appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His men suddenly returned yesterday to report that two rogue cultivators with flying swords were found. It was estimated that they had other treasures as well. Most importantly, the girl was extremely beautiful. This moved Han Songcheng, who was willing to commit any evil. He was already used to killing and stealing, and with a beautiful woman for the taking as well, he simply had to come. He had quickly rushed here with his number one underling to see just how outstanding she was, and also to steal their treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Han Songcheng in the air, the people in the village all exclaimed and panicked. The old village chief told everyone to quiet down and then the noise slowly dissipated. They all looked into the distance with expectation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A young man with a sword on his back and an alluring young girl looked back at the three men with different expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression was a bit serious. It was reasonable that Han Songcheng was here, but he didn’t know where the other Foundation Realm cultivator came from. Fortunately, the old man was only at the early stage of the Foundation Realm, so it was not a big problem. Everything was still within their control even though something unexpected had occurred, so Zhao Jiuge quickly calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge had calmed down, it didn’t mean Bai Qingqing could calm down. Feeling the three of them pointing at her and staring at her with those lecherous gazes, Bai Qingqing didn’t say a word, she directly attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing let out a cold snort and the Wind Flower Sword in her hand shined brightly. She waved her sword and rays of spirit force shot out like thunder toward the three enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From beginning to the end, Bai Qingqing only used Spirit Transformation Realm cultivation to trick the enemy! Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge understood her plan. After all, they had been acquaintances for a while. Zhao Jiuge secretly laughed in his heart because someone was going to suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rays of sword light shocked the three of them, and the skinny, lecherous man panicked. However, when he saw the two people before him remain calm, he also calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man and Han Songcheng was shocked for a moment when they saw the sword energy, because it looked strong. However, when they noticed that it was only Spirit Transformation Realm level, they let out sighs of relief and revealed proud smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them immediately controlled their flying swords to land on the ground. Fortunately, they were high off the ground, so when the rays of sword energy arrived, they were firmly on the ground. They dodged those powerful-looking rays of sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After steadily landing and dodding Bai Qingqing’s sword energy, Han Songcheng revealed a lecherous smile. “The little lady has personality, but I like that. However, you lack moves. Wait until I deal with you. This evening, I’ll show you all kinds of moves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he began to laugh with a treacherous smile. At this moment, he lost interest in the girls in the village and was completely focused on Bai Qingqing. He completely ignored Zhao Jiuge, as he was even younger than Bai Qingqing and was of no threat to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Han Songcheng finished speaking, Zhao Jiuge realized that things were going to be bad and prayed for Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, Bai Qingqing, the angry little lioness, finally erupted. Her roar echoed through the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Han Songcheng, this old lady will castrate you!” Bai Qingqing stopped hiding her cultivation and a powerful pressure spread out. The spirit force pressure of a late stage Foundation Realm cultivator surrounded the three people on the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Bai Qingqing’s expression was cold and her dress moved without any wind. The Wind Flower Sword in her hand shined. At this moment, she was shining brilliantly.</span></p>
