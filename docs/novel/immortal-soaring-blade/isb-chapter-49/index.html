 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An arrogant voice suddenly interrupted the young man’s complaining. “A good dog shouldn’t block the way, stop embarrassing yourself. Since you can’t enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, then scram far away. Don’t block this lord’s path.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the square, a group of people with powerful auras appeared among the crowd. Three large, black horses without a trace of disheveled hair pulled a golden silk wood carriage with gold trimmings. The curtains of the carriage had their edges embroidered with gold and silver. Following that was a group of armed guards that all had extraordinary killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a youth in a robe with a powerful-looking sword behind his back was standing on the carriage and shouting at the young man, with a face filled with disdain. His face was a bit childish, but it contained a hint of viciousness that wasn’t fit for his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pair of cold eyes stared at the young man in the cyan robe. He had a powerful gaze at such a young age. The noisy crowd calmed down as they began to gauge this youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a lot of people coming to join the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, and there was no shortage of people from prominent families. However, seeing how the youth was dressed, they were all secretly shocked. Even the men wearing armor behind him gave off spirit force fluctuations. They were all cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a lot of young girls looked at the youth in white robes with shining gazes. Those with similar backgrounds were looking at him with disdain, jealousy, or disgust. Just like mortals, there was no lack of such emotions in the cultivation world. As for those from worse families or those who had stepped into the cultivation world through luck, they merely watched without revealing anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the youth in white say those humiliating words, the angry young man’s face suddenly stiffened. When he suddenly saw the youth and all the armored men behind the youth, ready to act, it was as if he had found an opening to vent all his anger. He immediately swallowed back his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He earnestly lowered his head and his face was a little red. He had made a fool of himself before many people. There were also many people shouting at him, but he didn’t dare to say a word. He quickly escaped from the front of the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the youth leave in such a pitiful manner, the youth in white couldn’t help but slightly lift his head up in pride and let out a cold snort. Then he jumped and landed on the square. He walked toward the building with his hands behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth in white seemed to enjoy this sense of superiority, as well as the gazes of worship. He quickly walked up to the building, gently bowed, and deliberately shouted, “Junior Bai Zimo, I came specifically to join the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice spread across the entire square with spirit force, causing everyone to remember the name “Bai Zimo” for various reasons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roof of the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A middle-aged man wearing black hemp clothes and a jade-faced youth wearing a yellow sword robe both looked into the distance with their hands behind their backs as they enjoyed the wind blowing into their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Uncle, look at this. Has our Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect really fallen this far? There is not a single good disciple here. Forget talent, just their hearts and personalities are simply too poor.” The youth in the yellow sword robe let out a sigh. There was some anger in his eyes, as well as a hidden sense of worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wu Tianshan, how long has it been since you entered the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect? Why is your personality still so unstable? A sect’s fortune moves in a cycle; it is a very natural thing. In the past, our Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was only a third-rate sect. Then the ancestor of the sect suddenly gained enlightenment and created the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art, making a big breakthrough. This pushed our sect to the top, the leader among the other sects. Although we have fallen, why care so much about it? If you have the time, then you’re better off using it to cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man in black spoke softly and kept looking into the distance without any change in his eyes. There were no spirit force fluctuations coming from his body at all, but for the youth in the yellow sword robe to call him “Martial Uncle,” he was not as simple as he seemed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s just that I’m reluctant. Going back to the past, our Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was at its peak, but now only gets this type of trash, and the numbers are constantly reducing.” The young man named Wu Tianshan coldly glanced at the youth in the square below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect has fallen in recent decades, Yue Hua Academy has been recruiting a lot of disciples. They are ambitious and want to take the position we had in the past. And this year, they have made a lot of movements, but we couldn’t do anything to answer. There has been no good talent among recent generations of disciples, and it is difficult to keep defending. After we go back, I need to go talk to the teacher about some countermeasures. Otherwise, this vicious cycle will continue and our Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect will really fade from people’s minds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man in black finally showed a hint of emotion in his eyes, but he was still looking into the distance. He didn’t look at the youth below at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Tianshan sighed in his heart. He didn’t know which among this year’s batch would be able to enter the inner sect, which one would rise like a star. Right now, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect didn’t lack resources, what they lacked was talent and time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle wind blew by, causing Wu Tianshan to become sober from his heavy mood. He sighed and couldn’t help but feel that time would not wait for him. Then he pursed his lips and his eyes filled with determination. If the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect were to really reach that step, even if he had to risk his life, he would stand by the sect and live or die with it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the square downstairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Bai Zimo walked into the building, the quiet crowd below erupted and began to talk. They all began to talk, only Zhao Jiuge looked on with a cold gaze and quietly listened to the crowd, trying to collect information he hadn't heard of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the square, those youths that were well-off were being accompanied by their families, waiting for the news about acceptance. They were all talking to people and getting to know each other to make friends after joining the sect. Those alone were mostly with poor family conditions and had come to try their luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more people gathered on the square. Most were families accompanying their children. Zhao Jiuge noticed a few groups of people that arrived with no less fanfare than Bai Zimo. Seeing this, Zhao Jiuge’s heart burned with passion. He had never seen something like this before, and this made him even more determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in the square didn’t know that every move, smile, and ugly gesture they made were all seen by the two people on the roof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening for a while, Zhao Jiuge didn’t hear any useful news. He looked at the crowd and took a deep breath. He then stood up and walked toward the building. Whether he got to stay or not all depended on this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Climbing the steps, Zhao Jiuge only felt his heart pound. The two Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect disciples wearing blue robes with silver swords embroidered on their robes saw Zhao Jiuge walk up. Their keen gazes observed Zhao Jiuge from head to toe, absorbing every detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His young face and his clean, black robe covering his thin body gave people a good feeling. Since reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm, the impact of the Sanskrit Heart Sutra was showing, and Zhao Jiuge’s appearance had a more spiritual feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After observing Zhao Jiuge for a while, the two disciples were able to determine his approximate age and gently nodded as Zhao Jiuge nervously looked at them. Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh and, with an excited mood, walked through the door and entered the building. Inside was a large hall, and Zhao Jiuge curiously looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His first impression was that it looked and smelled antique; it was not fancy at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the hall, there were more than a dozen Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect disciples wearing blue sword robes. They were talking one-on-one with young boys and girls of Zhao Jiuge’s age. They all had some spirit force fluctuations, but they were not strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding walls had paintings hanging on them, and they looked particularly sloppy. Zhao Jiuge could not understand them, but he could feel that each word contained sword intent that was very strong. Each stroke was sharp, and this shocked Zhao Jiuge greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then he found that there was a middle-aged man in the hall, but on the cuff of his blue robe were three small silver swords. After pondering a bit, Zhao Jiuge thought of something and began to cycle his spirit force, releasing an aura more powerful than that of the other young boys and girls here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eh?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the change in the hall, not only did the young boys and girls look over, even the middle-aged man with three silver swords on his cuff was surprised. Then his gaze also followed and he began to observe Zhao Jiuge. His eyes widened slightly before standing straight and walking toward Zhao Jiuge with pursed lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man got closer and closer, making Zhao Jiuge more and more nervous. He finally arrived before Zhao Jiuge, and his slightly dark face continued to observe Zhao Jiuge. Afterward, his short beard trembled before he revealed a kind smile. “Did you come to join the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uhuh, yes, Senior. Junior’s name is Zhao Jiuge.” Zhao Jiuge panicked and sincerely nodded. His words were respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man gently nodded and then made a sound through his nose. Then he suddenly grabbed Zhao Jiuge’s left hand and pinched his bone. Afterward, he slowly said, “Go to the third floor to rest until it is time to go to the sect. Save your energy. After all, the trial to enter the sect is not easy.”</span></p>
