 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing’s aura changed, the people of Iron Mouth Village were all shocked and short of breath. At this moment, they felt that this young girl had the potential to deal with Han Songcheng, and they felt hope. Even though they were a distance away from Bai Qingqing, they could still feel the pressure in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If even the villagers could feel the pressure, there was no need to talk about the three being surrounded by this pressure. The skinny, lecherous man was sweating, pale, and shaking—he felt like he was going to suffocate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the gloomy old man’s expression turned ugly when he sensed danger. He didn’t expect to meet someone else in Yellow Flower Ridge with a higher cultivation level than him, not to mention someone so young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only person who wasn’t shocked too much was Han Songcheng. At this moment, all the lecherous intent in his heart disappeared; he didn’t even feel greed toward the dazzling sword in Bai Qingqing’s hand. This alluring young girl before him was at the same cultivation level as him. He had spent decades crawling and rolling his way forward, and he only reached this cultivation level due to some strange encounters. Yet this young girl not even 20 years old had done the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same cultivation level wasn’t enough to force Han Songcheng to retreat—he was thinking about something else. This matter would not be settled so easily, he was afraid there might be some terrifying elders behind this young girl. Only a big sect or powerful force could cultivate such a powerful young disciple, and they were not people he could afford to offend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long ago, he killed the three people at the Daoist temple because he didn’t have anything to worry about, they were alone without any connections. Han Songcheng was not afraid of this young girl just because she had late stage Foundation Realm cultivation. What he was afraid of was that if he dealt with her, then her backing would pop up looking for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, how could Han Songcheng know that the higher the quality of the cultivation method, the faster one cultivates? It was already very good for him to reach this cultivation level, given the trash cultivation method he had found by accident. It has to be said talented people could condense their spirit core in less than 20 years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng was still thinking about the pros and cons. However, Bai Qingqing was already furious and wouldn't give him time to think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three rays of sword energy followed one after the other, this time much stronger. The sharpness even shocked Han Songcheng, and he quickly avoided them. One ray of sword energy went toward the gloomy old man, who could not avoid it. Seeing the sword energy close in, he could only block as there was still a person behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit force inside the gloomy old man surged like crazy and a blood-colored light surrounded his body and collided with the sword energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword energy instantly cut through the blood-colored light, but its power weakened greatly. The gloomy old man could only raise his own flying sword to block this blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the sword energy and sword collided, they created a metallic sound. An invisible shockwave spread out from the center of the collision and the sword energy dissipated. The gloomy old man was forced back a few steps and his right arm was numb. The spirit force inside his whole body was disrupted and he felt a chill spread throughout his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man’s expression suddenly changed and he panicked because he had less than 50% of his spirit force left. Previously, in order to look cool, he had blade soared here and wasted a lot of spirit force. If he knew the situation was going to be like this, he would have never wasted spirit force like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such a short period of time, Bai Qingqing had made the three of them suffer. At this time, Han Songcheng’s expression became ugly because he was lacking spirit force as well. He had also blade soared here, and he could no longer stay calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his head and angrily shouted at the gloomy old man, “Let's fight together, let’s kill her first!” His words were filled with killing intent. Although she was beautiful, his life was more important. If they killed her, he could still get her treasures, and it was obvious at a glance that her sword was extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Han Songcheng finished speaking, the grey sword in his hand buzzed and a spirit force that didn’t belong to Bai Qingqing erupted. His spirit force surged into the sword in his hand and he leaped at Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man moved after hearing Han Songcheng’s words. He endured the soreness in his arm and released what spirit force he had left. They held the advantage in a two-on-one situation. A blood-red light shined while he rushed forward. The two of them pincered Bai Qingqing from the sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge let out a snort of disdain and his expression turned cold. How could they let them teamup on Bai Qingqing? He hadn’t made his move yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sound like flowing water echoed through the air. Although it was soft, in this tense atmosphere, it was like throwing a stone into a calm lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ray of blue light shone from the Blue Plum Sword, and the entire sword trembled while it floated before Zhao Jiuge. Seeing that Bai Qingqing was no longer pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger, Zhao Jiuge also stopped holding back. His mid stage of the Foundation Realm cultivation erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he rushed forward like an arrow. His actions were exactly the same as Bai Qingqing’s, and rays of identical sword energy shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man was startled. Mid stage of the Foundation Realm, another Foundation Realm cultivator. His previously stable mindset collapsed into panic. At full strength, he could only barely put up a fight, and now he was not even at his peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was filled with regret that he hadn’t looked at his fortune before leaving. Although he was cursing in his heart, he didn’t stop moving. He clenched his teeth and held the blood-colored sword before him to resist. He could only pin his hopes on Han Songcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding, ding, ding...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three rays of sword energy hit the gloomy old man’s body and he was forced back three steps. With every step he took, the spirit force around his body dimmed more and made him cry bitter tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy old man could only dodge by retreating, and his expression was extremely ugly. When Han Songcheng saw Zhao Jiuge erupt with Foundation Realm cultivation, his expression finally became ugly. Before, he had ignored Zhao Jiuge as he hadn’t expected them both to be so fierce. It was ridiculous that he was charging them himself. After Zhao Jiuge revealed his cultivation, Han Songcheng had already thought of retreating. They were not at their peak condition and were caught off guard. During a normal situation, he and his subordinate, Vulture, would be able to put up a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to rescue Vulture, but he was being helplessly chased by an angry Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge saw the old man, Vulture, constantly retreat, so he also quickly gave chase. He felt no burden in his heart about killing these scum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about how many evil things they had done and how many girls they ruined, Zhao Jiuge’s gaze became cold and killing intent flowed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The temperature in the surrounding area suddenly dropped—it was obvious that the surroundings had become cooler. Golden spirit force rushed out from Zhao Jiuge’s body with a hint of ice-blue mixed inside. This was his first time materializing his spirit force after tempering his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spirit force rushed toward Vulture, and before the spirit force closed in, Vulture already felt the chill. Even a panicked rabbit would bite, so there was no need to mention him. There was a hint of viciousness as he grabbed the skinny man and threw him toward the spirit force to buy time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly took out a ⅓-meter drum with his left hand. It was yellow and had red edges with two red beads hanging on the edge on a thread of silk. This was Vulture’s most important treasure, the Twilight Drum. He had stolen it from a Spirit Transformation Realm cultivator.</span></p>
