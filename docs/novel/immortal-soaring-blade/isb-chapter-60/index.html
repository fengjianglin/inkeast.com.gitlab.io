 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youths stepped on the paved mountaintop and followed the long-faced youth. The new disciples were filled with excitement. Luo Xie, Wang Baiwang, Liu Yinger, and Zhao Jiuge were excitedly chatting with each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Jiuge, what spell was that? Just from that aura, it was extraordinary.” Wang Baiwan’s loud voice had attracted everyone’s attention. They were also curious about what the name of that powerful spell was. After all, aside from the little greenhorns who started cultivation recently like Zhao Jiuge, everyone else had at least some basic knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zhao Jiuge hadn’t had those fortunate encounters, he would have spent his whole life without knowing about the cultivation world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One life, two fates, three feng shui, four amass, five study.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sometimes fate was something that couldn’t be explained clearly. A small idea could change someone's entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know how to answer this question, so he stuttered a bit with an embarrassing smile and scratched his head. He had just arrived, so he didn’t want to be too special to avoid unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s actions caused a flash of disappointment to appear in Wang Baiwan’s eyes, but he understood. Most people’s magical treasures and cultivation methods were their personal secrets, so it was natural not to share. Not to mention they were among a crowd right now, so it was indeed a bit embarrassing for Zhao Jiuge. He didn’t want the mood to get cold, so he quickly changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When we begin cultivating in a few days, come to me for spirit stones, I’ll take care of it!” After Wang Baiwan finished speaking, his fat face revealed a proud smile. He revealed a storage ring on his finger. It looked ordinary, but it occasionally released flashes of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt envy when looking at the ring. Luo Xie was staring lecherously at Liu Yinger when he heard this, and he quickly turned. Then he stared at Wang Baiwan with his lecherous gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seriously?” Luo Xie let out a happy shout and his mouth curved upward in a big smile. As someone from a poor family, of course he wanted to have external resources fed to him. After all, he had heard about this but had never received anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Baiwan nodded and the fat on his face moved with him. Liu Yinger gently shook her head and spoke in a soft voice, “I don’t need it. If there are extras, just give them to Zhao Jiuge and Luo Xie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The simple sentence startled Wang Baiwan for a moment, but he quickly resumed his smiling expression. Just because he was generous, that didn’t mean he was stupid. He had grown up in a well-off family, so of course he wasn’t dumb. Liu Yinger’s words meant that her family was no weaker than his. He originally wanted to make a few friends, but he found that the water ran too deep among this batch of disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Xie nodded as he was completely blinded by the promise of spirit stones. The more for him, the better. He was not going to be polite when it came to Wang Baiwan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhao Jiuge revealed a faint smile. He was very humble. He didn’t refuse and didn’t look particularly happy about it. His calm attitude made Wang Baiwan feel that Zhao Jiuge was a bit elusive. From his first impression, he knew Zhao Jiuge was born in an ordinary home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after Zhao Jiuge showed off his extraordinary cultivation and spell on the stairs, he seemed even more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Yinger’s pair of beautiful eyes frequently stared at Zhao Jiuge, and her eyes were filled with color. When Wang Baiwan noticed this, he began to crack jokes, and they were having a good time talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the people who were talking didn’t notice that the alluring girl was watching Zhao Jiuge. She was filled with curiosity about Zhao Jiuge. Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo were also observing Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An inexplicable anger ignited in Bai Zimo when he thought about how Zhao Jiuge had passed him. He looked at Zhao Jiuge with eyes filled with hatred. He was extremely jealous and could not stand others being even a bit stronger than him. His eyes were filled with resentment as he stared at Zhao Jiuge happily talking to the others, and he secretly engraved this moment in his heart. Another thing that he remembered was Mu Zijun. As for the alluring girl, he felt no hatred as she was only a girl, only a sense of conquest. He vowed he would knock on each of their doors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Mu Zijun coldly stared at Zhao Jiuge with his gloomy eyes. Back on the third floor, he vaguely felt that Zhao Jiuge didn’t like him. Although he didn’t know why, he knew he could no longer get along with that group. He was arrogant as well and wouldn’t bother trying to get friendly with someone who disliked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When did he ever lack people to talk to?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu Zijun felt anger due to embarrassment, then he thought about the spell that Zhao Jiuge had shown that was no weaker than his family’s secret spell, and a vicious plan appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge was just talking—how could he know that three people were now targeting him? Sometimes, trouble finds its way to your door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the square made of blue stone at the top of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three instructors stood there and observed the new batch of disciples. Their eyes were filled with expectation because new blood meant hope!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just now, you all were assigned your own rooms and given disciple manuals. After I inform you all of a few things, you all can go back to rest for the day. Get used to the environment and read up on the disciple manuals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Instructor Zhou finished speaking, he paused and looked around. He found that everyone was very quiet and wasn’t making a scene. He secretly nodded and then continued with a stoic face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect is divided into the inner and outer sects. After cultivating for three years, if your results are excellent, you will have a chance to enter the inner sect and find a teacher. And if you’re unfortunate enough to not be able to join the inner sect, you can only spend the rest of your life in the outer sect learning some shallow spells. In addition, the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect cares about sect contribution. You can go to the Duty Hall to complete a mission in exchange for sect contribution. The amount of sect contribution depends on the mission. Right now, you guys can only take some of the smallest missions. After you join the inner sect and become powerful, completing a mission can even get you a high quality spirit treasure from the sect! These sect contributions can be exchanged for refining materials, pills for cultivation, and mysterious spells. Everything will depend on your sect contribution. The last thing is that this batch will be divided into three schools led by myself, Instructor Li, and Instructor Wang. Come here early tomorrow morning for class, and if there's anything you don’t understand, read the disciple manuals you were given.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The information brought by this long speech made Zhao Jiuge ecstatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that you could complete missions to obtain pills, spells, and magical treasures made Zhao Jiuge’s heart pound. After witnessing the power of magical treasures, he had longed for more. Right now, all he had was the Purple Gold True Fire Gourd he had stolen from Daoist Yi Qing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not afraid of any danger or difficulties, nor was he afraid that he wouldn’t have the perseverance. He was only afraid that no matter what he did, he would have no chance of achieving his goal. Now that he had heard about sect contribution, he felt like he was dreaming. He believed that with his effort, he could get what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three years! For these next three years, he would definitely work hard. Since he had entered the Mysterious Sword Sect, he didn’t want to waste his life in the outer set in mediocrity. This would make Su Su very disappointed, and by what virtue would he have to prove himself before Bo Re?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt very happy, as if he had eaten honey. His fist was clenched and his lips were pursed as he told himself in his heart that he could definitely do it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, Zhao Jiuge finally saw the wonders of the mysterious cultivation world, and today was merely the beginning of this road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At dusk, Zhao Jiuge arrived at his own room. Each room housed two people, and by coincidence, the person living with Zhao Jiuge was Luo Xie. The two of them were very happy to meet again. In particular, Luo Xie was so excited to enter the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect that he hadn’t even entered the room and wanted to look around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge refused him. At this moment, he just wanted to study the disciple manual and how to trade for stuff. Those were the things that made his heart burn with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the new outer disciples could only walk around the surrounding few peaks. The rest of the areas were restricted for the new disciples. Zhao Jiuge felt like it was not worth looking around. Also, they had to stay here for at least three years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge didn’t want to go, Luo Xie felt helpless and went out to explore on his own in high spirits. Class was going to start tomorrow, so it was best to do what he wanted now. He had just arrived here and was filled with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Luo Xie left, Zhao Jiuge turned around and examined the room he would be staying in for the next three years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What first appeared before him was a large hall in the middle. The middle of the room was empty, with two long, rectangular, wooden tables in the middle meant to be used while sitting on the floor. The wooden table was flat and the corners were slightly raised up. The pale yellow wooden table exuded a faint fragrance of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a black, common-looking mat between the two tables. It looked very ordinary, but when Zhao Jiuge sat down, it was very soft. In the corner of the hall were a few pots of green plants, and there were few paintings hanging on the wall. One of them attracted Zhao Jiuge’s eyes. It had three powerful and flamboyant words on it: “Tranquility and Devotion”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge muttered those words as he sat on the mat. Not only did those three words contain powerful sword intent, they also seemed to contain a hidden meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the two sides of the hall were two round, arched doors carved from red wood. The red wood didn’t have any complex patterns, it was very simple. Behind the door was a wooden bed without any decorations. It had a layer of clean and simple cotton sheets. The two beds were directly across from each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire room was very simple, but Zhao Jiuge was very satisfied with this simple, quaint, and imposing structure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just sat there and opened the new disciple manual with anticipation. He wanted to fully understand the situation.</span></p>
