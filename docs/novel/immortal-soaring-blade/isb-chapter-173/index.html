 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

In terms of talent and intelligence, I’m not as good as Junior Brother. However, the master found that I’m more stable, I have better long-term vision, and better awareness of the overall situation. Teacher handed the position to me because even if I can’t carry the sect to greatness, I can at least maintain it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Jian Wuxian finished speaking, the other two suddenly understood. If Jian Wuxian had never said this, they would never know. In addition, the two of them had no interest in the position of head teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxie was too casual and lazy. He also knew that his temper was too impulsive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Jian Wuxuan, he was too young back then and could not handle the heavy responsibility. He was also too emotional and quick to act. His qualities would be a disaster for the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What I want to say is that with everything I do, I naturally have my own intentions and considerations. Like what you said about how there is no one decent among the new disciples in our Mysterious Heaven Peak, but that is merely on the surface. Since the creation of the sect, when have the other two peaks ever suppressed us? Junior Brother, you’re still a bit too naive; you must see the flower inside the fog. The things on the surface might not necessarily be the truth. In addition, there are a few dazzling disciples among this generation.” Jian Wuxian slowly told them his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, Jian Wuxian looked back outside at the endless, green peak with his profound gaze, and his voice was somewhat ethereal. “Look at it, the wind outside is surging. All the other holy lands have become restless. My Mysterious Heaven Sword Peak has been silent for over 100 years. It's time for the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect to stir the wind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Jian Wuxie, who usually ignored everything, became serious. It would soon be the disciple competition between the Seven Holy Lands and then the Battle Competition between all the sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing the outstanding disciples of the other Holy Lands, how would their Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect fair?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed especially past during cultivation. In the blink of an eye, half a month flew by. When it was one day before the training exercise, Zhao Jiuge opened his eyes. His eyes shined brightly—it seemed like his cultivation had improved a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xie had already disappeared somewhere. When Zhao Jiuge got off the bed and moved his body, he couldn’t hide the smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After half a month of cultivation, he felt like he was going to reach the late stage of the Foundation Realm soon. He had also pondered the Mysterious Heaven Sword Art. Right now, he was at his peak and ready for the training tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he had some idle time, Zhao Jiuge decided to go find Bai Qingqing to discuss the plan for tomorrow. After all, he now had 20 to 30 people following him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about Fu Hongling, Zhao Jiuge went to the Lotus Peak once more. When he saw that Fu Hongling was still not there, he felt a bit depressed. He could only sigh and fly toward Bai Qingqing’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he arrived in Bai Qingqing’s courtyard, he saw her watching the flowers bloom. That serene appearance was completely different from normal—it was like she was a different person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing the sound of footsteps, Bai Qingqing’s brow furrowed, thinking that it was someone else who was here to bother her. She prepared herself to erupt until she saw Zhao Jiuge. She was surprised. During all this time, Zhao Jiuge rarely came to her place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cool voice came from Bai Qingqing. “Something the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t just come to see you?” Zhao Jiuge secretly observed Bai Qingqing. He was afraid she was going to get him back for wrapping his arm around her half a month ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s face was filled with contempt and she pouted. “Oh? This is really a rare occasion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled in embarrassment. He didn’t want to argue with Bai Qingqing on this. “How is your preparation for the training tomorrow. Are we going together?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing had a cool expression and plainly said. “Whatever, I don’t want to be with your friends. Either I go alone or the two of us go together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you fine alone?” Zhao Jiuge stared at her in shock. Although he was used to Bai Qingqing doing things alone, there were no rules in this training. The three peaks add up to almost 500 people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s not fine about it? If one comes, I’ll take from one. If a group comes, I’ll take from the entire group.” Her voice was proud and calm—this was Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I’ll stay with you, lest you be eliminated before it even starts.” Zhao Jiuge acted like he didn’t care, but he was thinking about how to protect his group of friends so that they could benefit. All he needed to do was ensure that the Mysterious Heaven Peak won so that everyone got the 200 sect contributions, and he needed to rank in the top three to get the precious treasure-grade flying sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing snorted in disdain. She didn’t give Zhao Jiuge any face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge staring with shifty eyes at her waist, the anger in her erupted immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge felt like something was wrong and let out a laugh. He then quickly ran away from the yard before Bai Qingqing could attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, the dazzling sun rose into the sky and shone down on the entire Mysterious Heaven Mountain Range. The entire Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect became lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could see countless rays of flashing lights in the sky. They were either people on colorful flying swords or riding strange spirit beasts. Even the air seemed to be infused with a sense of tense excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the new disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak had long gathered here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was wearing a blue sword robe that reflected the vitality of their youth. There was excitement on their slightly childish faces as today they were representing the Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those unfathomable senior brothers and sisters were all looking at them with hope. They whispered to each other while pointing at the new disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same scene was likely occurring at the Mysterious Fallen Peak and the Mysterious Strange Peak!</span></p>

He felt disappointed, but that disappointment was soon diluted by the surrounding atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the three instructors appeared, the entire atmosphere was completely ignited. The three instructors seemed to be very satisfied with the spirit of this generation of disciples. They had big smiles on their faces while they looked at the new disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, everyone, be quiet.” Instructor Li wrapped his voice in spirit force so it would echo across the square. He stepped forward and waved, then everyone quieted down, including the older disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today is the day that all of you represent the Mysterious Heaven Peak. I won’t say more, I just hope you all display your true strength and display the brilliance of our Mysterious Heaven Peak. We instructors and your senior brothers and sister will wait for your triumphant return. We also look forward to your performance during the training exercise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Li ignited the burning hearts of these youths. The Mysterious Heaven Peak had a Mysterious Light Mirror that would display the entire training exercise. Those with powerful cultivation would be able to see everything with their divine sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The training location was Wu Hua Peak. Not only was Wu Hua Peak large, but its sides were steep, and it was shaped like a cone. The disciples of the three peaks would be scattered across the foot of the mountain. There would be no rules and they would all move toward the top of the peak. This would be when the flag stealing would take place. Even if some managed to avoid everyone, they would still have to battle it out at the peak in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instructor Li’s words gave these new disciples a sense of belonging and collective glory. At this moment, they put aside their differences and only had one purpose in mind: to claim victory for the Mysterious Heaven Peak</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go!” In the end, Instructor Zhou let out a roar. The training was finally going to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The older disciples carried their junior brothers and sisters and flew into the air one by one. All the new disciples were burning with passion during the journey to Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the Mysterious Heaven Square, all the older disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak, inner and outer, looked at this with burning gazes. They never had a joint training session with all three peaks before the inner sect selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the blue sword robes fluttered in the air, the blue figures in the sky were like a blue wave rushing forward. Zhao Jiuge felt the wind blowing into his face, making his mind even clearer than before. He was filled with excitement and was trembling involuntarily. He had the urge to compete with the disciples of the other two peaks to see who was stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother, I see how much you’re trembling, but there is nothing to be nervous about. When you see the disciples of the other two peaks, just fight. Beat those you can beat and take their flags. If you encounter someone you can’t beat, then run. Seeing your cultivation level, you should be among the best of this generation.” Perhaps this senior brother had felt Zhao Jiuge trembling behind him, so he smiled and comforted Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, I’m just afraid the other side will have too many people. I’m not afraid of one-on-ones, but there are no rules, so they might gang up on me,” Zhao Jiuge replied respectfully. He began planning for what to do during the training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remember, when you meet the disciples of the other two peaks, if you hold the advantage, then you must not hold back. Teach them a lesson, but don’t kill them. These years, the disciples of the other two peaks have become more and more arrogant. We have suffered quite a bit during our missions outside.” The older disciple was filled with anger and gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they belonged to the same sect, they were part of different factions, so it was common for them to get into disputes with each other in private. Although they wouldn’t kill, if they were injured, they could only suffer in silence. Over the years, the conflict between them had become even more intense, and there was more and more resentment being built up between each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery before them suddenly changed. A vast mountain peak appeared before them and was covered in strange rocks. The whole mountain peak was mostly green like it was wearing a dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Hua Peak was much larger than most of the other peaks. More importantly, the peak was shaped like a cone, and only the peak had been developed. There was a stone platform there, and the rest of the mountain remained in its original state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak were looking at the scenery of Wu Hua Peak, the sounds of objects piercing through the wind echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like locusts, hundreds of figures were already heading toward Wu Hua Peak, only they were not coming from the same direction. They also had two people on each flying sword. Presumably, they were taking the new disciples to the training exercise just like the Mysterious Heaven Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These disciples were wearing yellow sword robes and their youthful faces were filled with excitement. They were the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A similar group appeared, except their sword robes were green. The disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak were headed toward another part of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the disciples of all three peaks were here. They were going to battle and struggle on Wu Hua Peak to display all their effort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This short encounter already ignited the battle intent of all the disciples. They all proudly stood there with looks of contempt for each other on their faces. The training hadn’t even begun and they were already trying to overwhelm their opponents with their auras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, the scene of the three peaks meeting was spectacular but short. Because they were going in different directions, they quickly split apart toward three different locations at the foot of Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
