 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

Aside from Vulture and Zhang Long, no one else had gotten the opportunity to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng and Vulture were inside a room in the innermost courtyard. The two of them were sitting down, recovering their spirit force. This was only one of the living rooms, so the decorations were a bit shabby. It contained a carved green pinewood table, two carved redwood flat stools, and there was a long mouth blue flower teapot. There was also a teacup carved from yellow dragon jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were three carpets made of tiger skin laying on the ground. At this moment, Han Songcheng and Vulture were sitting on them, recovering their spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhang Long’s heart-wrenching scream, Han Songcheng suddenly opened his eyes. Vulture was also awakened by the scream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng frowned and his gloomy face turned a bit ugly. “The illusion formation was unable to trap them, and it seems like Zhang Long’s situation is not good either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture had only recovered 30% of his spirit force. When he heard Han Songcheng say this, he suddenly became nervous. “Then what do we do now?” Originally, they were very confident, but now they were riding a tiger that was difficult to dismount. They hadn’t expected these two to be so powerful despite how young they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng frowned and muttered to himself, “What is their background? How could they have broken the illusion formation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes flickered while he pondered, and a moment later, he suddenly shouted, “Not good! This can’t wait any longer. It's not a problem if they break the illusion formation, since we still have so many people. Zhang Long and Luo Xuqing are too weak, being only at the Spirit Transformation Realm. If we keep waiting here and recover, they will be wiped out one by one.” Han Songcheng didn’t know that Zhang Long’s group of eight had been wiped out already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Han Songcheng’s serious expression and heavy tone, even Vulture panicked a bit. “So what do we do now? Slaughter our way out?” Han Songcheng was the core, and at this moment of crisis, Vulture lost himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng slightly shook his head and frowned. “No, you go out first to stabilize the situation. I’ll come soon. Do you still have the Twilight Dream?” When he spoke, Han Songcheng was still thinking and didn’t look up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Han Songcheng’s words, Vulture was shocked and began to think. He had less than 30% of his spirit force and his cultivation level was lower than Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s. Was Han Songcheng going to give up on him and use him as cannon fodder? At this moment, Vulture hesitated, but due to Han Songcheng’s oppressive nature, he couldn’t refuse. Even though he had the Twilight Drum, the treasure was not without flaws. It consumed a large amount of spirit force, and now that he didn’t have enough, using it would only worsen his condition. Han Songcheng was clearly sending him to his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at this moment, Vulture knew he was wrong to think this. Han Songcheng looked up and took out a light purple spirit pill. His face was filled with reluctance. “You swallow this pill and then go out. I’ll follow soon.” He kept staring at the purple spirit pill while he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This spirit pill was robbed from a cultivator that had passed by. There were three in total. A few years ago, one was used during a crisis, leaving two. Seeing today’s situation, although reluctant, he had to use it. However, materials were not as precious as life. Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing’s abnormal strength had made Han Songcheng feel like something bad was coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he first stepped onto the path of cultivation, Han Songcheng had walked like he was stepping on thin ice and had been very careful. Later, once he became powerful and began to do evil things, he became even more careful. This time, in order to be safe, he could not hold back. He didn’t want to be met with unexpected failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture’s old face trembled. He looked at the spirit pill and revealed unspeakable joy in his eyes. His right hand excitedly grabbed the pill. This was the first time he had looked at this spirit pill so closely. He could now smell its faint fragrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, devour it and let’s go. This spirit pill can recover spirit force to a certain extent.” Han Songcheng felt his heart ache while he spoke. The effect of a spirit pill depended on its quality. The more precious it was, the better the effect. Not only did ordinary pills have worse effects, there might even be negative side effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture impatiently devoured the spirit pill in his hand, and it melted the instant it entered his mouth. He could clearly feel a warm sensation flowing through his body, then spirit force filled his dantian. Feeling his spirit force return, Vulture was ecstatic. Although it wasn’t his peak, it was enough to deal with a battle for now. Confidence filled him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the excited Vulture, Han Songcheng’s gaze suddenly darkened. It was just as Vulture had thought, everyone beside Han Songcheng himself was cannon fodder, even Vulture was no exception. However, he still needed them; otherwise, he would be left with nothing. That was why even though he was unwilling to, he had given Vulture the spirit pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Songcheng sighed and closed his eyes to recover once more. There was another faint purple spirit pill. Unless it was his last resort, he wouldn’t use it. This was why he had sent Vulture out first—if the situation went south, he would still have enough spirit force to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The human heart was selfish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…………….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two bright flying swords filled with killing intent flew toward Luo Xuqing and company. At this moment, Bai Qingqing was completely enraged and didn’t care about the consumption of spirit force. She just wanted to quickly kill this group of scum. Anyone who worked for Han Songcheng naturally couldn’t be good. She was going to kill them without any mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing arrive via blade soar, the six of them became flustered. Moments ago, they were watching Zhang Long and his party suffer, but now it was their turn. Although they felt a sense of pressure, they still moved into position without Luo Xuqing’s command with various treasures in their hands. Their positions looked random, but they were in good positions to help each other out at key moments, and the weapons they had were naturally the lowest tier magic treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Magic treasures had some spirit force inside to increase their lethality, but no other effects. Those that had attribute characteristics were considered precious treasures. Spirit treasures had the spirits of beasts inside, so not only were they powerful, they all had unique characteristics. As for immortal treasures, only the holy lands had a few. They were in the hands of those old monsters that never came out. All immortal treasures had treasure spirits of their own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them saw Luo Xuqing’s group of six, a bright spirit force surrounded Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing. The bright light combined with the flying sword, and their fluttering clothes created a powerful pressure on the six people facing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two explosive sounds. Then a golden and a water-blue surge of cold, violent spirit force surged out like two dragons toward the six people before them. Bai Qinging and Zhao Jiuge had no intent of holding back—they wanted to crush them instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was at the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, one at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, and four at the Blood Movement Realm. Bai Qingqing didn’t consider them a threat at all. Zhao Jiuge was infected by Bai Qingqing and felt a sense of thrill from crushing their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their momentum was monstrous right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six people, including Luo Xuqing, suddenly panicked. Facing the violent spirit force rushing at them, they didn’t know what to do. After all, they never expected to face such a strong offensive right off the bat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit force rushing at them was filled with a cold aura. Before the spirit force arrived, they felt goosebumps on their skin. At this moment, the gap in cultivation levels was reflected. Luo Xuqing and the man in dark clothes immediately reacted—they quickly wrapped themselves in their own spirit force. Then one lifted a black sledgehammer, while the other raised a white iron fan. Spirit force was injected into their weapons and they launched a counterattack to resist.</span></p>

It wasn’t until that bone-chilling spirit force was before them that they reacted, but it was too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The violent and cold spirit force instantly hit the four of them. There were two realms of difference between the Blood Movement Realm and the Foundation Realm, so when the four of them were hit, their bodies suffered varying degrees of damage. There were no traces of blood like before, and the wounds on their limbs had thin layers of ice over them. After such a fierce attack, if they didn’t die, they would be dying. Three of them instantly died on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Xuqing and the man in black clothes relied on their reaction speed and Spirit Transformation Realm spirit force to resist this wave of violent attacks.</span></p>

At this level, it was purely a competition of spirit force. Unlike high level cultivators, who would rely on treasures and special methods to be able to battle people above their level. That was why Bai Qingqing didn’t care if the other party had more people. After all, the gap in their cultivation levels was right there, not to mention she also had her own aces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only at this moment did Luo Xuqing feel sympathy for Zhang Long and regretted his previous decision. Feeling the coldness of death closing in, no amount of regret was enough. Since the situation was already like this, he could only face it head-on. His only hope was that the Mountain Lord would quickly come out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gritted his teeth and waved the dark sledgehammer shining with spirit force. Instead of sitting there and being killed, he might as well try his best to struggle until the Mountain Lord came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Luo Xuqing, who was brandishing the black sledgehammer, Bai Qingqing’s eyes shined. Instead of retreating, she leaped into the air. The Wind Flower Sword flew into her hand in the air. Bai Qingqing landed on the ground, and with a kick from her legs, she faced Luo Xuqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the sword in my hand, the world belongs to me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing the burly Luo Xuqing, Bai Qingqing chose to meet force with force!</span></p>

Her right hand tightly gripped the sword and the Wind Flower moved.</span></p>

Zhao Jiuge had just landed, and he felt like the entire mountain was shaking from the collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dead branches and leaves on the ground were pushed back due to the shockwave. Even the branches and leaves on the trees trembled.</span></p>
