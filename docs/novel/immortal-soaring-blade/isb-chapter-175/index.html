 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Head Teacher Jian Wuxian casually downplay those words, Head Seat Du Junping and Head Seat Zhang Xu looked at each other but didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere instantly became tense. Jian Wuxian had a faint smile on his face. He completely ignored the other six and looked into the distant Mu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Jian Wuxian was motionless and quiet, an invisible sense of pressure spread out from his body. The longer he remained silent, the stronger this feeling became. Du Junping and Zhang Xu felt tense. If they felt tense, then Du Jun and Ye Deyong had to be feeling it even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Du Junping seemed to be unable to withstand this atmosphere. He chuckled and said, “Do you think there are any particularly outstanding disciples among the three peaks?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are a few from our Mysterious Fallen Peak, but they're not too demonic.” When he heard Du Junping bring up this topic, Zhang Xu, who remained had silent and calm, quickly spoke. Although what he said sounded modest, he could not hide the pride he felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? Then I have to congratulate Head Seat Zhang. Our Mysterious Strange Peak doesn't have any good seedlings this time.” Du Junping looked at Zhang Xu with a strange gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Xu’s expression suddenly became heavy, but he knew that Du Junping was always like this. He let out a cold snort and was too lazy to be bothered with Du Junping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the Head Teacher seemed uninterested in the topic, Du Junping was unwilling to give up. He continued, “Head Teacher, who do you think will win in the end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Jian Wuxian’s mouth curved up slightly. This was likely the real question Du Junping wanted to ask, and the purpose of him coming here today was probably not simple either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian calmly answered, “Wait and see. No matter who wins, they are disciples of my Mysterious Heaven Sect. It is an honor for the sect to have outstanding disciples.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Junping’s eyes suddenly burned with passion as he stared at Jian Wuxian. “Head Teacher, the competition between the seven Holy Lands is coming. According to customs, the best disciples will be sent on behalf of the sect. In the past, it was always the disciples of the Mysterious Heaven Peak. I hope that the Head Teacher can change the rules this time. During the inner sect selection, whichever disciple is the most outstanding will go no matter what peak they are from.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Xu was shocked. He didn’t think Du Jinping had the courage to ask for such a thing. However, he realized that this was an opportunity and followed. “Head Teacher, I think what Head Seat Du said is right. The strong should be allowed to go, whoever has the ability should go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxie’s gloomy aura darkened even more. Those two peaks had become even more wanton to dare to ask such things. Jian Wuxuan’s momentum changed too and he began gathering his spirit force. He was waiting for the Head Teacher’s order to teach these two a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere suddenly became tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jian Wuxian revealed no expression and the people here could not read his thoughts. In the past, it was always a disciple from the Mysterious Heaven Peak that went to the competition between the seven Holy Lands. Then, during the Battle Competition, that disciple would lead the team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For nearly 100 years, these spots were represented by a few of his disciples, but this time, Sha Sha was far too young and was a girl. This caused him to hesitate even though Sha Sha’s strength was certainly monstrous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing these two having ideas about it, Jian Wuxian sneered in his heart. However, on the surface, he revealed a mysterious smile. “Yes, then let’s see which disciples are the most outstanding. They will go on behalf of the sect, no matter which peak they are from.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Junping and Zhang Xu’s faces were filled with shock at Jian Wuxian’s words. They didn’t expect him to agree so easily. Du Junping was originally going to test Jian Wuxian, but now that Jian Wuxian agreed, he couldn’t hide the smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After achieving his goal, Du Junping’s eyes revealed an imperceptible amount of light and started to quietly watch the training exercise. For powerful cultivators like them, their divine senses could easily cover the entire peak, so they could each disciple’s every action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…………..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Hua Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two men and a woman with flying swords in their hands were rushing for the top. They were Zhao Jiuge, Bai Qingqing, and Leng Rufeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was as cold as ever and even Leng Rufeng was pretty calm. Only Zhao Jiuge’s breathing was a bit rough, and his eyes were filled with excitement. He was leading the way, quickly running forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing saw Zhao Jiuge like this, she angrily shouted, “What are you so excited for? Why are you walking so fast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leng Rufeng just watched without speaking or showed any expression. He knew that Bai Qingqing didn’t like having him here—she hadn’t spoken to him or even looked at him this whole time. Even though he had a better impression of Bai Qingqing after what happened before, he wasn’t going to try to flatter her. Thus, he decided not to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stopped and turned back to look at Bai Qingqing, who was leisurely strolling. “If we don’t go faster, all the flags will be gone. I’m aiming to win that precious treasure at the end.” After he finished speaking, he looked at the colorful flag that was hanging around Bai Qingqing's waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing already knew what Zhao Jiuge was thinking without him even speaking. She helplessly said, “I said that I’ll help you win the precious treasure, but you have to use the proper methods. Do you think that you will get more flags if you move faster?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge didn’t understand Bai Qingqing’s words. He raised his brows and asked, “Then how should we do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing leisurely said, “We’ll slowly go up. Those that reach the top will be powerful people who have a lot of flags with the,. We’ll directly take them from them and then all the flags will be ours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her demeanor was calm, but her words were filled with self-confidence! Even Leng Rufeng couldn’t help but stare at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Zhao Jiuge was startled by Bai Qingqing. Without a doubt, this method was certainly feasible, direct, and efficient. However, the disciples who would reach the top at the end would be the top disciples of each peak. To beat them all—what a bold idea!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was completely calm and filled with confidence. Her beautiful eyes didn’t waiver at all, like she was not afraid of anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge felt like he had the shadows of two other people.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One was like a cold plum flower, cold and noble, just like when Bo Re faced off against the Cold Flood Dragon.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you looking at?” Seeing Zhao Jiuge silently stare at her for a while, Bai Qingqing frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Zhao Jiuge reacted. “You’re beautiful, so let me get a few extra glances.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was startled, and there was a faint red on her white skin. She ignored Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were talking, Leng Rufeng suddenly shouted, “There’s movement.” He became tense and raised the flying sword in his hand to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of fallen leaves echoed. Not just one or two—the surroundings were filled with this sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flowers and grass were shaking inside the woods, coming closer and closer. When they reached a certain distance, Zhao Jiuge suddenly exclaimed, “Someone is coming, and there is more than one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blue Plum Sword became bright but didn’t erupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s eyebrows furrowed slightly, but she didn’t make any movements. She decided to wait and see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, one could see almost 20 figures moving through the woods toward him. They were wearing green, which meant that they were disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak. They looked tense but were filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quick, we found three people. Surround them!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just three people, while we have so many people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s beat up those Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples. Who told them to act so arrogantly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chaotic footsteps and voices echoed through the woods along with the crackling of leaves being stepped on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, they appeared before the three of them. There were about 17 or 18 of them wearing green sword robes. In addition, the three or four people in front were holding flying swords, while the rest were bare-handed. Some were even holding the wooden swords they were given when they entered the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three or four people standing in front were filled with excitement when they looked at Zhao Jiuge, Leng Rufeng, and Bai Qingqing. They were like hunters who had found prey, but it was hard to tell who was the hunter and who was the prey. The flying swords in their hands were the lowest grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were excitedly looking at Zhao Jiuge’s group, Zhao Jiuge was observing them. When he found that they were all at the Spirit Transformation Realm without a single Foundation Realm cultivator, Zhao Jiuge smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Surrounded? We’ll have to see who is really surrounded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty in front lowered his head and whispered to the honest-looking youth beside him, “They have flying swords, what should we do? Should we attack or tell them to hand over the flags?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth blinked a few times. It was his first time facing this situation, so he didn’t know what to do. He opened his mouth a few times but didn’t say anything. Finally, after a while, he made a decision. “Tell them to hand over the flags. If they don’t, then we’ll deal with them. We have so many people that just one spit from each of us is enough to drown them. If they hand them over, it will be for the best. Once we reach the peak, we’ll hand them to Senior Brother Luo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty wearing green seemed to become more confident after receiving advice from the honest-looking youth. He stepped forward from the crowd and looked down at Zhao Jiuge’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He straightened his back, pointed at Zhao Jiuge’s group, and arrogantly said, “You… You… You… You guys hand over the flags, or else… or else.. Or else don’t blame us for being ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing laughed at this fat disciple. He looked so funny and he kept stuttering his words. He was very cute but had to pretend to be fierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t because he was nervous or he always stuttered, but when he heard Bai Qingqing’s beautiful laughter, he blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge stopped himself from laughing until he couldn’t hold it and began to laugh brazenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little fatty, you… you… you… you better quickly hand over the flag. Or… Or… Or… Or else don’t blame use for being ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Zhao Jiuge finished laughing, he copied the fatty’s stuttering. He didn’t feel tense at all, only contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty’s face became even more red. Before, he was just a bit embarrassed because of how beautiful Bai Qingqing was, but now he was completely angered by Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fatty became angry from embarrassment. “You… You… You, don’t go too far. Do you think you’re amazing just because you’re from the Mysterious Heaven Peak?” He furrowed his brows to look ferocious, but no matter how one looked at him, he looked very funny. There was no ferocity at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The honest-looking youth beside him could no longer hold it and shouted, “Attack, beat those Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples to death. Don’t let them act arrogant again!” Without waiting for anyone else to talk, he took the lead. He was going to attack with full force, regardless of the rules!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dozen or so people were all filled with anger. After hearing the command, they pounced like wolves who saw prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flashes of spirit light appeared one after another, sending out a wave of pressure. However, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing weren’t worried at all, not only because the difference between realms could not be made up with numbers, but also because they were also confident in their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them no longer needed to say anything. They tactfully moved at the same time. At this moment, water blue, gold, and grey spirit lights appeared. Three Foundation Realm pressures ferociously rushed toward the opposing side.</span></p>
