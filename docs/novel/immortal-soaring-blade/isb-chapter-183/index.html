 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after Ling Longbiao was seriously injured and taken away by the disciples of the Enforcement Hall did Chen Jie and Zhang Pingquan’s group return to their senses. Their gazes seemed to be spitting fire while they looked at Zhao Jiuge, their killing intent surging. When Leng Rufeng was beaten, Zhao Jiuge went crazy, and when Ling Longbiao was beaten, they were the same. The bond between fellow disciples was not something outsiders could understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had beaten three people in a row and looked like he was running out of energy. The golden light around his body dimmed, but the mysterious, smiling Buddha still remained. It looked so peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sleeve around Zhao Jiuge’s right arm was completely destroyed and he was staring at Chen Jie’s group of five. His gaze was gloomy, but he didn’t attack. Perhaps it was because he had exhausted almost all of his spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chen Jie, deal with him first. I’ll hold this one off.” Zhang Pingquan’s voice was cold. It was 12 versus three, yet they had actually suffered four losses. How could she not be angry?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the battlefield, the situation was always changing rapidly. While Zhang Pingquan was issuing her command, Bai Qingqing took advantage of this moment. The other two disciples of the Mysterious Strange Peak were still stunned by what had happened. She instantly sent out two rays of silver sword energy and hit those two Foundation Realm disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they reacted in time to protect themselves with spirit force, Bai Qingqing’s Wind Flower Sword was top quality even among spirit treasures. How could they possibly resist? Not everyone had spells as abnormal as Zhao Jiuge’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two rays of silver sword energy instantly broke through the spirit force protecting their bodies, then blood splattered on the ground. One was hit on his right shoulder and a large wound opened up. The other was hit in his right arm, causing his right arm to fall limp. He even dropped the flying sword he was holding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s use of the sword art and spirit force control had already reached this level. She had an extremely good grasp of her strength and could accurately launch her attacks to not kill the enemy. If those two rays of sword energy had hit their abdomens, they would have both died already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan felt her chest become stuffy and her vision went dark for a moment. However, her fighting spirit soon returned to her body.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if we fight one-on-one, I’m not much weaker than you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Pingquan clenched her teeth and rushed toward Bai Qingqing. It had taken three of them to suppress Bai Qingqing—how could she do it alone? With her precious treasure-grade flying sword and her cultivation, she could still barely hold Bai Qinqing off. However, she was at a disadvantage and the situation was very bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing was startled for a moment. She hadn’t expected Zhang Pingquan to become even braver—this even caused a little trouble for her. In particular, Zhang Pingquan’s understanding of the sword art was not below her own, so every blow was powerful, shocking Bai Qingqing. If she had a spirit treasure, then even if Bai Qingqing won, she would have to pay a price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know that Zhang Pingquan was undoubtedly the most talented among all the Mysterious Strange Peak disciples. Not only was her cultivation speed fast enough to reach the late stage of the Foundation Realm, her control of the sword art was incomparable. Zhang Pingquan was also from an ordinary family, so she didn’t enjoy all the resources those disciples from influential families had since childhood. Not only did the instructors praise her, even the Mysterious Strange Peak’s Head Seat, Du Jun, was secretly observing her. He was pinning a lot of hope on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between the two of them, Zhang Pingquan was at a disadvantage, but Bai Qingqing could not deal with her quickly. The two of them entered a stalemate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they were entangled, Zhao Jiuge took out a small jade bottle. The bottle was blue and white and gave off a cool feeling. Then Zhao Jiuge took out a dark red pill. It was the Little Huan Pill that Bai Qingqing had given him before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint smell of medicine came from the pill. Zhao Jiuge didn’t hesitate much while holding the pill and threw one into his mouth. Right now, his spirit force was almost completely drained, so he had to rely on pills to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Little Xuan Pill turned into liquid inside his body and spirit force violently rushed through him. He could feel his spirit force increasing. It was at this moment that Zhao Jiuge realized how precious the Little Xuan Pills were. As for exactly how precious, he didn’t know as he didn’t have any experience with alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his spirit force was recovering, it would take time for the spirit force to gather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Jie’s group of five would not give Zhao Jiuge the chance to recover. Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s actions, he realized that Zhao Jiuge was almost out of spirit force. He felt regret allowing Zhao Jiuge to injure Ling Longbiao under his watch. With such a good opportunity presented to him, how could he let it go?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit force surged from his body. In order to seize time, Chen Jie didn’t even use the sword art, which he wasn’t that skill at, and directly sent spirit force toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Mysterious Strange Disciples all reacted and followed Chen Jie’s actions. Two rays of sword energy and two rays of spirit force swept toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, five attacks from Foundation Realm cultivators blasted toward Zhao Jiuge. Chen Jie let out a cold snort in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter how strong your defense is, you don’t have much spirit force left. No matter what powerful methods you have left, you can’t do anything without spirit force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Facing this fierce offensive, even Zhao Jiuge panicked a bit. However, there was no point in regretting anything now. At most, he would just be beaten and take a few months to recover, not to mention he still had an ace he hadn’t used yet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the layer of golden light around Zhao Jiuge’s body suddenly dimmed as if he didn’t have enough spirit force left. Then it shined brightly once more. It flickered back and forth for a while. When those five attacks closed in, Zhao Jiuge pushed the Sanskrit Divine Body to the extreme to resist those attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thunderous rumble echoed and Zhao Jiuge’s body trembled. The golden light around him dimmed and even the little spirit force he had just recovered was exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge had just stabilized himself when two more rays of spirit force flew toward him. The golden light around him had dimmed and looked like it could break at any moment. Even the mysterious, smiling Buddha shrouding Zhao Jiuge had disappeared due to the lack of spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The successive attacks caused Zhao Jiuge to feel dizzy. The last two rays of energy had taken more time to execute and therefore had fallen behind, but in the blink of an eye, they arrived as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two sharp rays of sword energy tore apart the weakened golden light and landed on Zhao Jiuge’s body. The blue sword robe on his body was torn apart by the sword energy, but because of the strength of his body, he wasn’t injured further. However, seven or eight wounds had appeared and blood was flowing out. At first it was only a faint stain of blood, but soon the entire blue sword robe was dyed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s handsome face became distorted from the pain, but he remained standing. His brows furrowed, but he didn’t let out a cry. Bai Qingqing, who had been entangled by Zhang Pingquan, saw this and she suddenly felt herself go mad. She desperately waved the Wind Flower Sword even more ferociously. Her spirit force surged, forcing Zhang Pingquan, who was already struggling, into an even worse situation. She wasn’t going to be able to hold on for much longer.</span></p>

They had complicated expressions on their faces and felt like Zhao Jiuge could not last much longer. However, at this moment, they saw Zhao Jiuge take out a palm-sized drum!</span></p>

His actions confused Chen Jie’s group of five. They knew this drum was a treasure, but it didn’t seem to have much offensive power.</span></p>

She paused and slowly said, “This last slap is for all those Mysterious Heaven Peak disciples that suffered from the insidious methods of your Mysterious Strange Peak. See if you dare to act so arrogantly before our Mysterious Heaven Peak again.”</span></p>
