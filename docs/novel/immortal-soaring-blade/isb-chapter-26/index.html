 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his cold words echoed, the surroundings became completely silent. One by one, they all looked at the ordinary-looking youth that was like a proud lion. The words “Flowing Cloud Sect” was enough to deter everyone here. It was the only sect near Dong Yang City, and while it was not a holy land, it was still an existence the people here could only look up to. Liu Feng seemed satisfied with the reaction of the people around him. He then looked provocatively at the Mo family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Mo’s eyes became anxious. Why hadn’t Zhao Jiuge arrived &nbsp;yet? However, hearing Liu Feng’s words, he calmed down once more and secretly looked at the youth before him. He thought that if he won this round, then perhaps Zhao Jiuge wouldn’t need to fight, so he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Lingjie calmly looked at the field. Liu Feng gave off a strange feeling, but he didn't know why. Mo Linger’s exquisite face was filled with worry as she looked around, wondering why Big Brother Jiuge still hadn't arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dong Yang City, Old Mo.” His kind smile was gone and he looked very serious as he observed Liu Feng’s every move. Even the surrounding audience held their breath to see what was so different about a disciple of the Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Feng let out a sneer filled with disdain and spirit light surrounded his body. Everyone was shocked as he stepped into the sky and calmly looked down at everyone before turning to Old Mo. It turned out that Liu Feng had been hiding his cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An uproar echoed across the surroundings. Standing in the sky! That was the sign of a Foundation Realm cultivator. Being able to reach such a realm at this age showed that he was worthy of being a disciple of a sect. Everyone thought that the Mo family was doomed. The Xiao family’s eldest son had entered the Dong Yun Sect. With a backing like that, they could soar into heaven in Dong Yang City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden change also shocked the people of the Mo family. When Xiao Yi saw the Mo family’s reactions, he revealed a cold smile and thought, “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just wait until you lose, then I’ll show you all</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">.” Old Mo panicked as he looked at the spirit force that was ready to attack him. He prepared himself to defend with all his might. Mo Longjie’s calm face tightened, but he didn’t panic, he just calmly said, “We concede defeat this round.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Feng sneered. After Mo Longjie conceded, the spirit force moved. It was like a burning sun had descended upon Old Mo and swept him away. The red spirit fire devoured Old Mo in an instant and he was forced back a dozen steps. There was a burnt smell coming from his body and his face was miserably pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After one move, he surged his spirit force for a second attack. Mo Longjie’s expression was gloomy as he stepped forward and shouted, “That’s enough, we admit our defeat this time.” At the same time, he coldly stared at Liu Feng. If Liu Feng continued, Mo Longjie wouldn’t mind stepping in. Although the Flowing Cloud Sect was strong, the Mo family was not someone who would allow others to bully them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Feng revealed a look of disdain and turned away without even looking at Mo Longjie. In the distance, Zhao Jiuge was running toward here, and he had seen Liu Feng strike Old Mo down. Seeing how the other party was flying in the air, there was dread in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Zhao Jiuge arrive, the people of the Mo family released sighs of relief. When Zheng Jie saw the lively youth arrive with spirit force fluctuations even stronger than a month ago, he couldn’t help but sigh. He feared that he could never catch up to this youth before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, you dared to come. I said that I was going to deal with you in a month. Today, you’ll see that this old man was not joking.” Seeing Zhao Jiuge arrive, Xiao Yi revealed a vicious smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then it will depend whether you have the ability.” After reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm, he had gone into the mountains to test the power of being able to materialize his spirit force. Surprised by the increase in power, he had also become more confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yun was a bit surprised by the handsome young man before him. “So it’s you who hurt my brother and stole his magic treasure. So young yet already so vicious.” Although he showed contempt on the surface, he was a little cautious. From the fluctuations of spirit force, this youth was at the Spirit Transformation Realm but was only 15 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge didn’t know that each side had won and lost one in the first two rounds, leaving the burden of the last fight to him. However, after reaching the Spirit Transformation Realm, he had become confident. “I’ll return your father’s words to you. Strength is respected, no need to waste time speaking all that nonsense.” A faint smile appeared on his face, and the spirit force from his body shocked the hearts of the people nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard that the reason for this conflict was this boy. He is so young—how is his cultivation level so high?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I don’t know where this kid came from.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who cares? We are only here to watch a good show. It would be difficult for the two families to end this peacefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel like it's not going to be good for the Mo family and this kid. Don’t you all see? Even the Flowing Cloud Sect has sent people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you know? With no special circumstance, the Flowing Cloud Sect would not intervene. Didn’t you hear that that person is Xiao Yun’s senior brother? Stop talking and watch!” All sorts of talk echoed among the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the noise from the crowd, Xiao Yun let out a cold smile and walked forward a few steps. “I want to see what strength you have.” Then his aura changed and his spirit force fluctuations increased. From the look of his aura, he was at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xiao Yun’s arrogant words, Zhao Jiuge remained silent. He didn’t know if he was excited or nervous. Now that he had reached Spirit Transformation, he was eager to test his strength. He wanted to live life his way and take control of his life from the heavens. Ever since the day he met Ye Wuyou, he wanted to be in control of his own fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes were filled with excitement as he walked toward Xiao Yun. This time, he was going to let the Xiao family know the meaning of “strength is to be respected.” He was going to send that line back to Xiao Yi and use his actions to brutally smack the Xiao family in the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Xiao Yun, he also materialized his spirit force around him, and his clothes fluttered. An invisible aura spread out around him, making Mo Linger’s eyes turn into crescent shapes from smiling. On the day he had broken through to Spirit Transformation, he left the Mo mansion to practice controlling his spirit force in the mountains. There, he accidently found the true use of the Sanskrit Divine Body. This was why Zhao Jiuge was so confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he took the preemptive strike. The light blue longsword hummed as he injected spirit force into it. The sword moved and seven consecutive rays of sword light shot out, creating a sharp sound as they sliced through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Useless little tricks.” Xiao Yun’s words were filled with disdain, and he casually pulled out a magic treasure. It was a white sword. Seven equally dazzling white lights shot out, accurately targeting the blue lights flying toward him. They collided and disappeared into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me show you what it means for a firefly to compare itself to the bright moon. Come experience the power of the Flowing Yun Sword Technique of the Flowing Cloud Sect.” Xiao Yun’s face was filled with pride. After the first exchange of blows with Zhao Jiuge, Xiao Yun relaxed. After all, Zhao Jiuge was only at the early stage of Spirit Transformation, and Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force was not as strong as his. He also had the inheritance from the Flowing Cloud Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit force inside his body followed the route for the Flowing Cloud Sword and his hands swayed gently back and forth. The white sword turned into a meteor that shot toward Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Xiao Yun use the Flowing Cloud Sword, Zhao Jiuge licked his dried slips and felt a stinging pain in his body. The sword hadn't even arrived yet, but he could feel its sharpness. At the same time, he couldn’t help but feel envious. When would he find a suitable teacher and learn even more powerful attack spells?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He concentrated and his spirit force rushed into the blue longsword in his hand. As the white sword became larger in his eyes, he raised his hand to block it, but the meteor-like white sword suddenly split into many swords. They surged toward Zhao Jiuge like a stream of flowing clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge’s pupils suddenly shrank. He didn’t have much battle experience, and it was his first time experiencing something like this. He panicked slightly and swung his sword to block. However, he was shocked to find that after he swung his sword at the air, he felt searing pain coming from his body, as well as the faint smell of blood. Fortunately, he cultivated the Sanskrit Divine Body, or else that strike would have penetrated his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge let out a long breath and noticed a large wound on his body. It was still dripping blood. The meteor-like white sword that had stabbed Zhao Jiuge had flown back into Xiao Yun's hands. Seeing Zhao Jiuge’s gloomy face, Xiao Yun began to laugh arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the field, the people of the Mo family had heavy expressions. Only Mo Longjie was still calm; no one knew what he was thinking. Mo Linger’s eyes were filled with worry and even started to tear up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the crowd was a beautiful, young girl with sparkling eyes. “This piece of wood, he has a full mountain of treasure but doesn’t know how to use it,” she muttered in her crisp voice with a playful expression. It was the mysterious girl from outside the auction house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the taunting and debating of the surrounding crowd, Zhao Jiuge glanced at the worried gazes of the Mo family. He took a deep breath to endure the pain and began to cycle the Sanskrit Divine Body, the only thing he knew.</span></p>
