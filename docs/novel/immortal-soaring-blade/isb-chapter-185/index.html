 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

This was not only because he was shocked by that stunning performance, but also because Zhao Jiuge was like a dried-up oil lamp. Even if he won, it would be a tasteless victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly led Chen Gang and the other seven disciples into the center of the field. Then he stopped and looked profoundly at the other two figures. His expression became serious and he clasped his hands. “Sorry about this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, the aura around his body erupted and slowly increased, then a faint light appeared around him. Chen Gang and the other seven disciples did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling the aura spread out, Bai Qingqing’s expression changed a bit. However, it only changed slightly and she revealed no other emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stepped forward two steps and stood before Zhao Jiuge to protect him. A water-blue light slowly emerged from her body and her late stage Foundation Realm cultivation spread out to resist the pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Qingqing stepped past Zhao Jiuge, she whispered, “Take this moment to recover your spirit force with the pill, I’ll make my move first. Earlier, you went on a rampage; it's time for me to help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice was soft and lacked emotion, but Zhao Jiuge saw a strange light in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, Zhao Jiuge nodded. He didn’t refuse or waste time saying nonsense, because after knowing each other for so long, he knew that Bai Qingqing was someone with a plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the forest a few hundred meters away from the top of Wu Hua Peak, there were five figures hiding, four men and one woman. This was Mu Zijun’s group. This was a path leading up to the top. Earlier, when they saw the situation, they didn’t bother going up. They were going to let the people up there compete and borrow the other two peaks’ power to deal with Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been standing guard here, so when the disciples of the other two peaks passed by, they were dealt with. They had harvested more than 200 flags, and most of the disciples among the three peaks had been eliminated. However, Mu Zijun was confused about where Luo Xie’s group had gone. Without Zhao Jiuge and Leng Rufeng, they were nothing but a handful of loose sand. He originally wanted to teach them a lesson, but he couldn’t find them. Instead, they had waited here, playing the fisherman, and it was quite comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Zhao Jiuge was going to fight the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak, Mu Zijun smiled at Zhao Jiuge’s misfortune.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Zhao Jiuge, ah, Zhao Jiuge, no matter how well you can fight, you have just finished dealing with the disciples of the Mysterious Strange Peak. I don’t believe you can deal with the disciples of the Mysterious Fallen Peak. You’re so anxious to stand out, you deserve to be dealt with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Zimo and the youth with the scar looked at Zhao Jiuge with cold gazes, revealing the same sneer. Among the three of them, the youth with the scar undoubtedly hate Zhao Jiuge the most. He had been made a fool of before the person he loved and had been defeated by Zhao Jiuge in front of many. Bai Zimo had killing intent toward Zhao Jiuge, he just hadn’t found the chance to act. As for Mu Zijun, he had no deep hatred against Zhao Jiuge, he was just jealous that Zhao Jiuge had always robbed him of his limelight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Baiwan looked at Zhao Jiuge with a complicated gaze. Who would have thought that the youth he had drank together with would become like this today? He was already beginning to shine and was like a sun that would soon rise in the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Liu Yinger whose eyes shined while she stared at Zhao Jiuge. When Zhao Jiuge was battling earlier, he was simply too handsome. However, her worship-filled eyes also contained a bit of heartache. His blood-stained, blue sword robe could be seen even from a few hundred meters away, and she felt like she could smell the blood. However, no matter how much her emotions swayed, there was only a sense of loss in the end. This was because there was a cold woman as bright as the moon beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The delicate Liu Yinger took a deep breath, then her expression turned slightly bleak and she lowered her head. The falling flowers yearn for love, but the heartless brook ripples on. She stubbornly turned her head to avoid looking at the celestial-like couple, but she couldn’t help but worry about him and continued watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gust of wind blew by, causing the leaves to flutter and the grass to sway. Her heart was like the fluttering leaves that gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the battle on the top of Wu Hua Peak began. They watched like everyone else, expecting the Mysterious Heaven Peak to be defeated. However, what happened next shocked them greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to their number advantage, Luo Bowen’s morale was at its peak, but they didn’t take the lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Gang looked relaxed and was not as serious as when he observed the other peaks fighting. He seemed to believe that victory was certain for their Mysterious Fallen Peak. However, hidden inside that relaxed gaze was him coming up with a way to deal with Luo Bowen so he could become rank one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Qingqing’s next move quickly dispelled his and Luo Bowen’s thoughts that they had victory in the bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing’s aura continued to increase, and when it reached a certain point, everyone became surprised. In particular, the nine people facing her felt it most clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue sword robe was clinging to her body, but the edges of the robe fluttered in the wind. A few strands of her scattered hair also swayed to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beautiful eyes closed and her water-blue eyes became brighter and brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The atmosphere suddenly froze and even the light that was becoming brighter suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing suddenly opened her eyes, and there was a flash of light in them. At this moment, she silently muttered four words in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Blue Tide Rises.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing didn’t want to reveal her ace in the sect and expose her identity. Even though there was no danger in the sect if her identity was exposed, she didn’t want to cause unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as she got to know Zhao Jiuge better, her heart and thoughts subtly changed. This had allowed her to learn perseverance and other things from his hardworking young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever she saw that young man giving it his all, her heart was inexplicably touched. In particular, when he worked hard for those trash treasures and resources, she didn’t find him dislikable. Instead, his miser actions always made her laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, this young man had lost his Blue Plum Sword and his robe was dyed in blood, but he was still fighting desperately like a madman just to obtain a treasure she considered trash so he could increase his strength by a little. She couldn’t bear to disappoint this young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s why she had decided to use her father’s famous spell, The Blue Tide Rises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Luo Bowen and Chen Gang were careless because they had the numbers advantage, giving the time to activate the spell; she had been preparing the spell this whole time. Although her The Blue Tide Rises was only at the first stage, unlike her father’s, it was more than enough to deal with nine Foundation Realm cultivators.</span></p>

Her body began to tremble a little—she must have used a lot to cast this spell. After all, the more powerful the spell, the more spirit force it consumed.</span></p>

The blue spirit force surged into the sky and the sounds of waves crashing in the sky became even louder. More and more blue light gathered in the sky until a large mass shined brightly above everyone.</span></p>

She sighed in her heart. It was far from what her father could do. She could only achieve the first stage, but when her father used it, it could even cause the winds and clouds to move.</span></p>

Under the blue light in the sky, she gave off a never-before-seen sense of morbid beauty.</span></p>
