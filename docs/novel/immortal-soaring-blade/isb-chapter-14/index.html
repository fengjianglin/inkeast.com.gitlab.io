 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at the youth in the silver robe and cursed in his heart. This youth was already so vicious and vile at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth in the golden robe saw Xiao Yu close in on him and his little sister, so he quickly stepped forward to protect his little sister. He lifted his longsword before him to defend. Although he was facing Xiao Yu, who was one realm above him, at the Blood Movement Realm, he did not show fear, he was still like a stubborn, little lion cub. The little girl behind him was filled with worry, her black eyes showing signs of panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man entangled in the battle against Xiao Zhan was observing the situation this entire time and was caught off guard by Xiao Zhan, causing him to take a hit on his shoulder from the giant, blood-colored blade. The old man realized how dangerous the situation was and no longer held back. At the risk of exhausting his spirit force, rays of sword light began to appear. He could leave his old life here, but if the young master and lady were injured, how could he face the family head?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure of his spirit force spread out through the forest, causing leaves to rustle and fall from the sky. The sword light left marks on the ground, but Xiao Zhan kept the old man from disengaging. As the youth in the silver robe closed in, Zhao Jiuge couldn’t help but become worried. He had grown up with a kind heart, so after hesitating a bit, he clenched his teeth and rushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!” Zhao Jiuge rushed toward the fierce battle. When Xiao Yu heard the sudden sound, he was startled for a moment. He looked toward the source of the sound and saw a thin, young man wearing black. The young man’s clothes were somewhat worn out and he was holding a common hunting knife. This young man’s face was filled with anger from the injustice he had witnessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scram!” Looking at Zhao Jiuge’s appearance, Xiao Yu was too lazy to even show disdain. He didn’t even understand how this youth had come out of the mountain, but the spirit force fluctuations coming from Zhao Jiuge did shock him slightly. However, it was only slightly, as with his family’s position in the city, he wouldn’t even bother with someone dressed like Zhao Jiuge. The sword in his hand shined brighter as he swung it toward the young master and lady of the Mo family to kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge saw how the other party had ignored him due to his clothes and had gone for the killing blow. He couldn't help but lament how arrogant this youth was, and following that, he felt rage. He injected his own spirit force into his hunting knife and then arrived before the Mo family’s young master and lady in a flash. He waved his hunting knife toward Xiao Yu’s blue sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yu hadn’t expected this punk to actually act. Although he felt Zhao Jiuge’s spirit force fluctuations, given that he had a magic treasure, he simply injected more spirit force as he swung his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a loud crack, Zhao Jiuge’s hunting knife was cut in half and he retreated a few steps. His expression sank and rage filled his eyes. Even with his late stage Blood Movement Realm spirit force, he could not suppress Xiao Yu, and even the hunting knife that had accompanied him for so long had been broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yu only retreated one step. “Haha, you want to help when you’re this weak?” Xiao Yu looked at Zhao Jiuge’s sorry appearance and couldn’t help but laugh arrogantly. He didn’t hide the sarcasm or disdain in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the young master in the golden robe saw Xiao Yu’s arrogant appearance, his breathing became rough. Then he looked at the young man who had suddenly appeared before him filled with curiosity. Then his white hand handed the longsword in his hand to Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge looked at the longsword that was handed to him. The sword was flashing due to the spirit force and there was a piece of spirit stone on the handle. The fluctuations of spirit force spread across the sword, giving off a cool feeling in his hand. He carefully looked at this longsword. It was the lowest grade of magical treasures, a magic treasure, but he instantly fell in love with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the magic treasure sword in his hand, he turned to face the arrogant Xiao Yu and the corner of his mouth curved upward. Although he can’t release his spirit force into the surroundings like people at the Spirit Transformation Realm, with his late stage Blood Movement Realm cultivation, he could easily bully this friendly-looking yet vicious youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Yu looked at Zhao Jiuge, whose aura suddenly changed with the magic treasure in hand. The disdain in his eyes slowly faded as his brows furrowed and he became very serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge felt the powerful spirit force in his body and the fluctuations from the longsword before he moved. A milky-white light appeared around the sword. He didn’t use a fancy technique, he just charged at Xiao Yu. Xiao Yu’s eyes slowly widened as he felt that the spirit force from Zhao Jiuge was stronger than his own. At first, he didn’t think he would have to take Zhao Jiuge seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw Zhao Jiuge close in, so he raised his sword and channeled his spirit force into his blade. He struck three times, and after three bangs, Xiao Yu was forced back three steps. Beads of sweat appeared on his handsome face and his right hand was numb from the collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Zhao Jiuge didn’t have any experience in battling, he did have experience in hunting, so he knew to not give Xiao Yu a chance to recover. He raised his sword and continued to chop down on Xiao Yu several times. Xiao Yu only blocked one blow before Zhao Jiuge’s sword slashed down on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two strikes directly landed on Xiao Yu. One landed on Xiao Yu’s silver robe, slicing across his chest. Blood slowly seeped out, but the wound was not deep. The second strike hit his shoulder and was deep enough to expose his bones. Xiao Yu’s handsome face was filled with pain and blood slowly flowed out of the corner of his mouth. His whole body was trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhao Jiuge saw how miserable Xiao Yu looked, he began to hesitate. He didn’t know whether he should move in for the kill. Although Xiao Yu was vicious, he could not just kill Xiao Yu. While he had hunted and killed animals before, a person was different from an animal. Zhao Jiuge still could not go through with it. That night, when he killed Wang Dazhuang, he was blinded by rage. Although he was kind, he would not allow himself to be bullied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Zhao Jiuge hesitated, the five guards immediately rushed forward. Anger surged in Zhao Jiuge’s eyes once more as his left hand grabbed the blue sword in Xiao Yu’s hand and his right foot landed a sharp kick on Xiao Yu’s stomach. Xiao Yu flew a few meters backwards and his already injured body crumbled. Fortunately, two of the guards arrived in time to catch him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining three guards rushed over, but Zhao Jiuge waved his swords three times, and the sound of friction echoed in the air. The three guards were merely at the Spirit Detecting Realm—how could they compare to someone at the Blood Movement Realm? In an instant, the three guards each gained a wound more than ⅓ of a meter long and their suits of armor were dyed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Zhao Jiuge hated these people who bullied the weak, he did not kill; he only dealt heavy injuries. Xiao Zhan and the old man were in a fierce battle, but both of them were paying attention to the situation here. When Xiao Zhan saw Xiao Yu’s serious injuries, he was no longer in the mood to fight. He allowed the old man to leave a few wounds on his body and retreated to Xiao Yu’s side to check on his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Considering the fact that his family’s young master and lady were still here, the old man didn’t continue. He was afraid of Xiao Zhan going crazy. Xiao Zhan saw that although Xiao Yu’s injuries were serious, they were not life-threatening, so he relaxed. Then he turned angrily to the fierce Zhao Jiuge. “Very good, boy, and you too, Mo family. Just you all wait. This is not over!” He carried Xiao Yu and left with the guards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Xiao Zhan’s words, Zhao Jiuge felt annoyed that he had already attracted trouble, but was not very afraid of Xiao Zhan. Although the other party was at the mid stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, he was not afraid, because he could rely on the Sanskrit Divine Body. As the old man watched Xiao Zhan leave, he felt relieved. When he saw Xiao Yu move toward the young master and lady, it had scared him to the point of being covered in cold sweat. He was afraid something would happen to them. As for Xiao Zhan’s threat, he cared even less. Although the Xiao family’s eldest son had entered the Flowing Cloud Sect, the Mo family had their own backing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jiuge returned the longsword to the golden-robed young man and then carefully observed the blue longsword he had taken from Xiao Yu. He noticed that the spirit stone in this sword was even stronger and that the blade shined under the sun. He was very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the young girl wearing the yellow dress looked at the heroic young man that had suddenly appeared, her panicked expression changed to one of worship. She rushed up and hugged Zhao Jiuge’s right arm while shouting, “Young hero, you are really strong, even stronger than my big brother!” All of sudden, Zhao Jiuge became embarrassed. He felt something soft against his arm, and this made him even more shy.</span></p>
