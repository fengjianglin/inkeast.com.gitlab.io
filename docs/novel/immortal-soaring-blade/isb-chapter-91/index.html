 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mysterious Heaven Temple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was located at the highest point of the Mysterious Heaven Peak. It was shrouded in a sea of clouds year-round. Through the gently floating clouds, a majestic building made of red walls and glazed tiles could vaguely be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the wind blew, the cotton-like sea of clouds would churn from the bottom up. It was like a wave surging in the ocean. When the sun shined on the sea of clouds, the Mysterious Heaven Temple was like an immortal palace that stood high above others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-walled and glazed-tiled buildings surrounded the one in the middle that stood out, overwhelming everything else. The large hall had three floors, and each floor extended out, with large, cinnabar beads at the corners. Occasionally, a few white cranes flew by, giving this hall a sense of otherworldliness, as if it came from another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, inside the hall, there were three people sitting on ironwood chairs with red flowers carved on their backs. Behind them was a giant portrait of a scholar in green with a flying sword on his back. He was elegant and was sitting slanted on a blue bull. His eyes were slightly closed, as if he was thinking of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If you looked carefully, you would find that there were a few words on the lower right corner of the exquisite and charming portrait.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Comprehending the sword while riding a bull portrait.”</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This portrait was none other than the founder of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, Old Man Mysterious Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of the three people sitting in the hall, the person on the left was wearing a black robe and exuded a sorrowful aura. His face was expressionless and he looked to be in a bit of a daze. His whole body was covered in black clothes. This was Mysterious Heaven Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one on the right was wearing a white robe and even his black hair was wrapped in an ordinary white cloth. He gave off a clean and pure aura. His face was very beautiful and he had a pair of phoenix eyes. He looked a lot like the painting of a beautiful woman. However, the Adam's apple on his throat gave away his gender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you guys see through the spell that the little fellow used?” A gentle voice suddenly came from the youth wearing the purple shirt in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth in purple looked immature, but his eyes were filled with age. Those eyes were not something a youth could have. Only years of baptism by time could create such eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth in purple had red lips and white eyes, and his ancient eyes were watching the fight at the Mysterious Heaven Peak square with interest. There was an ordinary-looking wooden hairpin in his hair that was indistinguishable from ordinary wood. The aura he gave off was that of a normal person, but the smile he had when he asked the question made people feel like they were bathing in a spring breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who else could suppress the Mysterious Heaven Asura, Jian Wuxie, but the head teacher of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, Jian Wuxin. The youth in purple was Jian Wuxin, the 11th head teacher of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. The handsome and beautiful man in the white robe beside him was his junior brother, Jian Wuxuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For many years, the three peaks had been dominated by the Mysterious Heaven Peak. Most of the head teachers came from the Mysterious Heaven Peak, and even the Mysterious Heaven Temple was on the Mysterious Heaven Peak. The three of them were usually in closed-door cultivation, but because this was the recruitment that happened every 10 years, they had all come out to watch. These youths were the fresh blood of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. What made a sect powerful was not its background or its magical treasures. What determined the power of a sect was its fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the younger generation, no matter how powerful the sect’s holy land was or how many powerful senior cultivators they had, they wouldn’t last. They could only wait for their decline and eventual destruction. The current Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect was facing this problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his senior brother’s question, Jian Wuxuan gently shook his head with doubt on his face. His handsome brow furrowed and he softly said, “It’s the first time I have seen such a mysterious spell in many years. When the little fellow used that spell, his whole being became sacred and peaceful. Although his cultivation level right now is too low to release any great power, I really wonder what kind of power this little fellow can release with that mysterious spell once he reaches Nascent Soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jian Wuxin nonchalantly smiled and continued to wait for the battle with an interested expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it have been spread from the Nameless Temple? A spell that contains Sanskrit chants and petals and light is obviously a buddhist spell. The Nameless Temple is the most powerful buddhist power,” the dazed Jian Wuxie suddenly said, but his expression was gloomy. It was unknown what he had remembered, and his words were still as cold as they were on the day of the recruitment. Even when facing his own senior brothers, it was the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, the man in the white robe said, “Probably not.” His eyes narrowed and he continued to observe this mysterious little fellow with his divine sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, that little fellow is a disciple of my Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect. Most importantly, that child is pretty good. Regardless of his disposition or conduct, I like him,” the youth in purple gently said. His voice contained a certain charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like neither Jian Wuxie nor Jian Wuxuan had expected to hear a compliment from the head teacher, who rarely complimented people. Most importantly, the person he had complimented was just a little fellow that hadn’t even really begun cultivating. They were both surprised and looked at each other with doubt in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next moment, the Mysterious Heaven Asura Jian Wuxie returned to this dazed expression. However, Jian Wuxuan’s right brow rose and he had a questioning look on his face. “Oh? Did Senior Brother want to accept this little fellow as his disciple?” He seemed to be full of concern about his senior brother accepting a disciple. He stared unblinkingly at Jian Wuxin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to feel guilty from the stare of his junior brother and patiently explained, “No. Besides, there are three more years. Also, that little girl Sha Sha alone is giving me a headache. Where can I find the energy to accept another disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Jian Wuxin finished speaking, he suddenly regretted it and then timidly looked at the white-robed Jian Wuxuan. Sure enough, Jian Wuxuan’s expression became ugly and his brows were wrinkled as deep as they could go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, you still dare to talk about Sha Sha? You have to fight me for a disciple. You already have five disciples and you still have to steal from me when I have none.” When the handsome Jian Wuxuan became angry, there was a special type of flavor to it. That vicious look had no killing intent at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jian Wuxin let out an awkward laugh and quickly changed the subject as he didn’t want to continue discussing this. “That little girl Sha Sha has only been in the sect for a short period of time, but her cultivation has almost caught up to number three, Wu Tianshan. She is just too naughty, always giving me terrible headaches and causing trouble everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jian Wuxin had a smile on his face. Although it sounded like he was complaining, in his heart, he loved the girl named Sha Sha. She was extremely talented and was the youngest among his six disciples. Not only was she young, but her talent with the sword even amazed Jian Wuxin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the conversion between the two, the Mysterious Heaven Asura, who was standing there in his black robe, suddenly felt a bit bored. Without even saying goodbye, he drifted away and disappeared in the blink of an eye. As for the battle on the square, the victor would be decided after this move. Without looking, he already knew who had won. The Mysterious Heaven Asura had nothing to do and suddenly found his two senior brothers’ words to be dull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the Mysterious Heaven Asura drift away, the originally smiling Jian Wuxin let out a sigh. His sigh drifted across the wide hall and slowly echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white-robed man, Jian Wuxuan, frowned and worriedly said, “Junior Brother’s temperament has become more and more strange in recent years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is not his fault. Throughout all these years, he has given a lot to the sect. If it wasn’t for that thing, he wouldn’t have become like this. In three years, when it's time for the outer sect disciples to enter the inner set, let him accept a disciple to patiently teach in order to prevent him from doing nothing every day. He either spends his time in closed-door cultivation or is in a daze, living in the memories of the past.” Jian Wuxin had a complicated expression on his face. His heart ached for this junior brother of his. No matter how much he tried to talk to him, his junior brother wouldn't listen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fight on the Mysterious Heaven Peak square continued. No one could’ve imagined that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect’s head teacher, Jian Wuxin, was quietly observing this fight with his divine sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the platform, the tornado formed by the wind and frost was about to surround the two golden dragons. The wind and frost formed by the violent spirit force made everything blurry and blocked everyone’s vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thunderous rumble echoed and then a white light flashed like the most brilliant moment of a firework. Then a mushroom cloud entered people’s vision. When the shockwave and wind and frost disappeared, as well as the spirit force fluctuations, everyone finally got a good look at the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They saw Zhao Jiuge, whose hair was now scattered because the black cloth he had used to tie it had fallen off. His face was pale with a hint of red and he was staring viciously at the other side. His body seemed weak and wobbly, but his spine proudly remained straight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dozens of meters opposite of Zhao Jiuge, the youth with the scar had fallen to the ground like a dead dog. His weak breathing proved that he was still alive and not dead. The clothes on his body were in tatters and the blood spots that stained his robe were like countless blooming plum blossoms painted on a white scroll. It was a dazzling sight.</span></p>
