 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sharp sword energy cut directly into the golden dragon. The sword energy dissipated and the golden dragon only paused slightly before it continued onward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, if one took a closer look, the golden dragon’s eyes had obviously dimmed a bit. It looked like the ray of sword energy from Mu Zijun had managed to damage it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, the golden dragon smashed into Mu Zijun’s body. Even though he had released his spirit force to protect his body, he couldn’t help but tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spirit force armor around his body flickered and let out a constant hum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The roar of the dragon continued to echo and soon, a crisp sound echoed. Cracks began to appear on the spirit force armor. Then, with a bang, the layer of spirit force armor shattered into specks of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weakened golden dragon let out a roar and smashed into Mu Zijun’s body. There was shock in his eyes, and he quickly raised his flying sword to slash at the golden dragon. However, the golden dragon was made of spirit force, so it could only be stopped with spirit force. The sword slashed into nothing and the golden dragon slammed into Mu Zijun’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when the golden dragon was going to touch Mu Zijun’s body, there was a flash of light from the jade token on his waist. The light was going to surround Mu Zijun’s body, but it was too late and the golden dragon still hit his body directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An unstoppable impact shrouded Mu Zijun’s body. Fortunately, in the midst of this crisis, the jade token on his waist had absorbed part of the impact of the golden dragon. In the end, his blue sword robe was completely torn and his internal blood flow was a mess. His injuries weren't too great and he was able to block this dangerous attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he felt his entire body go numb and his meridians were damaged. The use of his spirit force was hindered. This caused Mu Zijun, who was in the middle of a battle, to frown. His expression turned a bit ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Bai Zimo’s side, the situation was not very good. He had firmly surrounded himself with spirit force to resist the golden dragon. However, having reached the Foundation Realm, Zhao Jiuge’s golden dragons were much more powerful than before, and they could not be resisted so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the golden dragon collided with the spirit force armor around Bai Zimo, the armor didn’t last for long before shattering. The golden dragon turned and its tail lashed into Bai Zimo, forcing him a few steps back. The dragon tail had hit his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the intense pain, his face turned red and he tightly bit his lip. Although he wasn’t bleeding, the spirit force inside his body had stopped due to the shock. Although his cultivation level was lower than Mu Zijun’s, he firmly protected himself and had the spirit treasure-grade sword, so he only felt his body go numb. His internal aura was a mess, but like Mu Zijun, he hadn’t suffered too much damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them looked toward the youth with the scar, they were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar had the jade mirror, which had released the yellowish-white light that had shrouded the golden dragon. However, the golden dragon was not reflected like he expected and instead directly passed through the yellowish-white light. It sent the youth with the scar flying without any effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth with the scar was pale because his spirit force had been drained completely from using his spirit treasure, so he didn’t have any strength to resist this ferocious blow. The youth with the scar was still confused; he didn’t understand why the jade mirror had suddenly failed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was still confused, the golden dragon shrouded him and directly sent him flying. His blue sword robe was torn into pieces and he was bleeding from his orifices. Blood flowed like water, and from the looks of it, if he wasn’t treated right away, it would endanger his future cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the Enforcement Hall disciples who were keeping an eye on the fight quickly surrounded him in spirit force to stop the bleeding. Then he was fed an unknown pill and was taken to some place to be treated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This scene seemed very similar to the battle between the youth with the scar and Zhao Jiuge in the past. The youth with the scar had been seriously injured by Zhao Jiuge’s attack and was then taken away by the instructor for treatment. He had spent half a year recovering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The poor youth with the scar didn’t even know what had happened and was once again defeated. He was sent to be treated once more and would likely have to spend another half-year to recover. The grudge between them had deepened even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that the golden dragon was something Zhao Jiuge had condensed inside his body and that what appeared was merely just a projection. No matter how powerful the jade mirror was, it wouldn’t be able to reflect the golden dragon. He couldn’t be blamed for this, he was just unfortunate to be facing off against Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those that knew the grievances between the two of them and knew about the battle before were all laughing so hard, they could hardly breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After using this ace, the 30% of spirit force Zhao Jiuge had recovered from the pill was completely used up. His body became unstable and his face was abnormally white. From the looks of it, he no longer had any power left to fight. Not only was his spirit force used up, even his roots were damaged. He would need to recuperate for a while to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing like this, Mu Zijun laughed even though he couldn’t move his body right now. He wanted to see how those two would reverse the situation. Even though he and Bai Zimo were injured, they at least still had the power to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, before he could smile, he suddenly saw more than a dozen rays of spirit force fly toward him and Bai Zimo. Anger surged in his heart and his mood dropped drastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It turned out that when Zhao Jiuge stepped forward, he had secretly ordered Luo Xie to attack with the remaining people once he finished his attack, regardless of the result. Thus, everyone sent out their attacks and his move had played its role.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pain and numbness in his body made it so he couldn’t use spirit force. Otherwise, why would he fear these attacks from the Spirit Transformation Realm bumpkins?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Zimo’s expression was as ugly as Mu Zijun’s. He was facing a similar situation. Both of them quickly thought about how they were going to resolve this critical situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even if they used protection treasures, it would be useless as even treasures required spirit force to use. They were still injured and hadn't recovered yet, so how could they use their spirit force?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the more than a dozen of spirit force attacks flying toward them, Mu Zijun and Bai Zimo couldn’t help but feel wronged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Zimo couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood when he saw those Spirit Transformation Realm attacks. Normally, he wouldn’t even bother looking at these bumpkins at the Spirit Transformation Realm, but today, he was defeated by them. He wanted to rip Zhao Jiuge apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was forced to withdraw. His injuries weren't serious, but he was eliminated from the training exercise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Zijun’s expression was gloomy and he gritted his teeth. He didn’t let out any sound, as he didn’t want to embarrass himself before all the disciples in the sect. However, he was helpless because he couldn’t use any spirit force; he could only watch them knock him down.</span></p>

His long, black hair was a mess and his blue sword robe was torn apart. Although his injury was not serious, it was undoubtedly a great shame for him. As he lied on the ground, he felt like he could feel the mocking gazes from all the disciples watching him. He could not accept this outcome.
