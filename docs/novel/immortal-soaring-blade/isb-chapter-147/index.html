 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qing raised her eyebrows and asked, “Do you think that I can’t deal with Han Songcheng. Are you being dismissive of me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Er Huzi was startled and raised his head. He didn’t think Bai Qingqing would ask him directly. He pondered for a few seconds. Having his thoughts pointed out made him a bit embarrassed, but he still stubbornly nodded. He slowly said, “Not dismissive, but I really don’t think you can deal with Han Songcheng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just when Zhao Jiuge thought Bai Qingqing was going to lose her temper again, she instead gently nodded. “Tomorrow, I’ll bring you Han Songcheng’s head. Tell me then if you think I have the strength to deal with him.” After saying that, she left and continued walking into the village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Er Huzi and Big Bear were completely shocked. They didn’t expect this beautiful young girl to say such shocking things. Only the old village chief remained calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then Er Huzi muttered, “That old Daoist was very strong, but he still died to that piece of dog shit Han Songcheng.” Then he pouted as if he remembered something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his voice was soft, Zhao Jiuge still heard this. Zhao Jiuge didn’t have any impression of Daoists. When he heard Er Huzi mutter, he asked, “What Daoist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, it was the old village chief who answered first. “In the nearby mountains, there used to be a small temple with an old Daoist and two disciples. In the previous years, the old Daoist would stay in the temple and occasionally come down to the nearby villages to help those that were seriously ill or encountered strange things. We were all very grateful to him. Then, after Han Songcheng arrived, everything changed. All of Han Songcheng’s evil-doings angered the old Daoist and the two of them had a big battle. It ended in a draw, and after that, Han Songcheng quieted down a lot. Then Han Songcheng suddenly reappeared this year and cruelly killed the old Daoist and his two disciples. In the last few months, without anyone keeping him in check, he has done as he wished and began acting against us. He knows immortal spells, so what can we do? I heard that a lot of people have died in the other villages.” After he finished speaking, the old village chief let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Village Chief, rest assured, he won’t be able to do as he wishes for long.” Zhao Jiuge comforted the old village chief. He secretly guessed that the old Daoist was a cultivator too and was at the same cultivation level as Han Songcheng at first . Then Han Songcheng had a breakthrough and the old Daoist was killed. What Zhao Jiuge found strange was that the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect had not acted after Han Songcheng did all these evil things. After all, this area was still within the control of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhao Jiuge didn’t know that Han Songcheng had never done much before and his cultivation was too weak. It was only after he killed the old Daoist that he began killing and robbing the mortals here. Then he was found by the Enforcement Hall of the Mysterious Heaven Sword Sect, who handed it over to the Duty Hall to give out as a mission. Han Songcheng had only begun terrifying these villages two months ago. Otherwise, given how he indiscriminately killed innocent people the disciples of the Enforcement Hall would have long dealt with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cultivators hated the killing of innocent mortals the most. This Han Songcheng had done all sorts of evil. Not only was he bullying those with weaker cultivation, he was now raping and plundering mortals. Naturally, those on the righteous path would not let him remain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope that’s the case.” The old village chief’s voice was uncertain. Right now, his only hopes rested on the shoulders of this young man and young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They turned a corner and arrived at the old village chief’s home. This house was simple, but it had its own charm. The entrance was fenced off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just after the several people entered, the young woman inside the living room heard the sound and immediately walked out. She saw the faces of the people that had entered the yard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dad, what’s going on? I heard from Auntie Wang that those people are coming?” Her voice was filled with anxiety. Zhao Jiuge turned to see the voice come from a woman around 20 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman was wearing a blue-grey skirt and her black hair was coiled up by a hairpin. Her skin was the color of wheat and there was a hint of anxiety on her face. When she spoke, her eyes shined with intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s alright, it was a misunderstanding. These two are immortal experts who came here under the order of their sect to deal with those pieces of dog shit. They will stay here for the night.” The old village chief pointed toward Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing this, the young woman was shocked and happy. She was shocked that two immortal experts would come to their home and happy that she would no longer have to be afraid. She had to live a life filled with fear recently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my youngest daughter, Cai Na.” The old village chief pointed at his youngest daughter and introduced her to Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing look at her, Cai Na somewhat embarrassingly lowered her head. She smiled and said, “Dad, you guys chat first, I’ll go make room for the two immortal experts.” Perhaps because she hadn’t had many interactions with strangers, she became nervous when she suddenly saw two extraordinary strangers. She used the excuse of cleaning the room to temporarily leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old village chief, Zhao Jiuge, and Bai Qingqing sat on the bench with Big Bear standing behind the old village chief. Er Huzi was still a bit depressed and was crouched at the entrance of the house, listening to them talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief conversation, there was a moment of silence where no one in the room spoke. Many thoughts flashed through the old village chief’s mind. Finally, he looked at the two young yet extraordinary youngsters. He was a bit uncertain as he said, “Are you sure you will go find Han Songcheng tomorrow? He also knows immortal spells, even the old Daoist that had cultivated here for many years was killed by him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge smiled and said, “We came here to deal with him. As for the rest, Elder, you don’t have to worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After almost two years of cultivation, Zhao Jiuge’s entire temperament had changed as well. He had calmed down a lot compared to when he was just a boy from the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old village chief didn’t know that the power of a cultivator was never determined by age. Some people could cultivate for a lifetime but never form their Spirit Core due to lack of talent. Others with talent and good cultivation methods could reach much further in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were young, they weren’t ordinary. One had good talent and a deep family background. The other had average talent but the diligence to make up for it. Zhao Jiuge was no longer the same as when he first entered the path of cultivation. His dao heart had slowly become stronger as time passed, and his dao was the sword dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Zhao Jiuge like this, the old village chief nodded and didn’t say more. Not to mention he thought they could succeed as well. “Since that’s the case, rest well tonight. Tomorrow, I’ll ask someone to take you to find him. Although we don’t know exactly where he is, we at least know which mountain peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Big Bear, who was behind the old village chief, suddenly stepped forward. His face had a complicated expression as he said to Zhao Jiuge, “As long as you two are sure you can get rid of that piece of dog shit, I’ll take you there tomorrow. At most, I’ll give up this life of mine, but it will be worth it as long as you two clean up that scourge.” His voice was filled with determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Er Huzi, who was unhappily squatting at the doorway, suddenly looked up at Big Bear. His face was filled with anxiety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine, you guys can’t help with the situation. Go do what you need to do, rest assured.” Zhao Jiuge waved his hand.</span></p>

Big Bear and Er Huzi still wanted to say something, but they were stopped by the old village chief.</span></p>

Let’s see if Cai Na has cleaned the room for you two.</span></p>

In particular, when she heard that the two youths were here to deal with that piece of dog shit Han Songcheng, she was extra attentive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing and Zhao Jiuge were alone in a room together, which was especially awkward, given how quiet the night was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the room was simple, it was very organized and comfortable after Cai Na cleaned it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a wooden table that was creaking and a small, yellow, wooden chair in a room with walls made of mud, along with a wooden bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Qingqing casually sat at the edge of the wooden bed. Zhao Jiuge somewhat awkwardly sat down on the yellow, wooden chair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because Bai Qingqing had noticed Zhao Jiuge’s awkwardness, she wanted to laugh, but she held back. She put on a serious face and said, “Come here and cultivate and get a good rest. Tomorrow won’t be so relaxed. After all, a battle can end in an instant.” Afterward, she ignored Zhao Jiuge and moved to the center of the wooden bed. She closed her eyes and began to cultivate to recover her spirit force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge’s expression changed to shock. After seeing that Bai Qingqing didn’t seem to mind, he slowly stepped forward and nervously climbed onto the bed. He sat down but didn’t forget to glance at Bai Qingqing. Seeing Bai Qingqing not reacting, Zhao Jiuge let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Zhao Jiuge was not in the mood to cultivate. He lowered his head and looked around the room. He couldn’t help but think of the time he spent in that village with Su Su. They were mistaken for a young couple. Thinking about this made Zhao Jiuge smile. He wondered how that girl Su Su was doing. Thinking about Su Su’s teary face when they parted, Zhao Jiuge felt his insides churn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was recalling the past, Bai Qingqing secretly opened her eyes just a slit to observe Zhao Jiuge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the young man she had known for a while make such an expression shocked her. What was he thinking about to make him reveal that charming smile?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge was in a daze for an unknown amount of time before he regained his senses. There were still important things to do tomorrow—they were going to find Han Songcheng and fight for real. Zhao Jiuge quickly began to cultivate his spirit force. This was, after all, a real battle, so he couldn’t help but be nervous and excited. He also had a hint of expectation in his heart. He was looking forward to how he would face off against others with his new strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge focused on the Sanskrit Heart Sutra and began absorbing spiritual energy. He checked the situation inside his dantian and let out a sigh of relief. The two golden dragons had mostly recovered, which made Zhao Jiuge feel more at ease. This made him feel more confident in the fight against Han Songcheng. He thought about condensing the third golden dragon since he still had over 1,000 spirit stones. However, thinking about it, if he got into any kind of accident, it would delay the situation, so he gave up on the idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Jiuge gradually entered into the state of cultivation, and his breathing became stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the sun shined the next day, Zhao Jiuge and Bai Qingqing were awakened by the noise outside. They opened their eyes and looked at each other.</span></p>
