 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Kurdak's Worry</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c153d4ab-7fff-a993-1a52-cc628fe91173"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lass!" Kurdak yelled in the camp. Even though he was now a commander with five thousand subordinates, he didn't look all that different from the slovenly mercenary he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But since the formation of his independent combat unit after the battle of Seatide, he was no longer the sole officer there. Blackie, Londo and Eibron had also been promoted from lieutenants to captains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said to be a coincidence. If a normal soldier was made to be Kurdak's subordinate, he would no doubt be filled with complaints about the whole thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only thugs like Blackie and Londo could deal with him, and they even saw him as the most thuggish of them all. Even though the others call him commander and captain, they had personally thought of him as their boss. Even if they weren't at war, they would go around collecting protection fee for him if he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's the deal with the ruckus so early in the morning?" Vera looked sleepy and annoyed. While she would carry out his orders during wartime as his adjutant, when they weren't fighting, she was on the top of the food chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come in with me," Kurdak said with two black eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What are you doing?" A hint of wariness flashed across her eyes. Even though the two of them were in really close terms, she wouldn't be okay with him getting it on with her first thing in the morning inside the camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She happened to notice Blackie and a few other soldiers' lewd smiles at her, which only served to infuriate her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey! What else can I do in this weather?" Kurdak said with an accused look, "Come in with me! It's not like we haven't done this before."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kurdak, if you dare to pull me one more time I'll bite your ears off!" She shot a glare at the others and scared them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the time Kurdak was inside the tent, Vera stomped on the ground impatiently. "Out with it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I gave it some thought last night and still can't figure it out," he said as he hurriedly poured her a cup of hot tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's this about?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Have you heard of what happened to Fort Kesta?" Kurdak asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's right. But isn't Eirinn safe?" When she first heard about the attack, she was at the brink of panic. Had Kurdak not stopped her, she would've took a few men with her to seek Eirinn out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, Lisana was sharp enough to notice that there would be others worried for her safety, so she wrote them letters after the rescue to notify them Eirinn was safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kurdak had received word about it through the military and Grandmaster Myr received Annelotte's in her place. Myr believed that since Eirinn was safe, there was no need to tell Annelotte about it so as to not disrupt her research.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, the letter that came later seemed a little urgent, so Myr thought it best to have Annelotte stop her research to go south. He wasn't too sure of the relationship between Annelotte and Eirinn, after all, and it wouldn't do for an old fellow like him to meddle too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That seems to be the case... But let me ask you this. Don't you think it's weird Ley's bureau wasn't able to detect the movement of 15 thousand troops?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It should be impossible."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's it. So I kept thinking all day yesterday and figured this had something to do with the bureau itself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you saying there's a spy inside?" she asked hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I believe it's possible that Arikos and someone else are trying to get Ley."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why would that be the case?" She furrowed her brow in puzzlement, "Ley's also a member of Moonshadow. Why would Arikos want to harm him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's the least you can expect people from that guild to do," Kurdak said with a cold humph, "Don't forget that Moonshadow had never treated us properly ever since our search for the millennium snowlotus. I dare say they have a hand in most of our troubles! I don't trust them!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then... what do you think we can do now?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How would I know?" he said with a shrug, "I still can't tell what that old fox Wayerliss plans to do, to say no more of stopping them."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then why did you call for me?" She rolled her eyes at the seemingly pointless action. Were they to panic together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There is something we can do, though," he said after a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I want you to go to Eirinn," he said after some consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Out with it. What do you need me to do?" she asked solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"First, I need you to make sure how she's doing. Even though Lisana sent us a letter, she isn't too familiar with Eirinn, who I'm sure is in shock. I worry that she'll fare worse if nobody she knows if there with her."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What else?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Second, I need you to stop Ley."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I will." She knew what he meant by that. Given Leguna's rashness, it was almost certain that he'd do something reckless once Eirinn was put in danger, and who knew what he'd do in that state?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I only hope you'll be in time," Kurdak said with a worried look. Even though he heard Leguna had gone to the northern highlands, he wasn't sure whether he was back. If Leguna went to Fort Kesta himself, then sending Vera there would be pointless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"And finally..." Kurdak stuck out three fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'll go to Melindor myself and have a good talk with Annie?" Vera guessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lass, I've noticed you've been getting rather sharp lately!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But of course!" She managed to figure out what he wanted. Even though Leguna was the bureau head, he wasn't really the type to be part of all that scheming given his naivete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, the only person who could serve as his brains would be Annelotte. However, it was still possible Annelotte would be biased, given that she had grown up in Moonshadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason he wanted to send Vera there personally was because of how unreliable normal letters could be. It was exceedingly possible that the bureau would look through the letter, and if the contents were revealed to those in Moonshadow, who knew what they would do with the letter?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lass... Do you think Annie is.."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's impossible!" She didn't wait for him to finish and barked out like a female panther, glaring at Kurdak with eyes filled with rage and disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But she is..." he carefully tried to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Impossible!" she repeated, this time even more harshly. She pointed at Kurdak's nose and said with a strict, but not loud, voice, "Kurdak, let me warn you! I won't let you suspect Annie, not ever! She definitely isn't someone the guild planted to spy on Leguna! Not even Wayerliss can control her!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why do you think so?" He felt a little angered in response to Vera's wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why? She's Annelotte Ladis, the daughter of the galestorm swordsaint, and the woman I respect the most! Is that enough?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Can you not be so emotional? It's not something we can factor our personal feelings into."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't look down on personal feelings!" she shrieked as she patted her full bosom. "If Annie didn't act on her feelings, I would've died from Hladik's Death's Finger! You'll only be able to see my ashes if it hadn't been for her!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kurdak didn't really know what else to say. He knew that Annelotte had saved Vera before, but all he saw was her cold 'corpse', so it didn't really affect him much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera on the other hand watched as Hladik dictated the spell before Annelotte charged in to block it for her. The reason Kurdak saved Vera all those times was because he loved her, but Annelotte was actually willing to sacrifice her life for one she considered her most important friend!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no question that Vera respected her the most in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, she was incredibly touchy when it came to suspecting Annelotte. She calmed down and said, "You weren't there to see it for yourself. She didn't even have any magic barrier on and actually rushed to me, knowing that she'd die. That's why she isn't the person you say she is. I won't believe that even if I die."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He kept silent before bowing to her all of a sudden. "I'm sorry."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I shouldn't have suspected her," he raised his head and said, "but please forgive me. I was just too worried for Ley."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I only hope that you don't treat Annie like that in future," she said with a sigh and a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't ever let this happen again, I promise."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then all's good. Is there anything else?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nope."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then I better make my move soon. The sooner I reach, the sooner I'll be able to stop worrying." She waved goodbye to him and left the tent.</span></p>
