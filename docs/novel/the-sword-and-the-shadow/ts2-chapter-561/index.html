 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Eirinn's Incident</strong></p>
 <p>Leguna ignored everyone when he finished his proclamation. He focused his attention on the bashful Innilis instead.</p>
 <p>He found her to be really beautiful that night, even more so than Annelotte and Eirinn. Her petite face was completely red and seemed like an autumn persimmon. Her large eyes were filled with bashfulness and joy. While she felt a little awkward about having her relationship announced before everyone including the imperial princes, she still felt overwhelmed with happiness.</p>
 <p>Leguna stretched his hand out to give her face a little pinch. "So, satisfied?"</p>
 <p>"Big Bro you idiot! You actually announced something so embarrassing in front of everyone… Seriously…" She didn't dare to meet his gaze.</p>
 <p>"Seriously what?" He smiled and whispered by her ear, "Do you mean to say why I'm so thick-skinned?"</p>
 <p>"Idiot!" She gave him a light push, but anyone could tell what she really wanted was a hug.</p>
 <p>However, he didn't do just that. He smirked and said, "I've always been quite the fool. Nobody here likes me, as you can see."</p>
 <p>"Big Bro…" She sounded a little down as she understood how truly bad his reputation had become in the time she spent in the academy. At the very least, not a single boy in her class wouldn't furrow their brow upon mention of Leguna.</p>
 <p>He stroked her hair and said, "But I don't care. I only want to ask you what you care about. Are you willing to be someone respected by everyone, or the bad girl who only cares about whether I like you? You better think this through. You can't change your answer once you make your choice."</p>
 <p>She couldn't help but smile. She looked up and said with all the seriousness she could muster, "What choice is there to be made? I've already made up my mind a few years ago. Big Bro Leguna, no matter how you change or who leaves you, I never will. I already pledged to follow you wherever you go the first time I set foot on Chino. If you're the Dark Requiem everyone hates, so what if I become a bad girl?"</p>
 <p>"Hahahaha!" He laughed heartily and ignored the unfriendly gazes of the nobles and the other students. He lowered his head and looked at her. "You said it. Don't regret it."</p>
 <p>"I did many things that I regret over the past few years--" She turned to look at Annelotte, seeing her sitting there quietly without a hint of anger and jealousy, only mild encouragement. She took a deep breath and looked up. "--But this is the only thing I will never come to regret!"</p>
 <p>"Then…" He suddenly lowered his body and planted a kiss on her lips.</p>
 <p>Strictly speaking, it was her first. Leguna had shamelessly taken Annelotte and Eirinn's first kisses a few years ago. But he didn't touch Innilis in the slightest.</p>
 <p>It wasn't that he didn't feel any affection for her, but she was simply too young and innocent. Not to mention, with Eirinn and Annelotte constantly eyeing him, he made sure to stop the beast within from coming out even when he spent time alone with Innilis.</p>
 <p>He understood that it was something he should never do for her sake. Thankfully, he had the patience and wasn't a sick pervert, knowing that fruit too raw tasted sour rather than sweet. He patiently waited for the fruit to grow ripe before going in for it. That was why for the past few years, he only went for the other two ripe fruits he had around him.</p>
 <p>Now, this little watermelon called Innilis finally turned ripe for the picking.</p>
 <p>They kissed for a long minute before everyone else. In the end, Innilis couldn't stand the chatter any longer and pushed him away.</p>
 <p>"You're a meanie!" she said in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>"There's more mean things to come, you know!" he said.</p>
 <p>"Huh?" She looked up with her innocent little eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing how cute she was, he came to understand the true meaning of the word. However, he sadistically smirked and asked, "I wonder who said a few months ago she wants to break through to the mid-order with me? Well, you're already in the mid-order now… But we still have the high order and myth realm, right? Hehe… Looks like I'll be tiring myself out to make sure you improve at breakneck speed…"</p>
 <p>"Idiot!" She pummeled her little fists on his chest. "No wonder Sis Annie calls you a shameless thug!"</p>
 <p>"Haha! I'm just the kind of thug to be a match for you!" he said all of a sudden as he reached his hand to sweep her from her waist.</p>
 <p>She felt the lift and was startled. But when she saw the smile on his face, she calmed down.</p>
 <p>By the time she was aware of what was happening, she was now being princess carried by Leguna.</p>
 <p>"You came up here alone, but I won't let you get off alone. Let's go, madam wife?"</p>
 <p>"Okay…" Had her mind not been tempered over her time in school, she would've passed out right away from being hugged by him. Even so, she still felt rather dazed. Leguna carried her off the stage in front of everyone else.</p>
 <p>Sasha was still clapping as her tears and snot flowed out. It was too touching. Innilis's bliss gave her even more confidence and encouragement. She resolved herself to become as brave and strong as she was.</p>
 <p>Apart from Sasha, no other noble really gave her their blessings. They believed that she wouldn't live a happy life, considering the type of person Leguna was said to be. She truly had bad taste in men!</p>
 <p>"Congratulations, Innie," Annelotte said as she stood up.</p>
 <p>"Ah! Sis Annie!" She only just realized her situation and squirmed to get him to put her down. She was rather shy, after all, and felt really awkward letting Annelotte see her hugged like that.</p>
 <p>However, he didn't loosen his grip at all. He was as powerful as a high-order warrior, so there was no way she could struggle her way out.</p>
 <p>"Alright, you're the star today," Annelotte said with a smile as she stroked Innilis's head. "It's been hard for you over the past half year. So, you better get your fill today!"</p>
 <p>Innilis blushed even more and stopped her struggling. She plastered her head in Leguna's chest and said, "Thank you, Sis Annie."</p>
 <p>"It's what you deserve. It has nothing to do with me." She turned to Leguna. "I have other things at the academy to deal with, so I'll be taking my leave."</p>
 <p>"Oh, alright. Just tell me if you need any help."</p>
 <p>"No need. Your job is to spend time with Innie tonight." She left without turning back.</p>
 <p>"Big Bro… Is this a little unfair for Sis Annie?"</p>
 <p>Hearing that, he fell silent. "Well, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. But… since I'm a three-timing scum, things will inevitably be unfair anyway. Annie should understand that already. That's why she decided to give us some space."</p>
 <p>"Am I being too selfish?"</p>
 <p>"No, you aren't. If anyone's to blame, it'd be me! I'm the one who started all this!"</p>
 <p>The gloom in her eyes only deepened.</p>
 <p>"Alright, let's not mull over this. Tonight, we--"</p>
 <p>He had wanted to console her, but Xeno rushed over all of a sudden and whispered something to him. His expression turned grim immediately.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, Innie…" He put her down and killing intent exuded from him. "Looks like I have something to deal with tonight. Can you wait for me?"</p>
 <p>"Of course. But… what happened?" She knew that some things could wait. She just asked out of worry.</p>
 <p>Leguna pondered for a moment and decided to tell the truth. "Something happened to Eirinn."</p>
