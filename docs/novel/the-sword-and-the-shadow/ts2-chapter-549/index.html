 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-d3ea6b3a-7fff-f74f-0251-8b2438cdc08c"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were in a public setting, Leguna didn't put much force into his punch. Even so, the thump that sounded when it collided with Harrison's face caught the attention of a few others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a few steps back and touched his mouth with his left hand. There was a slight burning sensation and the salty taste in his mouth was beginning to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ptooey!" He spat out some blood and saliva before feigning an innocent look. "I wonder why you would hit me, Mister Leguna?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Cause you deserved it." He decided a simple explanation like that was best to prevent Eirinn from getting too agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Can I take this as a personal challenge?" His gaze turned cold. He knew that he had successfully angered Leguna, and it would soon be time for the beatdown session.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't be shameless enough to challenge worthless trash like you." He didn't want to escalate the matter, so he merely dropped that line coldly before attempting to leave with Eirinn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Harrison watched them leave before removing his leather glove. He looked at the witnesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I believe all of you saw that."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he spoke, he tossed the glove at the back of Eirinn's head as a formal challenge. He intentionally aimed for her as he knew it would be an even larger affront to him. That way, there was even less of a chance for his challenge to be refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ouch..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She scratched the back of her head. It didn't hurt to be struck by a leather glove, but it was quite disorienting. She turned back in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, my apologies. I got the wrong person. Please do forgive me." Harrison removed his other glove and threw it at her face this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leguna's eyes flashed the moment he saw it and immediately swerved to block it. He moved quickly at a speed that was hard for the eye to detect. The gloves were torn into countless small pieces by some unknown means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stretched his shadow impetus out from his hands and carefully manipulated them to draw the torn leather pieces into his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the fragments in his grasp, he looked at Harrison coldly. "Well, you want a duel, huh? I'll gladly oblige."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, looks like we have more exciting shows lined up tonight," Geoffrey's bright voice rang out. The nobles moved out of the way to make a path for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good evening, Your Highness." Harrison hurriedly bowed. His father was one of the lapdogs of Alfreid, the prime minister who had close ties with Geoffrey, so he was no doubt on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good evening, Harrison--" Geoffrey smiled and turned to Leguna, asking the obvious. "--What in the world is going on?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Nothing--" Harrison put on the most innocent look he could. "--I only wanted to invite the young lady to a dance, but Sir Leguna seemed to... Hehe..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's only a dance. Why do you have to be so uptight, Leguna?" Geoffrey said in the mediatory tone of an old gentleman, but even a fool could tell he was trying to speak in Harrison's favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Eirinn doesn't want to dance, and I won't let her dance with him."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I wonder if I may ask what relationship do you have with Miss Eirinn," Geoffrey said with a glint in his eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leguna was silenced by the sudden question. He knew how dangerous it was. If he didn't admit his relationship with her, he would hurt her. But if he did...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His tryst with Annelotte was common knowledge in the empire. If he admitted to being in a relationship with another woman, things might get more complicated. He spent a quiet moment weighing his options, then resolved himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"She's Eirinn, my fiancee."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sudden chatter amongst everyone in the room nearly shattered the windows. They whispered all sorts of things into each other's ears. But no matter what they said, Leguna could be sure it was nothing good about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Geoffrey had expected Leguna to say that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"She's only your fiancee. Don't you think you're a little too controlling? How about this? Since my imperial father isn't here yet, why don't you let me settle this matter? Let us have a simple duel with the usual rules. The winner can--"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I accept Harrison's duel, but I won't bet her on anything," he interrupted, "If I lose, I'll let him slap me. Isn't this what you want?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Geoffrey glanced at Harrison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Fine. But I have one condition."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's hear it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I don't want anyone to get unnecessarily hurt, so neither of you is allowed to use impetus," he suggested snidely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As someone who had more than a couple run-ins with Leguna, he knew how strong he was. While Harrison was a high-order warrior, he didn't stand a chance against him. But things were completely different without impetus. Harrison was a warrior. He focused on physical strength. Without his impetus to close and reverse the gap, Leguna was much weaker than him. It was doubly so in Leguna's case, since his strength was based almost entirely on his gifts, as was his fighting style. Without them, he was nothing more but a pesky boy slapping a tree with a branch and pretending to actually achieve something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Fine. But if I win, I get to slap both of you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Geoffrey hesitated. He had created as advantageous a position for Harrison as he thought possible under the circumstances, but he was far from certain of his victory. If he lost, they would both be humiliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you not dare?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Since they don't dare, why not let your subordinate fight on your behalf?" a man with a deep voice said as he approached Leguna from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leguna turned around with a shocked expression. He froze when he saw the man's face as if struck by lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew the names of every one of his agents, but he'd never seen this face or heard this voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was in his forties, and had Leguna's short black hair. His beard was messy, but Leguna could tell he had a very thin face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was most definitely not someone from the bureau.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><em>Who the hell is this?</em> he thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man, having apparently sensed his doubts, winked at him. His face was completely foreign, but Leguna felt intimately familiar with his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was especially captivated by the man's gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How about it, Sir?" the man asked, respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was quite the dilemma. He gazed at the man. His black eyes gazed back. The gaze tugged at the deepest parts of his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned to Geoffrey and Harrison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's fine if you're afraid of me, but I doubt you'd be afraid of a mere grunt from the bureau."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright then. Clean your face for me while you wait."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Harrison eyed the man and nodded. While the incident was quite different with the man and Geoffrey's interference, he didn't mind letting this continue so long as he got a chance to slap Leguna.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Eirinn...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He eyed the timid girl hiding behind Leguna and wondered how he would violate the dirty little, pure-feigning slut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Come with me. We'll go to a wider space," Geoffrey said, leaving his agreement unspoken but assumed, and led everyone to the dueling grounds.</span></p>
