 <p>"Ley, stay back. We are all here," Kurdak said.</p>
 <p>"Big Bro Leguna…" Eirinn and Innilis both called out.</p>
 <p>Leguna gripped his fists and grit his teeth as if he was thinking things through. Half a minute later, he opened his eyes, raised his hand and punched Eiron in the face.</p>
 <p>"Enough!"</p>
 <p>Eiron wasn't the least bit mad from the strike. He slowly stood up and looked at him. "You aren't willing? But weren't you enjoying the time with the Annelotte I simulated? I could tell that you were truly happy back then. Why do you reject it now?"</p>
 <p>"That's right, I knew that Annie was fake all along," he said, calming his anger, "But I had no choice but to numb myself and convince myself she was real. Otherwise, I would've perished from Njolvinr's will long ago."</p>
 <p>"Is what's real really that important?" Eiron changed form into another stranger. "Look. Even though I'm just a spell, I can make anything you want in this space. They are all tangible. You can see and feel them. Is it any different from the real thing?"</p>
 <p>"There is!"</p>
 <p>"How so?"</p>
 <p>"There are still two people waiting for me in reality. I admit that forgetting the real world and staying here can be a form of release for me. However, it's all too irresponsible. They might still be waiting for me in the real world. They might be suffering and need me to be by their side. I can't continue staying inside this dream."</p>
 <p>Eiron knew that he wouldn't be able to convince him otherwise. He probingly asked, "So, what are you going to do once you return to reality?"</p>
 <p>"I'll look for Eirinn and Innilis first, then kill dogs like Alissanda and Alfreid," he calmly said.</p>
 <p>Eiron sighed helplessly. "I believe you already understand the truth, right? Don't misuse Njolvinr's power."</p>
 <p>"You don't have to worry about that. My power is mine alone, and Njolvinr's is his." By then, the world around him began to contort and blur. It was a sign he was waking up in the real world.</p>
 <p>"Can you tell me how long has passed in the real world?" Leguna asked.</p>
 <p>"I'm not too sure either, but it definitely wasn't short. You should know when you wake up."</p>
 <p>"I see… It's been a while…"</p>
 <p>The whole time he was unconscious, his will was fighting Njolvinr's. He found out about Njolvinr's other identity at that time. He was the Lord of Shadow, the god that used to control the shadow realm. Once he found out about it, he understood Leybecca's true identity.</p>
 <p>Leybecca was a divine servant Njolvinr had created. She had served the Lord of Shadow for countless aeons. But some years ago, Njolvinr fell from grace for some reason. Leybecca, having lost her master, entered the material plane in hopes of finding him. After a few decades, she finally found the one who succeeded Njolvinr's power -- Nidhogg.</p>
 <p>Even though Njolvinr was the master of shadows, he was a true deity and his control over the four main elements was far above that of normal people. That was why his power was all-encompassing after he descended into the mortal realm, and it was also the reason Nidhogg had all six aspect gifts. However, when Leybecca tried to get into contact with Nidhogg, he had been killed by Marolyt and the other experts. Njolvinr's power thus split into six and was inherited by different people.</p>
 <p>Later, Leybecca finally found Leguna, who had inherited Njolvinr's core power of darkness. In the end, Annelotte's death unlocked the final key to Leguna's shadow power and woke Njolvinr's will up. They proceeded to clash in the dreamscape and Leguna finally obtained temporary victory just recently.</p>
 <p>Actually, Leguna was quite thankful for Eiron's help the whole time. Had he continued to suffer from the pain of losing Annelotte, he would've been eradicated by Njolvinr's will right away. It was precisely because the fake Annelotte was there to accompany him that brought him a trace of hope that served as the source of his motivation in his stubborn resistance against Njolvinr.</p>
 <p>Not long after, he realized that the Annelotte that accompanied him was merely a trick conjured up by Eiron. But as time passed, he had slowly walked out of his rut. Later, his motivation to fight Njolvinr shifted from the fake Annelotte to his desire of wanting to meet Eirinn and Innilis again, though, he couldn't let go of the blue-haired figure from his memories. He only had Njolvinr show his true form at the very end. Even though he knew it was fake, he wanted to see her face regardless.</p>
 <p>And now, it was finally his time to leave. Recalling all that had happened, he sighed. He waved at Eiron. "Goodbye."</p>
 <p>"Go. There is much you have to do in the real world. I hope you will be able to make the right choice, child."</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>"It's the first time I ever saw a piece of pork so juicy!" Frenda exclaimed in the yard. She cut two pieces off for Claudius. "Here. Give the spine cuts to the town chief's family. I'm sure Rubia would like it."</p>
 <p>"Ummm…" Claudius blushed upon mention of Rubia, but he received the piece of meat and prepared to head to the chief's home.</p>
 <p>But when he stood up, he completely froze.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Frenda wondered. "Don't be shy, son. Rubia is a good girl and you're a fine young lad. If we're following barbarian customs, you would've long gone to the chief's house to propose your marriage. But Rubia's a human, so you should be gentler. They have a saying… what is it… being romantic? I'm sure Rubia would like a romantic man better…"</p>
 <p>He still remained petrified despite his mother's ramblings. She looked up and found her son staring at the entrance of the house.</p>
 <p><em>What's wrong? Did a dragon show up in our house or something?</em> she thought as she turned back, only to end up frozen like Claudius.</p>
 <p>Leguna stood in front of the entrance and looked at the two. He couldn't recall who they were even after much thought, but he knew that the only reason he hadn't died of hunger. He smiled at them in a friendly manner and asked, "May I know where this is?"</p>
