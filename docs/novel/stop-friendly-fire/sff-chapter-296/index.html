There was also a small magic circle set up behind it. Lee Shin Woo knew about it, as it had been set up by the Archmage himself. It was a door. A door that led to the cave where the source of darkness was hidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was paramount that he took control of it...! In a sense, doing so was more important than dealing with the Emperor!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor's voice was dismal, yet emitted powerful energy. Lee Shin Woo sensed the unconcealable magic from within his voice. It was exactly as the Archmage remembered, but experiencing it first hand was... As expected, this was a true level 9.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lv9 Lich Emperor - Jissehanu Von Enard]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Compared to the Magic Emperor, who used his Lightning Bind to meet me indirectly, and the Garuda, which had been eaten away by the curse for so many years, severely weakening it... The Undead Emperor's power is completely different.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo smirked. This is how powerful he was when there was only a slight difference in their stats? No, that was impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After meeting the level 9 Emperor, Lee Shin Woo recollected something. Levels wouldn't increase by just accumulating stats. One could only grow by reaching a certain 'level' and proving themselves worthy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus far, Lee Shin Woo hadn't acutely felt this phenomenon because all of his feats had been more than enough to level up.

Well, I'll never know until I actually reach 25,600 stats. Until then, I have to just try my best. Like right now... No, even more so.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the pressure he was emanating, the Emperor gazed at him with drooping eyes. When they locked gazes, he desperately began to think. The moment he seemed surprised by the Emperor's power would mark the end of the line for him! Contrary to the Heaven Sundering General, the Undead Emperor was, in a different sense, a natural enemy to Lee Shin Woo's Acting skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I took care of a majority of the heroes.

I feel as though he's trying to change something from within me. His loyalty to me hasn't changed, yet he's completely different from you. What is it? My wise friend and teacher. Do you know what that is?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...You already know the answer, Your Majesty. My clever Emperor. He dared doubt you and wanted you to become exactly how he envisioned. That's nothing more than perverse loyalty. No, it's stubbornness!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Feo... I'm scared.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor said weakly. If the other heroes, who assumed that this guy was the final boss, were here, then what would they think? They would just be speechless and click their tongues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm afraid of the surface. I'm afraid of everything that's left me behind and changed.]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Do you really think so? My friend, do you really think that's true?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If you wish for it, then time itself will stop and bow before your feet, Your Majesty. So what is it that you are so worried about?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[My friend, I... I'm afraid of changing.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo was silent. He thought, 'This guy's like a hikikomori...', but there was nothing he could do about it since it was the main trait of the undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was actually kind of sad; even a level 9 undead, with such great magic and status, was the same as any other undead. He suddenly felt as though Seagald was amazing, as he had broken free of those shackles. It was such a relief that he'd already killed him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Your Majesty, you're already a perfect existence. No one can dare match up to you.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm not so sure. Perhaps... Perhaps I've already changed. My friend, why was it that I so ardently longed for the surface? Why was it that I wanted to get my revenge on Jirold so badly?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[He's the reason we're down here. It's because he stole the light away from us.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[But now, I feel so comfortable with this darkness. I don't want to leave. Every day, I imagine myself ripping Jirold to shreds, but even though I can go through the barrier, I can never bring myself to do so. My friend... where did I go wrong? Aah, what did I do!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Your Majesty...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor had only just realized that the undead curse he'd developed had a fatal flaw. But unfortunately, he couldn't turn back time. That's because undead, as a species, could not move forward by themselves. They not only couldn't move forward, but they also couldn't look back at the past either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dead. They had lost not only their lives but also a path to follow. Thus, they couldn't go forward, nor could they go back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...But Lee Shin Woo was here. If there wasn't a path, then he just needed to make one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That's too much, Your Majesty.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo did his duty as the Archmage and calmed the Emperor down. Though he had reached level 9 and become transcendent, the Emperor wasn't capable of escaping his fate as one of the dead. Thus, his statement was mixed with a small bit of pity towards the Emperor, Jissehanu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You can do anything you wish, Your Majesty. Taking a brief respite within here is your decision, so all of creation must abide by your wish. When you decide to leave here, then everyone will follow and support you!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Feo...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Please don't doubt yourself. You are an existence which has obtained great karma, yet you also transcend existence. Since you haven't forgotten about your revenge against Jirold at all! If Jirold were to appear before you, then wouldn't you raise one hand and crush him, Your Majesty!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That... Of course!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lich's encouraging words caused the Emperor to stand straight up and agree. Normally, the Emperor wouldn't move an inch, so the sudden movement caused the Emperor's guards to flinch. They should've noticed by now that Lee Shin Woo wasn't the Archmage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[My desire for revenge hasn't left me. Not at all. My friend, you spoke well. Although I felt comfort in the darkness, that doesn't mean my desire for revenge has disappeared! On the contrary, no matter how many days or years go by, my desire for revenge still remains strong!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That's right, Your Majesty! That hasn't changed at all!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Well, it shouldn't. He was an undead after all. This emotion (rejecting change) was an undead's most powerful emotion, and this emotion was controlling the Emperor as well, so there was no way he'd be able to escape its binds for even one second!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She spoke impolitely, but the Emperor wore all sorts of defensive equipment (that had been in the palace's treasury). And if that wasn't enough, he had wrapped scrolls engraved with all sorts of magic formulas onto his body. Thus, the Emperor's authority was still powerful.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And that was exactly what the hero, Izuna, had been hoping for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Magic Emperor seemed so pathetic that the Light General felt like she'd click her tongue.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite that, the Emperor was sure that his soldiers and knights, as well as the 12 Generals, would be able to take out the undead without any difficulty. But where exactly did this confidence come from!? He was definitely relying on the negative effects of becoming an undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...Then again, I'm not much different. A long time ago, I was willing to sacrifice my own body to get my revenge...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, at that moment... She shuddered. The alarm magic formulas that she'd set up prior had just gone off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thick smile appeared on her face.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Magic Emperor had always desired her, but she had always narrowly escaped his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn't go after her when Arema Steelworker was still on the surface, as he couldn't hurt his loyal retainer. But when he abandoned Sorura and went down underground, Sorura had immediately married another man. And she eventually became a widow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite that, the Emperor couldn't give up on her. He convinced her to become a Vampire so that she could eventually be with Arema, and ultimately transformed her into a Vampire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, he thought he was almost there. The Vampire that created another Vampire... In other words, the children would always think highly of their 'father'. Moreover, he was able to forge a deep connection with her through Lightning Bind, so it was easy for him to force a relationship with her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...However, she was barely affected by him, even after becoming a Vampire, perhaps due to her light element. Thus, the Emperor was forced to give up on her. But to think that she, who had rejected him for so long, had accepted him so easily!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...I can pretty much tell what you're thinking, but I can't let you do everything."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"O-Of course. I can't do something shameless to a virtuous woman like you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone said that in the beginning. In the beginning, at least. The Emperor decided to magnanimously accept her fussing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he never knew when Seagald would strike, so he didn't strip off all of his equipment. He only de-equipped a few pieces of excess equipment and briefly took off the scrolls that would impede his movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This all doesn't matter much anyway.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sorura, who was watching him, noted that he looked more and more hideous. Even so, she didn't let it worry her and she approached him. After all, saying a few things he wanted to hear would allow her to get close to him without him being suspicious of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then... Shall we go to bed?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, Your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor's hand touched Sorura's shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And a black flame shifted to the Emperor and blazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Huh?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is called Fire Shadow. You can either transfer your power to your contractee, or you can use magic through their body. Since Heaven Space or a space-type element is mixed into it, it proves that the underground heroes have grown beyond our wildest imaginations."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sorura said. Her face had already become black flame. Soon, even that flame shifted to the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he tried to deal with it with the darkness element or Lightning Bind, it was difficult, as Sorura was facing him. Sorura, who had always rejected him, was using that link between them to her advantage! The deep darkness that linked the two of them was getting in Lightning Bind's way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What is this... Keuk!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then... I hope you have a good night, Your Majesty."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor could say no more. The Fire's Shadow that came from Sorura engulfed the Magic Emperor and had erased him from his current location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sorura, now alone, was quite pale, but she hadn't died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I thought it'd burn me too. Was it a lie...? Well, whatever. There are still some things I need to do."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, she trusted the heroes, but the Magic Emperor may return, so she decided to destroy the place that he could return to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light erupted from her hand.
