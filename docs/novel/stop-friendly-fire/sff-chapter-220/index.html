 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following Lee Shin Woo's entrance, the Sun God religion's Pope and the Evileye General, Shurina Von Hegel were oddly confronting each other in front of the dungeon. The Pope was worried that the Emperor was meddling with Lee Shin Woo through the 12 generals, and the Evileye General was also suspicious of Lee Shin Woo's sudden appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neither side could voice such doubts first, but even so, they couldn't hide all their negative feelings. It had been a full day since they set up camp, and as the second day passed, the mood became even worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your Holiness!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides seemed almost ready to fight against each other, but the wounded paladins and priests had then come out of the dungeon and cooled everyone down. Even the Pope was surprised with their haggard and disheveled appearance; their equipment was riddled with holes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What's going on!? W-What happened to Kay!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sir Kay is fine! But the dungeon...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An uninjured priest reported whilst shaking. The priest looked like he couldn't believe what he himself was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It turned into a level 8 dungeon...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What!? No matter how strong Kay is, a level 8 dungeon is...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What did you say!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pope yelled in shock. The Evileye General listening in from the side was likewise shocked. A level 7 dungeon was already classified as a national disaster, yet the dungeon's level had risen even further! Ultimately, she yelled at the Pope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Now what are you going to do!? By recklessly entering the dungeon, the 'Sun God's hero' made the dungeon even more dangerous!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What idiocy. Man cannot change a dungeon. It's simply assuming its true form! On the contrary, it's&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">because</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;of Kay that we've figured out how dangerous the dungeon truly is; yet, instead of thanking him, you want to shift all the blame onto him? Is this how the 12 generals do things? Is this how..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Enough!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye General knew what he would say next. He had wanted to say, 'Is this how the Empire does things?' He was trying to insult the Emperor! Capital punishment wouldn't be enough for his crime!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The dungeon was dormant! If he hadn't gone into the dungeon, then it would've remained peaceful!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Do you really think that? Have you never studied the basics (of dungeons)? I suppose being one of the 12 generals isn't all that. Isn't that so?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Eek..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the Pope remained relaxed and replied whilst snorting, and the Evileye General, who'd wanted to retort, was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course she'd be. The fact that the 12 generals took shifts to watch over the dungeon meant that the word 'peaceful' didn't apply to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They knew that something would go wrong eventually, but because they didn't have enough manpower available, they put forth a stopgap measure instead of a proper one. In a way, the Magic Empire had brought this on themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Before you ask the Sun God religion to pay for its crimes, get the Emperor to apologize to all the citizens."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That doesn't matter right now. We need to do something about the level 8 dungeon!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha. That was my original intention, but... I guess you're finally open to a constructive conversation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Keuk...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pope watched as the Evileye General bit her lower lip in humiliation, and snorted once more. However, he wasn't actually feeling that great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He came out strongly, so that the blame wouldn't be shifted onto the Sun God religion, but he couldn't help being worried about Lee Shin Woo, who was trapped inside the dungeon. Lee Shin Woo was the Sun God religion's treasure, as well as the link between him and the Lawrence shop. There was so much more he had to do, so he couldn't lose him here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Report this matter to the Emperor in person. Kay is strong, but he can't clear a level 8 dungeon all on his own. If the other 12 generals are busy and cannot intervene, then you must get the Emperor to take action. The Empire's in danger. Do you understand?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who's fault do you think this is... I understand. I was going to report this matter to His Majesty, anyway!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye General tried to keep what was left of her pride, but the Pope had become so serious that she couldn't maintain eye contact and just went along with what he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun God religion may be weak, but the Pope was always someone others couldn't look down upon. Compared to other religious orders, where the Pope was selected based on support, irrespective of level, the Pope of the Sun God religion was a priest who could control powerful flames from a young age and was a hero who had single-handedly rebuilt the declining Sun God religion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of both power and resolve, the Sun God religion's Pope was far greater than the other religious orders' popes. He had brought his order a young hero who would bring the order to new heights, so if Lee Shin Woo survived the dungeon, then the Sun God religion would soon be known as the most respectable religion in the land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'But if that happens, it could harm the Emperor's reputation. Kay has to die no matter what...! We have to stop the level 8 dungeon's countercurrent, but I think we could wait until he dies first!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Pope mostly knew what she was thinking. He saw her call her soldiers over and secretly give them orders, so he clicked his tongue and called for the priests on standby. If that's how she was going to play, then he would respond in earnest. He already had something up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Relay this news to the Great God, Merciful God, and Living God religious orders as soon as possible. There are things that we should tell them, but also things that we should hide. Do you understand what I'm saying?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I understand, Your Holiness. Then I'll get going immediately!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The relation between the Sun God religion and all the other religious orders wasn't good. However, when they fought against a common enemy, then they would prove to be the most trustworthy of allies. And if something this big was going on, then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I'd rather not let them in on our pie, but it's not worth trading our hero for it.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the Pope and the Evileye General were finished taking appropriate measures, they looked at each other more menacingly than before. Then, the dungeon began to vibrate greatly. To be exact, the clashes within the dungeon had surpassed the dungeon's ability to contain them, and were thus affecting the outside world as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh my god. The entrance to the dungeon has collapsed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This mana I feel from within the dungeon... Wait a second. Isn't this an undead's mana...?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pope furrowed his brow. He knew about the disaster that was befalling the Underground Empire. It hadn't spread to the surface yet, but the undead had appeared in the dungeons halfway underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I knew this would happen; the underground curse still hasn't been taken care of it.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dozens of years ago, each temple had been given an oracle. An oracle telling them to elect a hero to purify the undead curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, the Emperor and the religious orders selected heroes and dispatched them to the Underground Empire. He hadn't heard of them ever coming back, but he remembered the Emperor saying that 'the curse has been taken care of, and that the barrier is as perfect as ever'. The Pope hadn't believed him, but he'd thought that the Emperor had something ready just in case... But considering what was happening now, it seemed like he didn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Emperor. What exactly are you hoping for? How long are you going to stay on the sidelines and just watch? Do you really want us to all die together?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wouldn't leave them to die.
