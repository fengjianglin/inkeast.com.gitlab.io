He was like a mummy who was all skin and bones, and according to Lee Shin Woo's assessment, his name showed up as [Lv6 Undead Commander].</span></p>

At the same time, he could easily tell that the lord's intellect... was higher than a normal undead as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Ahem... Is Marquis Setapen... doing well?]</span></p>

Indeed. I had thought he would pass on all of his forces along with his estate, but to think that he had kept people like you by his side; what a sly old fox... Ahem, he's a powerful man.]</span></p>

Even if the undead possessed a similar level of intellect, when thrust into a combat scenario, several undead recklessly threw themselves into the fight; on the other hand, if they met other undead, and remembered their status when they were alive, they would act the part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an extremely thin line between insanity and normalcy for them; only by understanding and arbitrating between that line would one be able to command them. For the past half year, Lee Shin Woo had encountered countless undead and had roughly been able to ascertain how to do this.</span></p>

He didn't know how he felt about Marquis Setapen, but now wasn't the time for Lee Shin Woo to be worrying about something like that!</span></p>

Since surveillance has been tough with just the knights we have.]</span></p>

The lord didn't call one of the 12 generals, Lee Shin Woo had entered the city, and they got the opportunity to scout out the area all at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jin was speechless as he saw Lee Shin Woo march out of the reception area (as Jin obviously couldn't go in), where the level 6 undead lord, the Knight Leader (a level 5 Elder Knight), as well as undead wizards resided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'You're really...'</span></p>

Lee Shin Woo volunteered to patrol the outskirts so that he would avoid the lord's suspicion; he pricked his ears and activated his mana senses, and then began patrolling his allotted area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Sir Seta. Thank you for all your hard work!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[That's correct. I was patrolling an important, protected area. Hundreds of knights go through dozens of routes in order to patrol so that there's no gap in our defenses.]</span></p>

For reference, they were telling him about the protected area; all the knights that had participated in human testing were buried there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Your horse is quite splendid, Sir Seta.]</span></p>

There should only be dead horses in the Empire by now... is what he thought, yet Lee Shin Woo didn't utter those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"How unfortunate. If I have the chance, I'll find a good horse for you."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'There're two over here. And it looks like they're the only three disguised on the western outskirts, but there's actually one more hiding there as well.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though they were all undead, the dead in Kadinan, and especially the knights, trusted Lee Shin Woo, as he emphasized loyalty to the Empire. The most important virtue for a knight within the Empire was strength, while the second most important virtue was loyalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmm. It seems that the north side's defense isn't up to par. Shouldn't we adjust the patrol route a bit?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Lee Shin Woo made it seem like he was concerned about the defense of the city and their patrols while in actuality, he was fishing for information; he acted like he actually had some 'recommendations' for them, so the undead didn't even suspect Lee Shin Woo in the slightest. There was no way for them to be suspicious of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[You truly are perceptive, Sir Seta. However, there's a hidden magic trap over there, so...]</span></p>

I wondered if they knew about it, but it seems like these guys really don't know that their magic trap is broken and still think it's working... If that's the case, then I can say that there're really no reserve troops over there.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lee Shin Woo enthusiastically continued patrolling and collecting information; as a result, he figured out their patrol routes, the scope of the patrol, when they changed shifts, and even the route by which they were deployed and returned. It only took him a couple of days to successfully figure this all out, and organized the information in his head such that it was much simpler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Good. Then we should..."</span></p>

He started with the outskirts and their complicated patrolling routes. Once he saw Lee Shin Woo detailing where and when the knights were stationed at each and every moment, he couldn't understand how he had come up with it all. However, once he looked over the details, he couldn't deny that it looked accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This is way too easy. We can already infiltrate the facility, huh?"</span></p>

All while keeping a close eye on the movements of the magicians, especially on the level 6 Magician Leader.</span></p>
