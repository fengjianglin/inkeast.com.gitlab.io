 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'It's not over.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo narrowed his eyes. Although the Garuda's corpse had disappeared, it hadn't dropped any loot yet. He had a hunch as to why. Since a snow-white light rose from within the Garuda's body as it disappeared and was sticking to the Titan's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the greatsword melted away, Zenon immediately left the blade and entered the Titan. This peculiar phenomenon probably had something to do with Zenon... His assumption was completely correct. Zenon was busy speaking with the Garuda's final remaining will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Young spirit. Could you inherit my will?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[L-Lord Garuda. I'm just a regular spirit following this human...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zenon was conversing with a part of the Garuda's consciousness. When it had realized that its body and soul were being eroded by the undead curse, the Garuda had torn a piece of its soul off and stored it away; its soul was incredibly pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, not everyone could do this just because they were a high level. It was only possible for the Garuda because it had developed its innate element, the Shining Flame, and the light element to near perfection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The fact that I was able to meet you, one who wields the same fire energy as me, before I died in vain must be due to God. And if you've chosen that human as your contractor, then I will respect your decision.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Is that so...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Garuda spoke amicably, but it just made Zenon feel a sense of awe and break into a cold sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It probably didn't understand Zenon and Lee Shin Woo's relationship in the least. If that's not it, then it wouldn't be so calm! Zenon thought about it faintly, but he didn't say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If you have something you want from me, then... Please say so.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His short interaction with Lee Shin Woo was drawing attention to him. Right now, the right move was to just listen to what the Garuda had to say!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[This human, who you've entrusted your soul to, is incredibly strong. Moreover, he's realized part of the truth of this world at such a young age, so if he doesn't tread down the wrong path, then he should be able to correct the chaos of this world.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Chaos...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You should already know. That curse, which was able to corrupt even I, who had transcended death, came about due to mankind's unending greed... If left unchecked, the world is doomed. So long as your contractor... a hero doesn't correct it.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. The Garuda possessed some divinity, albeit weak, so it knew that Lee Shin Woo was one of God's heroes! Hearing that, Zenon slightly tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Then why aren't you telling him this yourself?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's related to what I'm about to tell you. I will give you the power to erase anything, so... if that hero treads the wrong path, then I'd like you to destroy him with your own two hands.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zenon could tell how earnest the Garuda was being and just laughed inside. He doesn't think that that's actually possible, does he? However, the Garuda maintained its serious tone and continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Your contractor's ability is exceptional. At such a young age, he not only reached level 8 but also possesses the ability to distort the truth. In my long life, I've never seen someone like him. He should be able to correct the chaos that plagues the surface and the underground. However, if he were to go astray, then it will result in unspeakable disaster...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yes, that's true.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Lee Shin Woo was level 8, he considered life and death the same. And with his Wild Card skill, he could distort reality in a limited space. The Garuda probably didn't know this, but Lee Shin Woo's innate element, Dark Shadow, was incredibly dangerous (The Garuda thought that Lee Shin Woo's innate element was something like the Fiery Sand's Dark Flame Ghosts' Dark Flame).&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if he were to advance even further? What if he were to use that power for evil? The world would become even worse than it is now. He was right of course. He's right, but...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'But I don't think this human will do something so troublesome. Moreover, contrary to the Garuda, he hasn't been affected by the curse, and can actually use the curse for himself...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zenon couldn't imagine Lee Shin Woo straying from his path. If he had to be wary of anyone who had a dangerous ability and was talented, then there were so many more that he'd have to be worried about. After all, even the Garuda, who had obtained divinity, had caused a lot of trouble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, he had the gall to say something like 'exterminate the hero', so Zenon was speechless. Regardless of the why, Zenon thought it just wanted vengeance against the one who'd killed it...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What would Lee Shin Woo... The contractor of the Spirits' Spring, say at a time like this...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo would keep his mouth shut and get what he could first. If he retorted, then the Garuda might leave, which would be such a waste! Zenon nodded his head and the Garuda continued in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Of course, you do not possess the power to oppose your contractor. So I'll give you what you need. I will instill my power into this golem that you currently reside in, so if the time comes when you must put him down, you just need to come into this golem. It will cause the giant to ignite the accumulating shining flames inside itself, and even your contractor won't be able to avoid death.]</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...I understand.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[And I'll give you my power as well. You will become my successor who wields both light and flame, so if you continue to train both, then you will one day be able to use my innate element... Shining Flame! I grant you this authority for the sake of all spirits, so if you're in a situation where your own power is insufficient, then you should borrow their power to overcome it!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So the Garuda&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">did</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;have an underlying motive for bestowing his power. He was giving him one of the Garuda's abilities, the power of light which could sever all! It thought that if he was given this power, which could sever all connections if need be, then he wouldn't be controlled by Lee Shin Woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Then, young spirit. I hope you make the right decision. I hope that you use this power that I leave behind for the betterment of this world...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Garuda's remaining consciousness emitted a bright light and split into two. One went into Zenon, and the other was absorbed by the Titan. It forcefully raised Zenon's 'level' and raised his body and soul to new heights. To be more specific, Zenon's karma exploded and he leveled up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lv8 Shining Salamander Zenon]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn't all. Zenon realized that he could now use the high rank level 1 light element. To think he, who was born a fire spirit, would be able to use another element as well! The Garuda wasn't wrong when it said that he would be its successor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what he gained wasn't purely positive either. The Garuda's will, which possessed divinity, had a huge effect on Zenon and planted a sense of distrust in Lee Shin Woo. But it was the exact opposite of Zenon's original feelings, so he felt quite uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Is this the price of thoughtlessly accepting a god's power?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yeah. That's not something you accept without thinking.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had forged an improper contract with God and become a magical girl... No wait, he was forced into becoming a hero. Lee Shin Woo genuinely gave him some advice and Zenon found himself nodding automatically... But then asked in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Did you hear everything!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Not everything, but most of it. If it knew that I was the one who made the Titan and it was made of bone, then it wouldn't have done something as stupid as talking within it. Even at the very end, that asshole looked down on me.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...I think he did. He thought he'd lost to you because of his corruption.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it was true that the Garuda had weakened, so much so that it was incomparable to its original strength, but had made a basic miscalculation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It hadn't realized that Lee Shin Woo had used his ability to 'create a stage in which he could win against the Garuda'! In other words, Lee Shin Woo was way too talented!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'll take care of it, so stay still.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Mm, Mmmm...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo looked squarely at Zenon with his Soul Seeing Eye. Immediately after, he used his Dark Flame and Shining Flame to cut out a piece of Zenon's body. Then, the unpleasant feeling disappeared.
