 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was really worried about Prince and Kratia too, but with Jin and Arema fighting against the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> Sword God, he should have enough time. Moreover, Kratia had harmonized with her orb, temporarily boosting her abilities above their limit, so she wouldn't die, regardless of how the situation progressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uuuuaaaaaaah!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo observed the disparate energy deep within her and his expression soured. He'd learned three innate elements, so he'd thought it would be easy to save her, but things were a lot different from what he'd expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Seagald, you bastard."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seagald hadn't killed his sister just because he was a crazy bastard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He inflicted a grievous injury onto Seira and had simultaneously infused <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> into her. The <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> and the undead curse, which would transform one into the undead depending on how close they were to death, had overlapped and had become something else entirely. And that was...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Anti-Skull...?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. He thought he'd felt this energy before, but it was similar to Seagald Von Retadane's mana. In other words, this was a ceremony that turned someone into a member of Anti-Skull. Seagald had attempted to kill his sister and induct her into Anti-Skull!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said something about 'losing her way' or that he'd 'show her the right path', but how could Anti-Skull be the right path!? He was willing to go so far as to kill his own little sister to ensure that she was on his side!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'As I thought, all these undead bastards are crazy! ...But wait a sec.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as the different energies interfered with each other, Lee Shin Woo came to another realization. The <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> element had eliminated a portion of the undead curse's mana and had changed its inherent properties, creating something entirely new... It was similar to his Pauls' mana. He felt as though he was struck by lightning when he came to a realization.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Was the reason they came into contact with the Pauls to perfect the Anti-Skull experiment...? So&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I'm</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;the reason Anti-Skull was perfected?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Pauls had told him that they'd met with Seagald, yet they had left unscathed. If that's the case, then why did they come into contact with Pauls that weren't under the direct command of the Heaven Defying General? It made sense if they were used as data to perfect the Anti-Skull test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that's the case, then was the reason Seagald chose now to act because he'd gotten inspiration from the way Lee Shin Woo created the Pauls and managed to complete the Anti-Skull test? So he'd led his own little sister to Bayran, and had even led the other forces here to cause chaos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Guuuuu. Huaaaaaaah!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you were smart enough to make that call, then you should've just told your little sister how to live. You may have copied my methods, but at the end of the day, you're still undead...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he understood Seira's condition, he attempted to reverse her condition with each of his innate elements one-by-one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried Dark Shadow first. It would've been easy if he could sever cause-and-effect, reversing her death, but... He'd somewhat expected this himself, but he wasn't at the level where he could do that yet. It was similar to bringing a dead person back to life. If he could do this, then he would've given Jin a human body already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried his Dark Flame next. He wanted to 'steal' the curse that ate away at her, but because of what Seagald had done, her mana, the undead curse, and Seagald's <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> element were mixing together and becoming something else entirely. Unless he stole&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">all&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">of her mana, there was nothing he could do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were to steal all of her mana, she would vanish without a trace. The Shining Flame was also out of the question using the same logic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What about light? Eh, this won't work either. Seagald's <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> element devoured Seira's light and actually became stronger. He prepared this specifically for Seira... Though my darkness should work.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So long as the curse was, at its core, based on the darkness element, it had no choice but to be controlled by it. Lee Shin Woo had already achieved peak darkness mastery, and if he linked himself with Seira's mana, which filled her body to the brim and was bursting, then he could cause her mana to change in a completely different direction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...But it would still change her into an undead. He would stop her from becoming a part of Anti-Skull, but would in-turn turn her into an undead like the Pauls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Then... What other options do I have? Sacrifice?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, when he'd saved Ye Jin Jin, he'd gained a skill called Sacrifice due to his karma. It was a skill that allowed him to kill himself to save someone on the brink of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd accumulated 164 lives as if they were mileage, so he decided to test out the skill. But then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The target is changing due to a status ailment. Thus, you cannot target them with this skill.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How can you call this a status ailment!? You said I could save someone on the brink of death! She's clearly dying! So does it only work when they're dying from something physical!? A case like that'd be hard to find. What a shitty skill!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uuuaaah!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected of Anti-Skull's leader. Lee Shin Woo had mastered several abilities, yet even he was hard-pressed to deal with this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, it was because Seagald was this skilled that he was able to free the undead from the curse and turn them into Anti-Skull in the first place! He was so skilled that it pissed Lee Shin Woo off!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...Alright. Let's give up on saving her. Granny, you lived a long life.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He boldly decided to give up on her. Plus, he didn't really cherish her enough to risk his life to save her. He just thought that it'd be better to save her. But because it wouldn't work, he had to give up on it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if he just left her like this, she would definitely become a powerful ally to Seagald in the future (for a level 8, she didn't seem like much, but she might get stronger as an undead), so rather than let that happen, it would be better to kill her here and now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if it were possible, then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sseup. What should I do with you..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uuuaaaah."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even now, Seira was doing her best to resist the transformation, but her screams were getting louder and louder. The <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> element, which was attempting to remake her, the undead curse, which had undergone a special evolution that made it more offensive, and her own mana, which wasn't capable of mounting a proper resistance and was being influenced by the two...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Why did he have to pierce her heart, not only infusing his <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> element into her, but also contaminating all of her veins and arteries. ...This bastard. He even anticipated my intervention.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Seira was the hero that had operated in the Underground Empire the longest, so she had accumulated the most of the undead curse within her body. All those factors worked together to cause the worst possible outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In any case, she wouldn't last long.
