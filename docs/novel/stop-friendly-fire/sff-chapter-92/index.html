Someone might pick a fight with him if he were self-conceited or became too relaxed. It was always important to strive to improve oneself; even his own parents had told him that.</span></p>

There was nothing in the sewers this time too.</span></p>

At the very least, he wouldn't make a mistake while controlling this few weapons.</span></p>

He checked his stats, his skills, and even the titles he'd acquired thus far. His self-inspection was perfect. Even if he encountered a level 6 elite monster, he would be able to take it on without any problems.</span></p>

He took a 'deep breath', opened his inventory, and took out a book from it. It was the book seemingly left behind by the Elementalist Mellonia, who had an amicable relationship with the Dryads.</span></p>

Though he was given the ability to speak and read this world's language, because he had absorbed countless undeads' memories and experiences, he didn't really need to use that ability anymore, and was able to read the letters naturally.</span></p>

As he read the first volume, Lee Shin Woo was able to supplement his knowledge considerably with the absorbed Silver Ice Tiger's canine.</span></p>

He laughed at the fact that he was able to acquire both from Mellonia. High ranked knowledge and experience; it was easy for him to tell that Mellonia was someone renowned when she was alive as she possessed both.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'But even Mellonia is saying that an Elementalist can't use elemental power themselves, but instead uses the spirits to acquire it...'</span></p>

As Mellonia said, spirits are as smart or smarter than humans, so they can also move independently, and the more authority the spirits have over an element, the more powerfully they can wield that element...</span></p>

It was a phrase that he really didn't like. Since entering the Underground Empire, the term 'immortality' could cause Lee Shin Woo to shake.</span></p>

She said that she didn't want any harm to come to the Dryads, yet she was clearly a researcher who studied the Dryads.</span></p>
