If that's the case, then what about the director, Arema Steelworker? He would obviously be an even higher level than the golem... then, wouldn't he be the general the golem's talking about? Lee Shin Woo had definitely miscalculated.</span></p>

I didn't think that, but... if I think that way, it all makes sense. Golems can't turn into the undead and they shouldn't die of old age either... But it's way too surprising that there's a golem with an innate ego. And a high leveled ego at that.'</span></p>

Jin, who had been observing the doors that lined the passageway, was shocked and slightly stepped back.</span></p>

There were several roads that branched off from the passageway and even those forked roads branched out into several different paths. Jin wouldn't have known any better, but Lee Shin Woo clearly felt a mass of powerful mana at the end of each of those forked roads.</span></p>

It made sense how they threw away level 3 or level 4 golems like they were nothing. It was possible for the contents of any one of these several dozen rooms to be able to take down all of those weak golems that were destroyed by Lee Shin Woo and Jin before.</span></p>

Lee Shin Woo started to become curious as to what their mission was. But for starters, it did seem like they definitely weren't on the side of the Imperial Army, which had degenerated into the undead...</span></p>

It was an interaction that was worlds apart from Anti-Skull's door lock! It felt like Lee Shin Woo's mana senses had advanced just by watching the process.</span></p>

If they don't understand, they could end up dead and would have just given them unnecessary information. If that's the case, then first...
