 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo figured out where Seagald was. He was already in the center of Bayran, protected by the thorn wall! Tarian's force had just been bait and the golems, which they'd form a temporary alliance with, were as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[So they were trying to kill us here?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No. They made it so that you couldn't interfere. It seems like their interests don't align with yours. ...Or they know exactly who you are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after absorbing his precious subordinate's bones, Lee Shin Woo didn't know what Seagald's true intentions were. However, he was sure of one thing: that this loyalty towards the Empire hadn't changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Was Anti-Skull really just created to protect people from the undead curse? To kill the Emperor, who spread the undead curse? No, probably not. There's no way it's that simple.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On second thought, there was something else that was strange. The Undead Emperor, Jissehanu, had&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">seemingly</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;been researching immortality but was actually looking for a way to break through the barrier. And there must've been a few people who knew what he was planning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'The Retadanes are a family of high rank nobles that have been with Jissehanu since the very beginning. Were they really not aware of how to get past the barrier? Seira might not have, but it wouldn't make sense for Seagald Von Retadane, the past head of the Retadane family, to have no knowledge about it.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No... What even was Anti-Skull? Was it truly an organization designed to research methods to resist the undead curse? Was that all? If not, then perhaps...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Damn. Let's think about this later. Let's get a move on for now!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Agreed. It seems like our alliance with Anti-Skull is already meaningless...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As always, Arema Steelworker despised following Lee Shin Woo's orders and moving according to his will. However, he hated Seagald Von Retadane more, who'd put him in this situation in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above all, he wanted to know what Seagald was planning. His strength may not be enough, but he was sure the Heaven Defying General would be able to find out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm going at full speed, so try to keep up. Leave behind anyone who can't keep up."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It might take a bit longer, but we're all going.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Your choice. Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin really ran at full speed. They couldn't reveal everything, so Lee Shin Woo didn't reveal his darkness and Jin didn't reveal her light. However, just the fact that she used all of her skills and exhibited such overwhelming speed was enough to astound the others with her speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That horse...!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I knew he wasn't normal, but to think even his horse was unusual!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Metal Army realized just how far ahead Lee Shin Woo had gotten, gritted their teeth, and followed him. Fortunately, no other traps activated as they rushed after him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arema and the rest of the golems were relieved, thinking that all the traps had been destroyed already. They couldn't even imagine that Lee Shin Woo was actively disarming them as they went along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Anyway, what was that explosion all about anyway? It must've been Seagald Von Retadane. If not, then it might've been the Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'It looked like magic to me. It'd be nice if it was Kratia or Prince, but it probably wasn't. Which means...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing that came to mind was the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin. There was a chance he was here. The palace might've sent some 'insurance', aside from the Golden Shadow General.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There really are three of the four Heavenly Commanders (of the 12 Generals) here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that were indeed true, then not immediately striking down Arema Steelworker while also bringing him to his side was a wise decision. If the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> Sword God and the Archmage were truly there, then it wouldn't matter how strong Lee Shin Woo was, he wouldn't be able to take them on whilst protecting his allies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Damn. That only matters if they're still alive.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a test, Lee Shin Woo sent all of them a private chat request. All of them denied his request, but the fact that they even denied his request meant that they were still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it also meant that they didn't have the time to answer him... That's probably what it meant. It was just a hypothesis, but there should be three level 8 members of the 12 Generals in there!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lord Paul Zero!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[We were waiting for you!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo soon arrived in front of the thorn wall. He'd called the Chi Pauls beforehand. Aside from the three who'd been injured and retreated, all of the Chi Pauls had gathered here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I see it. The thorn wall... Huh? Are those your subordinates?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[They're not weaker than me. Where exactly did they come from...?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arema Steelworker and his elites had arrived. They were shocked once they saw the Chi Pauls standing by. Although they were standing right in front of them, they couldn't properly sense their presence, as if they were looking at the Golden Shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I would've been suspicious if you hadn't called your subordinates in such a dire situation. So you did have your forces here.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[They're all strong too. How did you nurture them in the Empire...? No, wait. Did they come from the surface?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...Hoo.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golems stirred up a commotion while the Chi Pauls desperately suppressed their urge to kill them. He knew this would happen. After all, they had been used as their test subjects in the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, unlike Tarian, they were decent enough actors to not allow their emotions to show. It was all due to Lee Shin Woo's influence. This is why you had to have a good master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Paul Zero. Do you have a way to get through the wall? If you don't, then we have no choice but for the two of us to attack at once.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We don't have time to waste here."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo replied and extended his hand, feeling as though Arema was a pain in the ass. Even now, he was trying to get a feel for his abilities. The area of the wall his fingertips were pointed at collapsed without any resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had condensed the Evil Eye ore into a single, tiny piece, which was floating over to him. But such a trivial thing had given Arema Steelworker quite the shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Impossible. The thorn wall!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Let's go."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd completely broken the link in the affected area, so the collapsed area didn't repair itself. With just one gesture, Lee Shin Woo had broken the thorn wall, the Empire's pride and joy. Lee Shin Woo just took command of the Chi Pauls and went inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arema Steelworker couldn't believe his eyes and pounded on the thorn wall with his full strength. Aside from the area Lee Shin Woo had just demolished, the rest of the wall retained its incredible durability.</span></p>

Kratia, who knew that Lee Shin Woo was the Heaven Defying General, looked slightly relieved, while Prince was shocked that the Heaven Defying General had shown up with the Metal General.

What? She wasn't undead? Her undead transformation was being delayed? What the hell did that even mean? He didn't know what it meant, so he examined her himself and came to a shocking conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'The undead curse... Still hasn't properly saturated her body.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was definitely being affected by the undead curse.

It was going into the cannon.</span></p>

The mana of the city's inhabitants and spirits would be gathered by the Spirit General's ability so that the cannon could be fired. The undead curse had filled the Undead Empire, so the curse that affected her body was being drained by the cannon itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was truly horrifying, but... It was precisely because of this that she hadn't turned into an undead yet and had survived. No one could've expected this. They hadn't scrapped this failed project before moving on to the next, which had resulted in all their failed products remaining here. That's what this all meant.</span></p>
