 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good. Then, shall we begin?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Why are you putting your hand on my back?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sand, which formed the desert, was devoured by the hot wind and disappeared. Lee Shin Woo couldn't defy gravity and began to fall, but even then, he remained calm. Jin remained calm as well, thinking 'Shin Woo will do something about it', but... Lee Shin Woo placed his hand on Jin's back, causing Jin to flinch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I guess I have no choice."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, what are you doing all of a sudden... Heugyak!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only for a brief moment, but Jin was flustered and confused. However, he was soon able to get a hold of himself, as images and messages flowed into his head through the Assimilation skill. Calmly thinking about it, he was the strange one, as he was thinking about something so preposterous while they were falling down. No, the images flowing through his head were just as preposterous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I told you, I won't sprout wings!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The image is good enough. The design's perfect. I'm going."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I've already tried it before. I told you, I can't do it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Jin had once thought that he could sprout wings. Why? In the past, when Lee Shin Woo had used Bone Reinforcement on him with winged monsters' bones, Jin was lucky enough to learn the 'Fly' skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he was really flustered back then, and tried his best to hide the truth from Lee Shin Woo. He then tried practicing it by himself later, but... He failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, you can do it. Focus on sharing our consciousness. I was going to attempt this after I'd become more accustomed to the Disguise skill but..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no way it'd work with just your Disguise skill... Huh?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin couldn't create wings, even if he used his 'Steel Heart' ability. The Fly skill would only allow an individual to fly if they had the means to do so; it wasn't a skill that created weighty, steel wings that would enable him to fly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that's the case, then why did he even receive the Fly skill? If an individual isn't capable of using a skill, then they wouldn't learn it, but why... Jin questioned and completely gave up on their dream (it was really more Lee Shin Woo's dream) of flying. He was a little disappointed that he wasn't able to make Lee Shin Woo's dream come true, but that was a secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Guooooooh!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, that guy's locked onto us. Hurry up."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mmmm...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lee Shin Woo's images were much clearer than his own attempts. He would focus Steel Heart on his body and create a new, exterior armor...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Like the design?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah. Disguise!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"S-Steel Heart!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the level 9 Disguise skill was used on himself, it was absolute. However, when it was used on other people, it was quite strict, especially for things that didn't originally exist... one could say that creating wings out of thin air was pretty much impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Jin possessed the Steel Heart skill, which coated his body in a steel-like substance using mana. Because of that, it wasn't difficult for him to attach wings to his body. But this would result in the same outcome as when he had tried it by himself. This time though, Lee Shin Woo had designed the wings, all of the details... And the power system as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And through the simultaneous activation of Lee Shin Woo's Disguise and Jin's Steel Heart skills, the image became a reality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jeez, this... is really embarrassing!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the slightest of movements, Jin could easily control the tough, huge steel wings, while also having firm abdominal armor to support them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These wings should allow him to 'slide down a slope', but it obviously didn't end there. The wings, the abdominal armor, and the leg armor were perforated with dozens of fine holes, and pipes were routed throughout the armor, acting as its power supply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Jin, all you need to do is let it out!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Keuk... Magic Breath!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through the combination of the Disguise and Steel Heart skills, Jin looked outwardly like a steel Pegasus. While they plummeted to the ground, Jin was somehow able to use his Magic Breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to their near perfect Assimilation, Jin was able to store Lee Shin Woo's High Rank Wind with his Magic Breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I did it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of his desperate training, Jin had become capable of discharging Magic Breath from anywhere on his body. The Magic Breath flowed out of his toes first, and then traveled along the pipes and spurted wind out of all the holes connected to them. They began to float. He wasn't sure if they could truly fly yet, but they could at least float!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the wind was too chaotic, so they were immediately overturned within the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ugyak!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Control it! Keep your balance... That guy's opening its mouth!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kii, Kihiiii... Kyaaaaaaah!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Desert Ghost had sucked up all the sand, it wouldn't allow any bugs to buzz around in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It marked its target and opened its mouth. The rotating sand, heat, and wind mixed together and changed into something unknown, like lava. Since it wasn't all elemental power and had some substance to it, Lee Shin Woo knew he couldn't handle it with just his Absorption skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'We have to dodge...!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body became tense at the thought of avoiding it, but Jin recklessly discharged the wind element through his Magic Breath (in other words, Wind Breath). But releasing wind like this wouldn't do any good. They wouldn't be able to maneuver properly; at best, they would be able to hover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin was a sprinter in the past, so he had excellent motor skills. Even so, it would be impossible for him to control something he'd never had in the past. But then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Ah!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Flying skill activated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The Low Rank Fly skill has become Lv10 and evolves to the intermediate level! Agility has increased by 75. You now have an unclear understanding of the fundamentals of flying. You can fly with any means at your disposal. The higher your agility, the quicker and more safely you can fly.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had first acquired the Fly skill, it was low rank level 8. Of course, the level was meaningless, as he couldn't even fly back then, but it had went up by two levels all of a sudden and reached the intermediate level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Jin instinctively understood how to move the wings Lee Shin Woo had designed for him. The wings fluttered, and the finely controlled wind was sprayed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Gugyaaaaah!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Just wait until after the battle!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of Jin's superlative speed was concentrated entirely into his flight; at that moment, they, who had been flying round and round, disappeared instantly and reappeared in the opposite direction. Rather than flight, it was more like teleportation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clump of lava passed where they had just been and flew far away; it hit the dungeon's wall and melted it. If it continuously spewed out lava, then it would be able to melt the entire dungeon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Guoooooooh!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoo. Do you think you can do it, Shin Woo? Fighting while running on the ground and flying in the air are completely different."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha, of course they are."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a short while ago he'd been so unconfident, but now... Jin, who'd gotten a feel for flying, ignored the hot wind, as well as the rotating sand storm within it, and circled around the Desert Ghost with ease. On the contrary, it worried Lee Shin Woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lee Shin Woo was already connected to Jin. If Jin could do it, then Lee Shin Woo could too. In conclusion, with enough spatial awareness (front to back, left and right, and top to bottom), all one needed to do was control their body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright, then... I'm going!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Jin stepped in the air, they charged at the Desert Ghost with explosive acceleration!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Desert Ghost attempted to eviscerate them by making use of the hot air around it; it divided the air into dozens of wind blades and rushed towards them, but Jin avoided them with ease and continued to charge forward. Even the sandstorm, which had fused with the wind, was of no use. Its wind couldn't even catch Jin's shadow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were penetrating through a level 8 elite's defenses (the sandstorm and hot air), they were still unscathed. But in order to attack it, Lee Shin Woo would have to go face-to-face with the shield of hot wind that covered its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He got a signal from Jin, inwardly nodded his head, and gripped his greatsword. Now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kyahaaaaah!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heup!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo forcefully swung his greatsword, his blade emitting a brilliant red light. From an outsider's point of view, it may look like a toothpick against a natural disaster, but at the moment of impact, the natural disaster was the one that folded. A portion of the Desert Ghost's typhoon, which consisted of the sand, the wind, and the heat, was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that wasn't the end. It had lost its balance, and Lee Shin Woo absorbed the typhoon's energy into his greatsword. Then, the greatsword released wind blades at the Desert Ghost's face!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Gyaaaah!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even while flustered, the Desert Ghost quickly fused the wind and heat near its face and formed a shield to protect itself. Jin followed up on Lee Shin Woo's wind blades by picking up the pace. The greatsword, which emanated a red light, let out a crackle and was covered in golden lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Suck out all of its heat!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I can't suck out all of it. However... I can do something about that shield!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind blades crashed into the monster's shield and disappeared; they blew up right in front of its face, so the monster briefly closed its eyes and stiffened. At that moment, Lee Shin Woo's greatsword sliced through the shield like paper and burrowed into its shell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thunder Strike!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo unleashed Bursting Thunder's true power, causing its forehead to explode. It didn't matter that his opponent was a level 8 elite. His Rebellion skill had increased his stats by almost 30% and adding the speed of Jin's flight, as well as Zenon's ability (which nullified the Desert Ghost's fire shield), Lee Shin Woo managed to land a single powerful strike with Bursting Thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Plus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thorn Shadow!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kyahaaaaaaahk!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Critical Hit!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shadow greatswords sprouted from the greatsword's edge and flailed around inside its head. The serious injury caused the surrounding wind to momentarily stop, and the previously uplifted sand to fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It screamed, and Lee Shin Woo knew he had to take it down quickly; if not, then its scream could attract other monsters over. First, Lee Shin Woo quickly pulled out his greatsword. Jin 'jet blasted' it and quickly retreated. Immediately after, the lava around it began to boil over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kyahaaaaaaaahk!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's no 'Desert' Ghost. It's more of a Lava Ghost."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Enough with the jokes. Just focus on killing it!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Desert Ghost was pissed, as it had sustained a grievous injury on its face. It began launching its lava haphazardly. It didn't think it could catch Jin, so it hoped that if it shot lava plumes in every which way, then one of them would hit him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But against Jin, that was the worst possible choice. He didn't look for a pattern; he instead saw through the attacks with his frightening reflexes and senses in order to avoid them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kushaaaaaaaah!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Lee Shin Woo suddenly felt ominous. The fallen sand had disturbed the monsters underground; these infuriated monsters had begun to mobilize!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lv8 Solar Scarab]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Solar Scarabs were encased in shells and their wings rattled unpleasantly as they flew over. From a purely external view, they looked like stag beetles, but each one of them were more than 3 meters tall and they were obviously level 8.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo and Jin were instantly surrounded by dozens of level 8 monsters. This was an uncommon experience both underground and on the surface. If hell existed, then this was probably what it was referring to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, what are you going to do about this?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin spoke as though they could run away easily (due to his newly gained wings), but Lee Shin Woo couldn't contain his smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If we play our cards right, you may be able to reach level 8 too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I was stupid to ask."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why did he even ask, when he already knew how Lee Shin Woo would respond!? Jin sighed and felt more at ease for some reason. It felt like all those suffocating feelings he had been feeling on the surface were disappearing. He and Lee Shin Woo were the only two people here. They would combine their strength and get out of this hardship by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were both comrades who trusted each other 100%. This sense of unity could only be felt now. Everything culminated into his relaxed sense of calm. Jin knew he was distorted, as he felt relief in that. But it didn't matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'It's a disease.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin grinned and unfolded his steel wings. Even if a Pegasus were to appear, Jin was confident he could match it in flight.</span></p>
