 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It'd been three days since he'd patrolled the inner city, and this was the result he'd come to after comparing information with Jin. Hearing that, Jin was momentarily dumbstruck, but soon retorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You said those guys were the ones you needed to be most wary of. That it wouldn't be so simple; that it wasn't just knights patrolling around."</span></p>

That's what you found in your patrol too, right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That's... That's true."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had been a time that Lee Shin Woo had assumed that all high leveled magicians would be on par with Kratia. However, that wasn't the case. Kratia was the exception. Then again, she was a hero; she wouldn't be a hero if she wasn't the exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'Moreover, it's pretty obvious that their intellect went down considerably when they turned into the undead, though I'm not sure about their magic.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, there weren't that many undead that could even use magic. Even if they could, most of them could only focus on one or two spells. That's because they wouldn't be able to properly cast the spells without the calculations; the spells that they could cast were ones that they'd often used while they were still alive and were deeply instinctual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the higher leveled they were, the more they regained their abilities and intellect, so more higher leveled undead could use magic. However, the effectiveness of their magic was still a few levels down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Then what about that feminine looking undead? There's a level 6 undead in the castle."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Yeah. There is one magician in this city that I have to be wary of."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though there were few that were defending the inner city, the reason that the lord was so willing to send most of his knights to the outskirts was because he had someone he could count on in the inner city. It was none other than the level 6 Magician Leader!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Magician Leader was dreary and feminine (the fact that he could ascertain what gender she was made it clear that she was a high rank undead), and like the lord, looked emaciated. At first glance, she looked slender, but she possessed impressive magic. It was at a level that didn't trail behind Kratia's, whose magic he'd checked before they parted ways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But that just means I have to be wary of her during battle. That's all. I'm sure of it. Her communication abilities, surveillance abilities, and even her skill in basic magic searching is worse than mine. Even if she saw normal patterns that moved magic, or if I used magic to secretly provoke her, her response was always the same."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If you provoke her, she might report it to the lord!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Including all that, don't we need to see how she responds to such a provocation?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"..."</span></p>

Jin felt sick of hearing Lee Shin Woo's confident attitude. The most surprising thing was that it wasn't arrogance; that confidence always came from a thorough analysis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"And as a result of my tests, she wasn't able to sense my magic until very late, and was barely even able to sense it. Next, I released magic a few times into the air. Ultimately, it seemed as though she thought she was seeing things and returned to what she was doing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"That trait of finally sensing magic but then not really doing anything about it really fits an undead..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Right?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, no matter how powerful they were, their brains were damaged, and thus, they were idiots. Her magic's offensive capabilities were likely unquestionable, but this wasn't the first time he'd fought against a powerful opponent; Lee Shin Woo was even confident enough that he could get close to and take care of her before she could even start casting her magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"The magicians aren't really following the imperial command. The alarms in the city or the patrol routes aren't covered by magic, and their only real purpose is to act as artillery troops..."</span></p>

There's just one more thing I have to do before we can move on."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was to find their communication line with the 12 generals. If he just found it, and either destroyed or secured it, then he would have nothing to be afraid of. And now that he'd figured out that the magicians weren't all that strong, the thing he had to look out for was...</span></p>

Ah, Jin. Starting now, figure out how to covertly get into the city without being seen."</span></p>

He also wanted to take over the level 3 danger zone city as well. To do that, he couldn't just kill the lord and run!</span></p>

There were three level 6 elites in this city alone, and there also some normal level 6s on top of that... there were also hundreds of level 5s. If he added in the level 4 knights as well, they couldn't take on those numbers.</span></p>

It seemed as though the lord wasn't guarded in the least and was letting the world see his magic.</span></p>

Of course, if the other heroes knew, including Kratia, they'd be pissed. Lee Shin Woo's magical ability had developed significantly; to such an extent that they couldn't even begin to imagine.</span></p>

It was apparent that the lord's back was bent and that he was kowtowing, even through the wall. Lee Shin Woo could also observe their one-sided relationship. That must prove just how high a General's position was.</span></p>

Of course, even if he did mention him, he was still acting as though he was an undead loyal to the Empire, so it wouldn't be such a big deal. However, it was obviously much better to just pass over him than to draw attention to him.</span></p>
