Lee Shin Woo acted like he was asking for something trivial, yet it was actually an extremely brazen request; Guillotine Steelworker was astonished that he'd ask for such a thing, and muttered. He may not look it, but he had made the request after planning everything out.</span></p>

And though he wasn't moving proactively, he held no love for the curse that covered the Empire.</span></p>

He could roughly understand their situation, so he asked for a little bit of help, on the condition that they don't bother them. It wasn't a bad offer for them either, so he thought they'd have no reason to refuse.</span></p>

The reason he hadn't asked for their names was because he didn't think they'd see each other again.
