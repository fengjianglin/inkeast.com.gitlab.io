 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was more concerned about the fusion element he'd obtained. Lee Shin Woo understood the basis behind it, as well as its structure; even though he should've had everything he needed, he wasn't able to learn the fusion element with his own efforts. Yet, by absorbing the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">D<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ark&nbsp;</span></span></span>Flame Ghost's bone, he was able to gain the element without a hitch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I should've taken a hint. Since the Joker's karma allows me to imitate any and all karma. Although it's an innate element that I can't learn myself, I can still acquire it through Bone Reinforcement. It's disappointing that I can't get it past the intermediate level, but... this is good enough.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been such a long time since he'd seen the message (informing him of his own limitations) that he actually felt happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo had rebuilt all his skills, allowing him to break their limits and develop them further, but the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">D<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ark&nbsp;</span></span></span>Flame was heterogeneous and was already a completed element. Therefore, he couldn't break through the intermediate limitation imposed on the skill. Even so, Lee Shin Woo wasn't going to give up here. He already had a way of using the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">D<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ark&nbsp;</span></span></span>Flame at a level higher than intermediate.</span></p>

He wasn't stupid enough to not know what this meant. He was leveling up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh? Do you want me to just keep all this other stuff?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"In your inventory. Thanks."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gave Jin the Titan Bone Core and the two other Bone Cores just in case; he didn't want them to be absorbed while he was leveling up. Absorbing the Heaven Door's Key would only benefit him, so he kept it on his person. However, it probably wouldn't go his way. Since he didn't even know how it worked yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he distanced himself from Jin. And how did he distance himself from Jin? Using wind mana to propel himself into the air and float. He could float with ease by slightly changing the appearance of his level 7 cape, the Prayer of the Dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hey, you can fly yourself, so why did you make me do it!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're way faster and you look way cooler. And it makes it easier for me to concentrate on the battle."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Youuuuuuu!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious when you think about it. Lee Shin Woo had already given him all the gear he needed to fly, and so long as he properly controlled it, he could fly as much as he wanted. Then, why wouldn't Lee Shin Woo be able to fly, when he could use the Disguise skill that allowed him to imitate anything and everything? Whoever doubted his ability to fly was the strange one, not the other way around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lee Shin Woo calmly asked Jin to do something for him, even though Jin was so pissed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Cover me while I'm leveling up."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There existed other monsters within the level 8 dungeon aside from the <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">D<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ark&nbsp;</span></span></span>Flame Ghosts and their host. All sorts of monsters gathered, due to the immense energy the dungeon was emitting; of these remaining monsters, most of them were monsters like the Solar Scarabs.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lee Shin Woo was preventing the two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">D<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ark&nbsp;</span></span></span>Flame Ghosts from moving, so it wouldn't be strange for the monsters laying in wait to come for them now.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a teary face, Jin nodded his head and accepted the request. Then, Lee Shin Woo let go of the rampaging mana within him so he could proceed with the level up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the wind mana disappeared, his body naturally remained afloat. His body was covered in a deep darkness and soon, the surrounding environment was stained in darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never needed Jin's protection. At this very moment, no one would be able to find Lee Shin Woo, nor would they be able to attack him. It was similar to Metafel Rerdan's invincibility state when he was leveling up.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo had somewhat expected this to happen, as he had gained a deeper understanding of his Disguise skill. He would eventually overcome the limitations of life and death, and even overcome the limits of all creation. He knew he would be reborn and that the only term that could describe him would be a 'concept'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As evidence, he had overcome the livings' limitation of 'breathing'; moreover, he'd overcome the limitation of the undead: 'bones'. He hadn't lost them. He had transcended them. Lee Shin Woo could do so at any time, and there was no need for him to obsess over them anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now he didn't need to breathe to dominate his surroundings.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the bracelet he'd gotten off of Ethan Cruz, the level 7 bracelet, Everlasting Night. It sharply increased the potency of one's darkness magic, but he hadn't been able to change it into bone thus far, so he'd equipped it and forgotten all about it. However, he hadn't thought he'd be able to absorb it through his understanding of the Darkness element, rather than through Bone Reinforcement!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This level up felt truly bizarre.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Everlasting Night did the same; it melted into him and they became one.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the process of absorbing the Everlasting Night, Lee Shin Woo had finally reached the summit of his darkness element. It was only natural when he thought about it. Lee Shin Woo was born as a skeleton, so he had a high affinity with darkness at birth. Thus, it made sense that the first element that he mastered was the Darkness element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had reached its peak, he no longer needed the Everlasting Night's amplification ability. He definitely came out ahead if he were to weigh the pros and cons. Because he'd absorbed the artifact's abilities completely, his Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills had leveled up, despite them just recently doing so. He was happy about that. Of course, his evolution hadn't stopped there.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It made sense that Assimilation leveled up too. Since the Assimilation skill didn't just refer to his assimilation with Jin, but his assimilation of the world as a whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood the darkness and himself better, so he could now melt into the world; therefore, his Assimilation had leveled up. Perhaps Assimilation was far greater than Lee Shin Woo had imagined. He was really happy when he thought it might be connected to his Joker karma.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Conversely, his Combat Sense skill had leveled up for a more simple reason. His senses had improved dramatically compared to before, so his skill had followed suit and leveled up. Stats were one of the best indicators of one's combat ability, so with this, he could tell just how much he'd grown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then, a wave came crashing down that would prove incomparable to his Combat Sense's growth. He had understood the Joker's essence, reached the peak of the Darkness element, had awakened the Dark Shadow element, and had become a level 8... Because he had become so much more, he was able to attain this new skill!</span></p>
