It had only been dozens of years since, yet the sturdy bricks and cement, and the houses formed of a material foreign to them had mostly fallen apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The undead curse not only transformed living beings into the undead, but also withered away and killed anything that was still alive, so it was only natural that the city was in this state. It truly was a curse that killed the world itself. Whenever he looked at it this way, he realized how frightening the curse actually was.</span></p>

The cities they'd passed by until now didn't have an assortment of goods, but this unknown city, possessed huge walls, a commercial district, as well as a slum area.</span></p>

Rather, most of them were level 1 undead. They didn't really have any special features and the only piece of information that appeared was [Lv1 Skeleton]. If they were still human, they probably would've shown up as [Lv1 Human].</span></p>

Lee Shin Woo could understand how he was feeling. That's because the skeletons were haggling over a valueless rock.</span></p>

But despite being tricked by Lee Shin Woo, they definitely understood that they had become skeletons and moved accordingly. Just that was enough to make them look 'normal'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I've restored their egos and have even given them a name; I really am like their savior."</span></p>

At the beginning, he wondered why Lee Shin Woo had set the skeletons free, but he'd ultimately turned them into his subordinates once they seemed like they would be useful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lee Shin Woo's fickleness was truly frightening. The only thing he was sure of was that Lee Shin Woo would always be true to himself. It felt a bit awkward thinking about it any further, so he decided to change topics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"...Is killing them the only way to save them?"</span></p>

They're already dead. Even if you talk to them, they probably don't even remember their names."</span></p>

Whenever Lee Shin Woo would say something like this, Jin would admire him a bit, but he didn't really want to accept that Lee Shin Woo had more knowledge or wisdom than him when he was already stronger than him as well, so he didn't say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There're a lot of level 1s here, but it's not a danger level 2 zone for nothing. The closer we get to the center of the city, the more tightly-guarded it'll be, so focus on your connection with me."</span></p>

Both of them knew the same skill, so it was easy to raise the effectiveness of his skill through their connection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Through the connection from the Horseback Riding skill, the Stealth skill’s effectiveness increases. In special situations, the skill proficiency rapidly increases.]</span></p>

The shadows cast by the ruined buildings easily concealed them, and they observed the city, as if they were memorizing every facet of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We shouldn't even worry about the level 2 ones, right?"</span></p>

We don't need to count them if they're not even level 3 elites."</span></p>

That's how Lee Shin Woo had thought in the past. However, that was something that only applied to Earth. Even if thousands of level 3 golems came rushing at him right now, he was confident that he could take them all on without even breaking a single bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was the fact that there was an overwhelming disparity between their stats, but also because undead possessed the special characteristic of never physically tiring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'And that's also the same for skeletons, as well.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that also meant that there was a high possibility that he would be helpless against a higher leveled undead. Those were the ones that Lee Shin Woo had to find and kill first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wouldn't have been too difficult for them to just straight up attack them since they had the level 6 magician, Kratia, but since she would reduce their contribution, they had moved quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'Honestly, I wanted to take my time and look around, as this is the first city that seems big enough to be called a city.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had pretty much finished up clearing the outskirts of the Empire, so now it was time to deal with the danger level 2 zones. It wasn't a bad idea to go through the cities and ascertain their levels while they still had the assistance of a level 6 magician. Though of course, each city would have their own specific circumstances...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">'There are a lot of knights. There're at least ten skeleton knights above the walls, and there are five knights that periodically go on a patrol. And there are thirty of them on standby in shifts inside of their private barracks...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a hero were acting alone, they would likely feel terrified at around this time. Because they only had one life, they wouldn't have been able to boldly infiltrate the city like Lee Shin Woo, and they wouldn't even dream of attacking the city by themselves.</span></p>
