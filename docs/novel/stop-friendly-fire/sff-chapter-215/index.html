 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was nurturing the paladins and the priests, he was still required to come forward at times. It was no ordinary dungeon; it was an elite dungeon. Not only were the monsters that appeared within this limited, enclosed space huge, but a level 7 elite monster would appear whenever it felt like they were progressing smoothly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed. However, so much time has passed since this dungeon was formed that..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd already experienced it in the Underground Empire, so he knew just how rare high level dungeons were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But contrary to the Underground Empire, where heroes actively conquered dungeons in order to kill the undead (who ran rampant due to the curse), as well as the Undead Emperor who ruled over them, no one on the surface would seek dangerous monsters or dungeons, so long as no significant harm came from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And by neglecting these dungeons for hundreds of years, it came as no surprise that elite level 7 monsters, as well as a high level dungeon (or two) would appear... That's why Lee Shin Woo was able to enter the level 7 dungeon without any competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They must've grown as time passed. S-Sir Kay! We cannot defeat this scorpion alone...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tch."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo cut through all the bothersome Sun Scorpions with his greatsword, ran towards the paladins and priests, and confronted the Solar Scorpion King one-on-one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was its body almost 5 meters tall, but its body was also covered by a tough, red outer shell. If he wanted to pierce through its exoskeleton and inflict damage, then he'd have to put in some work.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But its greatest weapon, its fire, wasn't working. It shot a yellow flame at him as if it were taking the initiative, but Lee Shin Woo just absorbed it with his greatsword. That wasn't all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Zenon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I got it.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He called, and Zenon settled into his greatsword. Lee Shin Woo hadn't consumed him with his greatsword's Fire Eater ability. Zenon simply dwelled within his greatsword temporarily. But that 'temporary' effect was quite immense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The Lv7 Fire Dragon's Scale Greatsword is temporarily reinforced. You now have the ability to command all fire.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The Soul Seeing Eye skill has become Lv3. All stats have increased by 5.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd only realized he could do this due to his contract with Sinea... To be exact, it was because of the Soul Seeing Eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name of this skill couldn't be taken at face value, as it not only increased his understanding of souls and anything related to souls but also made it easier to control said souls. It was the same for transferring spirits to items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He needed to look more into the fusion among mana, the soul, and matter, but to sum it up, if a spirit was compatible with a certain item, they could be infused into said item. And the compatibility between Zenon, a fire lizard, and the Fire Dragon's Scale Greatsword was obviously quite good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Combining with my sword is already this effective, so what'll happen if he combines with the Titan Bone Golem?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that it was nothing more than a temporary power-up, but he still wanted to try it at least once. The Titan Bone Core was already fully charged. Lee Shin Woo could start it up whenever he wanted, but...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I'll leave it be just in case.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo stared at the scorpion before him. After its initial assault had failed, it seemed to become more cautious, as it had stepped back and watched him... No, that's not what it was doing. It was actually gathering a frightening amount of mana at the end of its tail. Lee Shin Woo yelled instinctively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's a Solar Beam!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kugyaaaaa!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo marveled at its 'Solar Beam'; at the same time, the Scorpion King screamed and thrust its tail at him! Unfortunately, it wasn't an actual solar beam. It gathered as much heat as it could in one place (the end of its tail) and swung it around like a mace; Heat Smash would be an apt name for it. A hammer of fire that threatened to smash through any defense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heuaaaahp!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Lee Shin Woo avoided its strike, then the entire area would be caught aflame. As they were deeply assimilated, Jin could read his thoughts. Jin let out a battle cry and kicked off the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo pulled his greatsword back with both hands and then swung it directly at the scorpion's tail in midair. The sound of their collision resounded throughout the entire dungeon, and all those who were fighting flinched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kyahahk!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment his greatsword and its tail came into contact with each other, the condensed heat at the end of its tail strangely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scorpion hadn't expected that, yet it didn't let that bother it and tried to push him back. However, that was its biggest mistake. Its tail had lost both its heat and the force behind it, so Lee Shin Woo's greatsword just cut through it easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dirty bodily secretions spurt out, but before they could spread, Lee Shin Woo evaporated it all with heat. The scorpion felt immense pain, temporarily halting both its thoughts and its movements. All it was allowed to do was scream in agony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kishaaaaaahk!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Heup!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whereas, Lee Shin Woo relayed his intent to Jin once they landed. Jin changed his stance and prepared to jump again. Lee Shin Woo was amazed, as it felt like he and Jin moved as one. Then, the High Rank Assimilation skill leveled up. It had been quite some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The High Rank Assimilation skill has become Lv2. Agility and Magic have increased by 10.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Assimilation skill leveled up, and the two matched their breathing (though the undead couldn't breathe). Then, they leaped beautifully, as if they had truly become one, and Lee Shin Woo swung his greatsword using the momentum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sight of them cutting through the rampaging and tail-less scorpion's head to stomach was akin to the creature with a human's upper body attached to a horse's lower body: a Centaur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have acquired 5,192,430 Perium.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have acquired the Lv7 Solar Scorpion King's fire tailbone.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only swung his sword twice: once to cut off its tail, and the second to cut through its head. Contrary to its status as an elite level 7 monster, it had died quite pitifully. The paladins and priests, who had just barely defeated the scorpions and turned back towards Lee Shin Woo, saw that scene and spoke in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I knew you were strong, but..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"To think you'd finish it with just two swings of your sword."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I can't even begin to imitate his horsemanship. It felt like they became one."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hm."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Lee Shin Woo was just as surprised as they were. There was a huge difference in stats between a normal level 7 monster and an elite level 7 monster, with a huge difference between their skills as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, the primary skill that increased Lee Shin Woo's offensive and defensive abilities was his Rule of Bone skill. When one becomes an elite, they gain a unique attack skill and a buff skill like Rule of Bone. In effect, there would be a huge difference between a normal level 7's attack/defensive power versus an elite level 7's, so much so that it was difficult to consider them both level 7.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the primary reason why elite level 6 monsters could be more powerful than normal level 7 monsters. However, he'd killed an elite in just two swings of his greatsword. If he'd used Bursting Thunder as well, then he'd probably have managed to kill it in one. It made no sense, no matter how much stronger he'd gotten. If that's the case, then...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Zenon, did you feel anything?'</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Aha. I felt the mana when we clashed, but I thought it was nothing and ignored it. So that's what it was.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood immediately. Not only had he nullified his enemy's attack, but also nullified its shield as well. As a result, he was able to cut through it easily. Lee Shin Woo felt a bit sorry for the Solar Scorpion King.</span></p>

He had been hopeful, as it was the loot of a level 7 elite, but its tailbone was no different than an agglomeration of several normal Sun Scorpions' tailbones. He wouldn't be able to reinforce the Titan Bone Golem with this.</span></p>

No, it wasn't really 'drawing' the sand in. It was from hot wind. An artificial, powerful flow of air was added to the heat to create it.</span></p>
