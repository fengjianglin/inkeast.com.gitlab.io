 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they ate the golems whole, he didn't receive any Perium, any metal (it probably transformed into bone), or any golem cores.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo felt a little guilty, since they retained their title of 'Chi Paul', despite no longer being Chimeras, and checked how they felt. When he asked them about it, they responded with 'We like this name, since it's the name you gave us, Father!', which only made him feel even guiltier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You manipulated a battlefield containing the 12 Generals as you pleased and attained victory.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have acquired the title, 'Compass Breaker' and all stats have increased by 30! Strength has increased by an additional 50!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why do I feel like these titles keep getting more and more chuuni? Although I like how much they raise my stats."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...I got the title, 'Witch who Challenges Time', and my Magic and Agility increased by 30. It's strange. The 'level' of your titles are very different, Shin Woo."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one thing that was fortunate for him. When he'd killed the Golden Shadow General, Vellun Von Dorthe, only Jin and he had gained the hero rewards, but killing Arema Steelworker had yielded rewards for Kratia as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were still some rewards left that only Lee Shin Woo could obtain... He was referring to the princess that was blinking her eyes beside him. Did her eyes still hurt a little bit? Lee Shin Woo took out a handkerchief for her to wipe her tears, but then a message appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have made one of the 12 Generals, the Lv8 Spirit General, Dana Von Etliber into your loyal subordinate, and have released her from the clutches of the undead curse. This is a greater achievement than simply killing one of the 12 Generals. This act will cause your enemies to quake in fear while also raising the morale of your allies. All stats have increased by 100. You have acquired 20 permits to God's secret shop. Proficiency in all combat-related skills increases significantly!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Isn't it because that was your reward for creating a new species, rather than killing one of the 12 Generals?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ha. God's being generous."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following the battle, Lee Shin Woo's stats increased significantly, which resulted in his body undergoing a change; he closed his eyes gently and smiled (he'd already returned to his human form).</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if God were actually here then she'd feel awkward, as there wasn't much more that she could really do for him. Though his means were truly wicked, he'd managed to kill two level 8 members of the 12 Generals (one of them being a spy from the surface with his own secret plan) and made another his subordinate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd done what none of the heroes had been able to do before all in one spot. Even he didn't know how to feel about it, but in terms of results, he was a real hero.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah, shall we eat the bones we couldn't eat before? ...Jin, you want them?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm good! I'm fine now!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the bones weren't anything special, besides the Golden Shadow's leg bone. His bone was worth absorbing. With his High Rank Combat Sense skill leveling up, Lee Shin Woo's stats increased by a little more than 120.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, by absorbing his darkness knife, Lee Shin Woo was finally able to able to summon weapons imbued with the darkness element! Moreover, they were more perfect than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...It seems like you've gotten even further away from me, Shin Woo."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He's always like this. It seems like whenever you blink, this happens."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So he was always such an exceptional individual. I understand."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unbelievable; it hadn't been long since he'd leveled up, yet he was close to 20,000 total stats at 19,945. He'd given up on getting to level 9, as he'd felt it would be impossible, but at some point, the road to getting there had shortened significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd grown so much quicker than before, so he tilted his head in confusion. But in a way, it was only natural. When he'd become level 8, he'd been doing the 'unexplainable' on a regular basis, causing his karma to skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I still need to increase my stats by about 6,000... It'll probably be difficult to get to level 9 before fighting the Emperor. Beating him should be a piece of cake if I reach level 9."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's what you call greed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I hope the Emperor doesn't come over here right away."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they'd just shot and created a huge blast at the capital. Kratia felt like they should run away ASAP, but Lee Shin Woo firmly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You really think the Emperor could get out unscathed from that big of a blast? He can't respond right away. Moreover, there's the matter of his troops. At least 20% of his troops should've been vaporized by that blast."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Probably not, Hero."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surprisingly, Dana was the one who retorted. She folded the handkerchief, placed it within her chest, and spoke calmly. He had no idea why she was calling him 'Hero'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The capital's thorn wall is on a completely different level than the one here. It's because the source of darkness mana is in the capital. Moreover, my father... the Emperor may have done something to it after becoming an undead. So your beam shouldn't have cut down their troops."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's that powerful...?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Regardless of how powerful the defense, troops level 5 or less would've been destroyed. However, low-leveled enemies are meaningless against us."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, assuming she were right, there were only elite level 6 troops or higher left in the capital. He was wondering why he hadn't gotten a message notifying him of some extraordinary feat, but if the capital's defenses were that thorough then it made sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Then we have to just be satisfied with them not getting any stronger."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoo, hoo... You weren't listening, Hero."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then, for some reason, Dana smiled meaningfully. At that moment... a message appeared in front of Lee Shin Woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have completely destroyed the capital's thorn wall, as well as the rest of its physical and magical defenses! You are the first to achieve such an incredible feat! Now your enemies will have to face the heroes in the open. The final battle is approaching!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have acquired the title, 'Shield Breaker'! You have acquired the special passive skill, 'Soul Strike' MAX. All your physical and magical attacks gain 10% true damage. Your attacks ignore your opponent's defenses, resistances, properties and inflict true damage onto them! You have fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to achieve the light and darkness fusion element!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It seems like you've achieved a feat. It makes sense. You unleashed such light. The thorn wall must have collapsed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It wasn't just the thorn wall. I destroyed all of the capital's physical and magical defenses too. So this is what you were talking about..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo felt like he'd been struck by lightning. In other words, rather than reducing the capital's troops, Dana was...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you're saying it's more important that the blast eliminated all the capital's defenses."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's correct. My father was always more talented in defense, rather than offense. The capital's thorn wall was considered an 'absolute defense', and although he's been trapped in the capital for so many years, my father has drawn more power from the source to perfect the defense. Yet you destroyed it so... Hoo, hoo. It was quite a delightful blast."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thorn wall, an obstacle that lay beyond the 12 Generals, had been destroyed, so now the heroes could invade the capital freely. When he thought about it, it was truly ironic. He'd used the very weapon the Emperor had prepared to get to the surface to destroy his defenses!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And because of that, he'd gained the 'Soul Strike' skill in preparation for the final battle, so Lee Shin Woo didn't have any complaints. Moreover, this skill 'smelled' like an authority, just like his innate elements. The fact that he'd fulfilled a portion of the conditions necessary to acquire the light and darkness fusion element was proof of that. It meant that there was more to pursue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I can't really deny it anymore. Jeez. While the talented heroes were fighting against the Demon King, I was just trying to find a way to be human again, so how did it turn out like this?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn't matter; it didn't change anything. There was no reason to hide the fact that he'd fired the cannon anymore. He'd provoked the Emperor for sure, and he'd have to give it everything he had to keep himself alive. The Lich who'd lost his body once before was still out there too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...Wait a sec.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought back to the recent battle and recalled something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What was Seagald Von Retadane even trying to do here?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wasn't he trying to recruit his little sister? He perfected the Anti-Skull process by watching the Pauls and led her here to..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No, that's not it. He didn't come here for just Seira. He came here for this cannon too... What's the original name again? Heaven Rending Cannon? He was trying to do something with this too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Maybe he was trying to shoot it at the capital to strengthen the Emperor."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No way."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that were his intention, then he wouldn't have gone about it like this. He would've sworn his allegiance to the Emperor and...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He realized all of a sudden. When he thought back to how he used the Heaven Rending Cannon, then the answer became simple. He knew what Seagald had intended to use the cannon for. It was similar to what he'd used it for!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The Anti-Skull test... The Anti-Skull test's objective is...?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Resisting the undead transformation... No, that's not it. It's to make sane undead."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What happens if they're sane?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"They'll try to invade the surface... Ah."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin realized it too now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shin Woo, is Seagald...?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo clicked his tongue and nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That bastard. By mixing his mana into the Heaven Rending Cannon and firing it at the capital, he was trying to convert all of the imperial forces into Anti-Skull... He would lead the Emperor and invade the surface!"</span></p>
