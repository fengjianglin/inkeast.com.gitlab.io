 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Bayran."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bayran was located in the level 4 danger zone and was an extremely large city, which led directly to the capital. He knew he needed to go there eventually. But to think that Arema Steelworker was going over there... This was obviously no coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Arema Steelworker, huh."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That's correct. You already knew that their movements were unusual following our last great battle. We've also seen the Emperor's forces and the Anti-Skull fight in a few small skirmishes, but...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Did they make any suspicious moves after that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yes. Arema Steelworker and some golems, which emitted a strong energy, appeared where you said they would, and we've confirmed that they're moving in a particular direction. It's the route to Bayran.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...As I thought. Good work. It's important info. But you mentioned that their movements weren't particularly hidden?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yes. ...They moved so conspicuously that I suspect it was on purpose. Please take that into consideration.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could trust in the Chimeras' and their hostility towards Arema Steelworker, but something smelled off with their info...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was Arema Steelworker acting now, when he had been so quiet thus far? According to the information he'd procured on the surface, Arema Steelworker wasn't the type to take risks against the Undead Emperor. Moreover, he's showing himself and going to Bayran? That was way too suspicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'That guy's objective might be the heroes instead.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was progressing as the Magic Emperor wished. However, all of the heroes were currently underground and attempting to overthrow the Undead Emperor. A few of the 12 Generals had been killed, and killing the Undead Emperor had become an actual possibility. Perhaps Arema Steelworker was wary of the heroes interrupting his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not, then perhaps he was trying to eliminate them in case they posed a threat to the surface... No, that was unlikely. Since Arema Steelworker should have in-depth knowledge regarding the underground barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'If it's none of those options, then there's only one possibility left... He may be trying to kill the Heaven Defying General.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Paul Zero, or the Heaven Defying General was considered the 'hottest potato' underground. They didn't know where the Heaven Defying General would pop up and he was bizarre, as he acted outside the scope of normal undead behavior. No one could tell whether the Heaven Defying General was really an undead or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...Thus, there was a high likelihood of Arema Steelworker being wary of him. Arema Steelworker's conspicuous movements must be to draw the Heaven Defying General to Bayran and annihilate his forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Let's assume this information has been leaked to the other heroes... He may be trying to get the Heaven Defying General and the heroes to meet.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo quickly organized his thoughts. And then, he smiled bitterly at the Chi Pauls, who were awaiting his orders, and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm going to Bayran. I have another mission for you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[But my lord!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's a trap, I know. He's probably trying to get us, the imperial troops, and the heroes to fight against each other. Going with a large force is a bad idea."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[That's true, but my lord, I'm concerned for your safety!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They claimed they were concerned for his safety, but they couldn't hide their thirst for vengeance that dwelled within their blazing goblin fire. If anyone other than their master, Lee Shin Woo, had ordered them not to go, then they might have fought back. Lee Shin Woo smiled bitterly and explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I bring you all with me, then they'll know I'm the Heaven Defying General. Also, you don't have to be concerned for my safety. Even if he attacks me with all four of the Four Heavenly Commanders, I can win all by myself. Of course, he could have something hidden up his sleeve, but the moment we face off head-to-head, he'll be no match for me. I'm sure of it. You see, I have a secret weapon of my own."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[A weapon...?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. Once he'd ascertained Arema Steelworker's true identity, he'd given Bisher Moon a single order through Rem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bisher Moon had fulfilled his duty and gotten Lee Shin Woo what he'd wanted. Fortunately, Bisher had passed it on to him before Lee Shin Woo had to leave the surface. So long as he had 'that', there was no chance that he'd lose to Arema Steelworker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Though I wasn't able to create a new seal that surpassed Arema Steelworker's...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The end justifies the means. What's important was that Arema Steelworker's golem army posed absolutely no threat to Lee Shin Woo. Lee Shin Woo didn't even consider him a target anymore. He was worried about the other 12 Generals interfering, especially...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Seagald Von Retadane...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the 12 Generals, who possessed the title of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Annihilation Flame</span> Sword God. He was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders. The undead who commanded the organization, Anti-Skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How would he, who researched till the bitter end so that his people didn't turn into the undead, have turned out? Would he be deluded, just like the Undead Emperor? If not, then would he be independent and free-willed like Lee Shin Woo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Perhaps my greatest foe will be him...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would Seagald have missed Arema Steelworker's movements? Unlikely. He'd even encountered Lee Shin Woo's troops, who had moved as secretly as possible. They had been quiet until now, but if they decided to act in earnest, then their mobility and information gathering wouldn't lose to any of the other factions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I suppose I won't know anything for sure until I meet him in person."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Meet who?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Anyone. This might be as big of a mess as the one on the surface."</span></p>

Just like what you've done up till now."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm just preparing myself thoroughly."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prepare yourself for the worst, ready yourself for every variable, and then make your move. This line of thinking had become even better ever since he'd gained the Wild Card skill. If Jin could read his mind, then she'd say 'so in the other words, you're going to make a mess of things from now on too.' and despair, but fortunately, she didn't possess a mind reading skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I wanted to go only after I'd gathered a few more maps.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He possessed three Bayran Inner Maps. These maps were dropped by the 12 Generals. Unfortunately, each of the three maps' contents were different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had two more maps, or even just one more, then he would be able to compare the differences among them and create a singular map, but... It couldn't be helped. He didn't have any more. Lee Shin Woo had no other choice but to arrive on site and rely on his Wild Card skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoo... Mm?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lord Paul Zero...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good grief."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo shrugged his shoulders and sighed. However, Chi Paul was looking straight at him. His gaze was so intense that it felt like lasers would shoot out of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Fine. Let's go. You have to try and get your revenge, don't you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Really!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their very essence was made up of vengeance. He couldn't stop them from coming, especially when they wanted to meet the target of their revenge so badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above all, Lee Shin Woo felt slightly guilty towards all of his undead subordinates. He thought that if his subordinates had free-will, then he'd respect it. However, that had turned out to be a lie.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Paul was a level 7 elite. Ever since he had been in Lee Shin Woo's service, he had been a level 7 elite. However, he had grown immensely, and through this recent round of Bone Reinforcement, his stats were almost at 9,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, four of the other Chi Pauls had gotten to level 7 through their recent reinforcement, so they were more than enough to take on one of the 12 Generals. If he used them well, then they would definitely be a lot of help to him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he thought about it, Lee Shin Woo's actions on the surface had been a 'one-man show'. Even his most trustworthy ally, the Pope, hadn't stepped foot onto the battlefield and was the type to show his true worth when dealing with other people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo wondered how Ye Jin Jin was doing on the surface, but soon grinned and organized his thoughts.</span></p>

Lee Shin Woo wanted to pay his respects to his seniors before the battle, and it was also meant to act as a pick-off throw. He then accessed the chatting channel.</span></p>

He'd gone through a lot, but Lee Shin Woo could say that Lloyd was, without question, the most hero-like of the heroes. After his duel with Lee Shin Woo, Lloyd had matured mentally a little bit, and had become a hero that would really suit a comic book.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt at peace somewhere in his heart, as he was able to talk with his comrades after such a long time.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He briefly pondered on the multiple scenarios that popped up in his head and just grinned. Lee Shin Woo realized that he considered the other heroes as comrades, or allies. Back then (when he had first come to the Underground Empire), he would've held his stomach in laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this had only become possible because he had become so strong than none of them could pose a threat to him.</span></p>
