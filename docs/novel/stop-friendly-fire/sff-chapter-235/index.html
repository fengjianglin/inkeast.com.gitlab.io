 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have learned the Lv1 High Rank Light element. Magic has increased by 100.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Light is one of the two great elements that govern the world. It is the power that signals the beginning, accelerates the growth and development of all creation, and is the power that allows you to reach an unreachable domain. Light dispels the darkness and possesses the power of severing relationships.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It is incredibly difficult to grasp the nature of the light element, and is not an element easily wielded. This power, which can be acquired only by severing everything, is often referred to as divine power by priests. As true divinity is something only gods can wield, the light element is not true divinity.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah, so this is how I get the light element, huh."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo perused the message a few times and was deeply moved. He hadn't shown any signs, but he'd been trying very hard to obtain the light element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd used his Bone Winged Serpent staff to reverse darkness into light, studied his Light Resistance, recollected Seira Von Retadane's powerful light and had tried to copy the mana pattern she'd used, to no avail. To put it bluntly, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he'd dumped all his free time into acquiring the light element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The fact that I did all that, but still didn't get it must mean that I don't have much affinity with the light element."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was only natural. The Light element wasn't normally obtainable by the undead, so it made sense that his compatibility with the element was at an all time low. Lee Shin Woo wasn't aware of this, but whenever the Garuda used the light element or its Shining Flame, which was mixed with the light element, it took damage, as it had degenerated into an undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, the Garuda was able to wield the high rank light element with ease, and as a result of absorbing its bone (he still had his share, the Garuda's Sphenoid Bone, but in the process of reinforcing Jin with the Wing Bone, the Sphenoid Bone had awakened as well), he was able to acquire the High Rank Light element as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If God hadn't bestowed him with Light Resistance, then even Lee Shin Woo wouldn't have been able to obtain the light element. Jin was in the same boat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Dark Flame is nice and all, but Bone Reinforcement's the best for permanent growth.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rather than researching the element by himself, it was a far more effective approach to absorb a divine bird's bone, which could wield the light element at an already high level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he kept in mind that there was a chance that he wouldn't obtain the light element from Bone Reinforcement either, but he got lucky. Since he'd been yearning for the light element ever since he'd acquired the darkness element, he felt like he'd just completed a high rank quest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'It makes sense that I got the element, but it's really surprising that Jin did as well. It might've been the best time for her to level up. If not, maybe my Joker karma affected her?'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, humans (all of mankind, excluding monsters) couldn't wield the elements themselves. Even if they could, it would be the result of processing natural mana, or through a special skill or spell. Which meant that they would have to go one step higher from the middle. However, Jin had acquired the light element regardless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were several reasons as to why she did. Lee Shin Woo's Joker karma could've affected her, or perhaps Jin gained a deeper understanding of magic and her limits were released as she leveled up. If not, then perhaps Jin was considered a monster, rather than a human being now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had one more idea, but if he said it, Jin would definitely hit him, so he just thought about it. Since Lee Shin Woo wouldn't be able to look at Jin for a while!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Now that I think about it, the Emperor used a high rank element with ease. Maybe the difference between man and monster becomes meaningless when one passes level 8.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had reached level 8, Lee Shin Woo had reached the peak of the darkness element. And because of his innate skills, he could 'define' himself however he wished, so it felt like he was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He accepted it and nodded his head. Lee Shin Woo looked at Jin, who was flying with her steel-covered wings and tried using his light element again. It had been so hard getting it, yet once he did, it was so simple to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he could already control cause and effect through his Shining Flame and other innate skills, so Lee Shin Woo didn't feel that the light element, which 'severed relationships', was very appealing to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Though I suppose it's useful in healing, growth and development, or attacking at an incredibly fast speed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo glimpsed to the side again. Jin, who'd become accustomed to flying with only her wings, used light mana as an auxiliary propulsion system... she was trying to fly even faster with those 'boosters' of hers and managed to top her previous max speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn't able to control her speed 100%, so she collided with objects here and there. He decided to ignore the fact that her doing so was causing the underground cave to reach its limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Uaaaaah! It's too fasssssst!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sorry, Jin. I can't understand you at all."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Befitting the skill God had bestowed upon her, Jin had truly become a Child of Light. She could reach light speed now! He was so jealous! But it wasn't in his character to just stay jealous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah. There should be several innate elements that are derived from the light element."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Lee Shin Woo possessed the Beginner Shining Flame already. Of course, this was created from the divine bird's karma, so Lee Shin Woo could only advance it to the intermediate level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lee Shin Woo knew that there had to be a high rank derivative of the light element or even a fusion innate element. The message that described the light element had been extremely suspicious. It would allow him to reach an unreachable domain... This must not be referring to learning the light element itself, but what lays beyond it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Now that I think about it, when I was first affected by the light element, my Holy Resistance reacted, resulting in the creation of Light Resistance. Which means...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the holy element was an innate element that was derived from the light element...? No, it might even be a fusion element with the darkness element. With that in mind, Lee Shin Woo felt his heart pound (he was still in his human form).</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he couldn't try it out right now. Just because he knew that he could combine the two elements and create an innate element didn't mean that he could just be like 'how about I give it a go?' and combine them so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Innate elements required, above all, karma that suited them. The resulting change in the element would follow. So, Lee Shin Woo was merely at the starting line now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If for no other reason..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo raised the remaining sphenoid bone. It was fine if he didn't get much from it. If the Shining Flame was reinforced, then... that would be fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Absorbing the Lv9 Garuda's Sphenoid Bone. Strength and Health have increased by 130, Agility by 200, and Magic by 250. The High Rank Light element has become Lv4 and Magic has increased by 60. The Beginner Shining Flame element has become Lv5 and Magic has increased by 20. The Soul Seeing Eyes skill has become Lv5 and all stats have increased by 10. The Mana Acceleration and Mana Bone skills have become Lv8, and Magic has increased by 40. You have learned the special passive skill, Manatization. Health and Magic has increased by 20.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...He thought, but he gained something else entirely. Manatization. Lee Shin Woo had a feeling as to what it was when he obtained the skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought back to the Garuda's body, he knew the answer. It had made half its body into mana. That ability had become a skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'A level 9 indeed. An unimaginable skill just pops up out of nowhere.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo closed his eyes and thought. He was already somewhat capable of turning his body into mana. As a result of reaching the peak of the darkness element, he could temporarily turn his body into darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this skill, Manatization, was similar but also fundamentally different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This skill is... permanent.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Garuda was almost half spirit. It had attempted to transcend the limitations of its physical body and soul by turning its body into mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In lieu of that though, the Manatization skill would transform his body into mana. To be more specific, it would replace all his stats: Strength, Agility, and Health, etc. with Magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could he call it artificially becoming a spirit? Was it a natural development for him... No, he supposed it was only one of the many possibilities of maximum growth for one who understands the principle behind magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'But this skill... There are a lot of things I'm concerned about.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, turning his body into mana wasn't without its weaknesses. The spirits' physical strength wasn't very good.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cold sweat trailed down his back. He could already 'define' his existence however he wished, and change it whenever he needed to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, even if he trains the Manatization skill and changes all his body into mana, he could immediately change his body back whenever he wanted! To be blunter, he, who had focused most of his stats in Magic, had become able to redistribute his stats at will!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even he thought this was a cheat skill. Combining his ability as a Joker and the Manatization skill was far too dangerous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that's precisely why he was drawn to it. If Lee Shin Woo switched between his mana body (in other words, an evil spirit) and his physical body, then he could respond with the appropriate form during battle. Perhaps that was, in its own way, a 'perfect form'...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Changing his body into mana meant that he would be changing his bones into mana as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could cause a fundamental change in his bones by training his Manatization, then wouldn't it fundamentally change his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, and Bone Armory? Perhaps he could raise them to an even higher level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was only speculation for now, but Lee Shin Woo realized that his Manatization was the key to evolving his skills. if he were to train this skill, which changed everything he was into mana, then he would ultimately transcend matter and magic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Lord Garuda, thank you so much. If I get to level 10, then it's all because of you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo genuinely thanked the dead Garuda. If it knew, it would probably be really pissed, but fortunately, there weren't any problems on that front, since its soul had been burnt away as well.</span></p>
