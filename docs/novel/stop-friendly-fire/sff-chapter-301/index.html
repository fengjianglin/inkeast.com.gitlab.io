 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Let's turn back time a little bit to when Lee Shin Woo had come across the source of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lv10 Source of Darkness - Lich Emperor's Life Vessel]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he'd placed his hands upon the source of darkness, Lee Shin Woo came to a realization. That no one individual could bear this by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The level 9 Undead Emperor hadn't stored this here and used it as his life vessel for no reason. He'd done this&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">because</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;no one could handle it. He had given up on controlling it and had used it as his life vessel instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I prepared myself for this, but... Shit, this is way too much!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What's worse, there was an even bigger problem. Once Lee Shin Woo had approached it, the source of darkness recognized him and began unleashing a torrent of mana towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It must've been affected by his maxed out darkness element. However, that wasn't good for him right now. The source of darkness was so much stronger than Lee Shin Woo. If it kept unleashing its mana, then Lee Shin Woo's body would disintegrate. It wasn't on the level of Manatization. He would just become mana itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shin Woo, Shin Woo!?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't assimilate with me! You'll die!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Eut!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo screamed in anguish, and Jin froze solid. But she wouldn't condone his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What am I supposed to do if you die!? Then I really will die... You have to keep your promise and turn me human again!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I won't die right away. I can handle it with Invisible Heart. But you can't! Your revival relies on darkness!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ugh...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was absolutely right. Jin had gone completely stiff. In the midst of that, Lee Shin Woo tried to absorb the source of darkness whole without getting sick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tried using his Manatization, Mana Acceleration, and Mana Bone skills to control the flow of mana, as well as all of his innate elements to twist cause-and-effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it didn't work at all. It was only natural! Ultimately, what it came down to was that all elements were controlled by mana! The pure darkness mana demolished all logic and cause-and-effect, and flooded Lee Shin Woo's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Uaaaaaah! It hurts and it stings! But it's also relaxing and feels good... Damn it, I really will die at this rate! It's like I'm right about to lose consciousness atop a mountain!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The term 'source' was truly a fitting title for it. It was indeed the source of all darkness in this world. It felt as though half of this world was within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Absorbing it by himself? What a joke. It was like taking in half of the world's population; it was impossible from the very start. Lee Shin Woo had miscalculated. It was a crucial miscalculation at that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Then what am I supposed to do? If I don't do something about this, then I can't kill Jissehanu!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jissehanu had already begun using this as his life vessel. To completely eliminate the undead curse, Lee Shin Woo had to kill him, and to do that, he needed to destroy his life vessel as well. He hadn't had any other choice from the very start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then why!? He'd dealt with any absurdity his own way thus far, but he wasn't able to deal with this one! No, if something like this actually existed, then God should've given him some warning beforehand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What if I turn into a Titan? I may be able to contain all of this overwhelming mana... No, that's not enough.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were to use the Titan, then he'd only be switching his small soy sauce bowl for a soup bowl. He needed to absorb half the world itself, so it wouldn't make much difference. On the contrary, by increasing the size of the medium, he might actually find it harder to control the mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'There's a solution somewhere. There has to be. If I were to fuse the innate elements together, then... Heaven Space? Dark Shadow? Use Annihilation Flame to sever the link? What if I were to eliminate the mana with Shining Flame as soon as I acquire it...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, it wouldn't work. That would only work when Lee Shin Woo was in control of the darkness mana in question; it wouldn't work since he couldn't control this mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was reversed. Lee Shin Woo wasn't the master of this mana. Rather, the source of darkness was. The source of darkness was eating Lee Shin Woo, not the other way around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the Titan? If he had, then it would've been a huge issue. Right now, the Titan Core was composed of the Demon Heart that originated from the Evil Eye ore; the Demon Heart had come from the source of darkness itself. If he'd used the Titan, then he would've been devoured in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was really out of options. The Undead Emperor's security hadn't been lax; there had been no need for security in the first place. No, the fact that Jissehanu had managed to process such a great artifact and use it as his life vessel proved that he was a genius. A man extraordinary enough to aim for the surface!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What do I do? How do I go about this? What do I have to do to absorb all this mana? It's not possible unless I were to become a god! It's just way too much for me to absorb...!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despair would always arise without a moment's notice. And there usually wasn't any way to deal with that despair. Lee Shin Woo recollected his long past death on Earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yeah. This is what despair felt like when one was at the cusp of death. It had been such a shocking affair that Lee Shin Woo had asked God for immortality. He'd forgotten all about his original personality, beliefs, and skills, and pursued such a childish dream instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, he was able to progress this far, which was shocking to him, but... ultimately, he was faced with despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This is unfair.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything's unfair. Everyone he'd met must've thought that Lee Shin Woo was unfair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This is absurd.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything's absurd. Whenever he'd been faced with an absurd situation, he'd dealt with it with an equally absurd solution, so he really had no leg to stand on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'What's worse, I can't trick this thing.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tricking someone required that they have the minimum emotions, will, or what-not. However, the source of darkness didn't have any of those. The reason this thing was emitting mana was purely because darkness was there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could understand how mountain climbers felt. There was a mountain there, so they climbed it. Though he wasn't going to actually climb a mountain or anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...I guess there really isn't anything I can do.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo acknowledged his inability. It felt as though he wasn't able to get to level 9 because he'd given up. But it couldn't be helped. Others had often called him stubborn or overpowered, but Lee Shin Woo was fundamentally still a human who followed his set criteria and logic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every situation, which changed due to his silver tongue or skills, was nothing more than an event where he calculated the rate of success and/or failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And so, the fact that he'd determined that he was out of options meant that this was truly the end. There was nothing he could do. After dying 210 times, he really would die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'However...'</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is nothing! What exactly do I have to do... Ah, that's right!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A greater miracle. The more people affected by it, the greater the penalty. God herself had explained it, hadn't she? The more she influences others' karma, the greater the penalty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Then, let's think,' Lee Shin Woo thought. What place could he enact a miracle where the most people would be affected? It was obvious! It was none other than the Setoin Plains, where the undead and the humans were fighting their very last battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Shin Woo!"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he left for the surface, Jin had rushed out of the cave with speed befitting a 'Child of Light'.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She, a skeleton horse, was in the process of changing into a human... She closed her eyes at her truly miraculous transformation and at the end of it, had turned into a true human. She opened her eyes, saw Lee Shin Woo, and was able to move. Of course, Lee Shin Woo had already disappeared from the underground.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had instantaneously become a battle angel, like the ones who came from North European myth, a Valkyrie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin meticulously looked over the joints of her armor, and then folded the steel wings on her back...</span></p>
