  &lt;Chapter 4. Hunting Hero - 4&gt;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Treasure Eater uses Flames of Resentment! Scorching flames cover the whole area!]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Critical Hit!]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The Lv2 Treasure Eater didn’t have that skill though! But he couldn’t complain. After all, when Lee Shin Woo realized that it was a higher level, he should've been suspicious that it had an ability that the Treasure Eaters up until now didn't have.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Because he was sure he had grasped victory, Lee Shin Woo had forgotten his sense of danger and acted recklessly; it was his mistake.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'It's really a good realization. If I come out of these flames alive, it should be a profitable trade.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo didn't hold back, using all his strength in an attempt to get out of the scarlet flames that covered the chaotic battlefield no matter what. Though it wouldn't be over if he died here, he can't always rely on Invisible Heart!
 </div>
 <div>
  The fact that he'd instinctually opened his inventory and grabbed his bone arrows the moment of the explosion was truly a wise response. Even though the strength contained in each individual arrow didn't compare to the bones left behind from hunting monsters, they would at least be enough for first aid.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement! Use them all for Bone Reinforcement!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The bone arrows were completely used up, and then his body, which had been entirely burnt by the huge explosion, was instantaneously healed.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Since they were just normal bone arrows, they didn't leave behind any experiences, memories, or skills, and his stats didn't increase either, but it was enough that he had fortunately avoided an instantaneous death. Of course, he wasn't out of the woods just yet.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Bones... I need more bones!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Fortunately, the battlefield was filled with the bones of the skeletons that had died prior. However, the bones themselves were burning within the malevolent flames, so he would have to hurry up if he wanted to use them for Bone Reinforcement.
 </div>
 <div>
  It was a relief that his circumstantial judgment was quick as he was soon able to collect several dozens of bones.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Bone Reinforcement! Bone Reinforcement!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your arm bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your leg bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your shoulder bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your arm bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  He couldn't get anything more from the bones from regular Skeleton Soldiers anymore. But they would still heal him if he used Bone Reinforcement, and he saw his reddish bones barely return to their natural color.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Of course, immediately after, he saw an even stronger flame rushing towards him, and he once again found himself in a dangerous situation. It was at that moment that he realized what a calamity fire was. Even more so since they were magical flames!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Steve, you asshole...! Bone Reinforcement, Bone Reinforcement!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your arm bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your palm bone has been reinforced. Strength has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior's memories and experiences.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  [You have to slash even harder. We're the swords of the empire! - Nameless soldier.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Finally, the Skeleton Warriors' bones were starting to get mixed in. Its healing effect was even better! Lee Shin Woo's eyes gleamed and moved his body even faster. He needed to collect even more of these precious bones before they burned up!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your arm bone has been reinforced.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your palm bone has been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior's memories and experiences.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [It's pointless if you swing your sword a thousand times but not manage to cut your enemy once. Our goal is to precisely kill an opponent with only one swing. - Nameless soldier]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your palm bone has been reinforced. Strength has increased by 1. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior's memories and experiences.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [The imperial army is strong. We have to make everyone looking at us understand that. - Nameless soldier]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It seemed like he was being tested in reaction speed, and endurance at the same time.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Even if he reinforced his bones to the point that he was breathless, he didn't know whether the Treasure Eater's flame would subside or not, and even if it did, it wasn't like he could just sit there and do nothing, else he would quickly die.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Since it's come to this, he had thought about just dying once and resurrecting, but the more that came to mind, Lee Shin Woo obstinately decided to endure.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  He had already died twice. That meant that if he hadn't come to the empire without any extra lives, he would already be dead. He couldn't accept becoming dependent on that technique.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'I can't die easily... Bone Reinforcement!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Your palm bone has been reinforced. Absorbing a portion of the Skeleton Warrior's memories and experiences.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [I did it! There was magic in my sword just now! - Nameless soldier]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  He quickly sprinted through the raging flames and found bones. When he couldn't find any more bones, he attempted to escape the raging flames, but to his shock, those flames stuck to his body and didn't let go easily.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  It was almost as if the Treasure Eater's resenting will resides within the flames, gritting its teeth, and saying that it would kill him. And that wasn't a misunderstanding. The surviving flames were tightening around his neck.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Then...'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  If he didn't kill the Treasure Eater, these flames wouldn't disappear. He had realized this instinctually. The moment he was sure of it, Lee Shin Woo found the Treasure Eater and turned his body.
 </div>
 <div>
  The flames had already spread in all directions, and it was a situation where he couldn't even see properly, but the mana within these flames that stuck to his body was leading him. He himself thought it was strange that he could feel the mana, despite feeling the pain of his entire body being burned.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'It's this way.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Don't they say that if you want revenge on someone, you'd have to dig two graves? This skill was truly like that. Its Flames of Resentment was a skill that burned its opponent by using its own blood and mana as fuel. Those two things are obviously closely connected to its lifeforce and magic.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Right now, Lee Shin Woo could feel that connection. In this urgent situation, his ability was growing at an exponential rate.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv4.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  [The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv5.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Damn it!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The fact that his Magic Affinity skill had increased was definitely something to be happy about, but it was becoming harder and harder to push through the flames and run.
 </div>
 <div>
  He didn't have any more bones to reinforce himself with, his bone body burned, and he could feel his ability gradually slipping.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [The Beginner Magic Affinity skill has become Lv6.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  [The Beginner Sprint skill has become Lv8.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Sprint... Sprint!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Whenever he fought a hard battle, he only increasingly hated and regretted the him who was attached to the past.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Damn it...!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  But his health was gradually dropping, and it was at the moment he felt it drop; the moment he prepared for death and grit his teeth, the mass of mana inside his body changed his mind, and he felt it spread all across his body.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [You have learned the active skill, Beginner Regeneration Lv5]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  His bones, which felt like they would crumble, were saturated with magic and instantly returned it to a healthy state. More than anyone else, Lee Shin Woo was able to ascertain its effect. It was truly a simple skill; it would consume mana to regenerate the body! It was the same for bones!
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo was curious as to how he had learned this skill, but he didn't have the time to leisurely think about it right now. When he regained his energy, he used his Sprint and kicked off the floor, jumping into the sky!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'There you are!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo, who had briefly escaped the sea of flames, caught sight of the wriggling and moving Treasure Eater. Like him, the Treasure Eater was dying. But...
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Kuhi... Kieeek...!]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It was sitting wickedly in the center of the flames, and then widened the distance; it then moved around as if it were drawing a circle. He felt like it would wait until he died and then the Treasure Eater would collect the treasure.
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo was already pissed off, but he was also annoyed that he couldn't do anything to it right now. He was way too far from it! It was great that he had awakened the Regeneration skill at the right time, but it had the disadvantage of using up magic. This meant that he'd run out of mana before he was able to take it down.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Even so, it's not like I can shoot arrows from the sky...!'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Unfortunately, his knowledge of archery was shoddy. Even if he had the skill, he had used all of his arrows back then to heal himself!
 </div>
 <div>
  Even while he grit his teeth, his body felt the force of gravity and was falling back towards the flame scorched ground. While falling, Lee Shin Woo suddenly, without any thought, naturally raised his left hand.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [The passive skill, Beginner Archery Lv2 has been expunged.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [You have learned the active skill, Beginner Catapult Lv5.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  That feeling that he had experienced just a moment ago dominated his body. It was the feeling of awakening a skill! Following the Beginner Regeneration, he had awakened the Beginner Catapult skill!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Urgh!'&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  The brief and powerful pain accompanied his left index finger being pulled out, and just like the name implied, it shot out like an arrow. Most of the mana he had remaining was inside of that projectile.
 </div>
 <div>
  Its accuracy, as well as its speed, were incomparable to mere Beginner Archery; it cut through the air, burrowed into the middle of the Treasure Eater's forehead, and in the end, penetrated through it. Since it had truly happened in the blink of an eye, Lee Shin Woo himself couldn't track its path completely.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Gguiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiik!]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  However, the result was clear. The moment Lee Shin Woo dreadfully fell into the flames, the Treasure Eater gasped a horrific death rattle, and fell heavily with a thud.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Immediately after, the flames that had been stuck to his body, as well as the flames filling his surroundings cleanly dissipated. He stood dumbfounded and lines of messages started appearing before him.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [You have defeated a Lv3 Treasure Eater. You have achieved the feat of commanding your comrades and defeating an enemy that was at a higher level than you. All stats permanently increase by 2. You have acquired the passive skill, Command Lv1.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [You have acquired the title, 'Treasure Hunter'! Whenever you hunt monsters or explore a dungeon, it will become easier to acquire higher ranked rewards. The title box is open.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [As a reward for your feat, the proficiency of your combat related skills increases. Low Rank Bursting Thunder has become Lv2, Beginner Stealth Lv8, Beginner Shriek of the Dead Lv6, Beginner Catapult Lv6, and Beginner Command Lv3.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It was extremely hectic. He was sure that the skill he had used at the final moment was the skill he had gained from the Ratman, and he didn't think it'd have this much force.
 </div>
 <div>
  It felt really empty where he lost a finger, but he had gained the Regeneration skill just in time, so whenever he gets enough mana, he can just regain the bone.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Wait a sec, did I perhaps get the Regeneration skill from the Queen?'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo recalled the Rat Queen's ability, who had birthed the elites, and he automatically nodded his head. Regardless of how much mana it had, that number of births was rare and beyond measure. However, if it had a healing ability, he could understand that many births in that short amount of time.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Catapult, which would pull out a finger and launch it, and Regeneration which would restore that bone... who would have thought I would find such a perfect match in the same dungeon.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  In any case, he had survived because of those two skills. He thought it would've been better had they awakened a bit earlier, but... he couldn't be too greedy. Because he had moved so intensely, he had also grown.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "Hoo, then... Wow, it's a proper annihilation."
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  After he was sure that he wasn't at risk of dying anymore, he carefully stood up and surveyed his surroundings. There was nothing to survey. Since everything had turned to ashes.
 </div>
 <div>
  He couldn't find any Skeleton Soldiers' or Skeleton Warriors' bones. He did see some of the greatswords that the Skeleton Warrior's had used remaining, but there weren't any spears. Seeing that, he realized that the Skeleton Warriors were better with a sword than a spear.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "I'll pick you guys up later. More importantly..."
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  After Lee Shin Woo checked that the other Treasure Eaters' bodies had cleanly disappeared, he turned around while tears slightly flowed (even though he can’t cry). Despite him having no way of restoring them... he still had the biggest reward left.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
