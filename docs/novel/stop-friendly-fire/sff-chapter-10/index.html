  &lt;Chapter 3. Level Up - 3&gt;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo checked his status and couldn't hide his astonishment at all.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'It's not just a simple increase in stats, but it increases the effectiveness of my stats by 10%?'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  So that's why there's such an obvious, overwhelming divide between level 1 and level 2! If this kind of calculation is applied going forward, there'll be an even larger difference from level 2 to level 3, and level 3 to level 4.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  His eyes looked dazed just imagining it. He realized that he still had a long way to go. If he had known this information beforehand, he wouldn't have even thought about fighting the Zombie Hero. The only reason he could even win against it was because the damage to its body had been so severe. He had been extremely lucky.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Strength - 73 + 10 Agility - 77 + 10 Health - 61 + 10 Magic - 43 + 10] (While the dungeon bonuses still apply)
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The power of the level itself was amazing, but his stats, which had absorbed the Bone Spear, the Feather Bone Boots, and the bones that the Zombie Hero had left behind, were also quite impressive. Due to his stat bonus from dying, as well as the effect of his achievement, Bone Reinforcement had resulted in an inflation of his stats.
 </div>
 <div>
  Losing the Lv2 Bone Spear was regrettable, to the point of tears, but it had caused him to grow since it had been broken anyway.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Then how about... I have two new skills, huh.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  When he leveled up, he had acquired the skill, 'Avenger', and a skill from the Zombie Hero's memory, 'Bursting Thunder'.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Because they had such grandiose names, Lee Shin Woo was concerned that they might be all looks and no substance, but it was just an absurd misunderstanding.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Beginner Avenger Lv1 (Passive)]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Once you harbor a grudge on someone, they cannot escape. You will be buffed if you run from the battlefield, and you can find the opponent who defeated you on the minimap. When you fight that opponent again, all your abilities will increase by 20%. Every time your revenge is successful, the skill grows.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  He gained the Avenger skill on the premise that he'll lose.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It was definitely a great skill. However, it seemed like a strange skill that wouldn't have much opportunity for growth, so he was slightly lost in disappointment, but when Lee Shin Woo understood the meaning behind 'You will be buffed if you run from the battlefield', he came to his senses.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Does it mean that it's ok to run away for the purpose of revenge? If that's the case, then dying in battle isn't the only thing considered a defeat. ...It might not be such a simple skill as I had first thought.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  True, if defeat only came at the hands of a lost battle, then there would obviously be no point to this skill since not everyone has a resurrection skill.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  The method of using the Avenger skill was different from the other skills he had gained thus far and was caused by the effect of his actions. The potential growth of this skill depended on how he used it. Of course, there was still stuff he didn't know about the skill, so recognizing that there was potential in the skill was the best he could do for now.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Bursting Thunder Lv1(Passive)]
 </div>
 <div>
  [A close combat fighting style that was created by a legendary hero; after it was enhanced by God's power, this skill was born. As the greatest fighting style that includes all close combat techniques and defensive techniques that originate from unarmed combat, its power and speed are akin to exploding lightning and fatal. In order to properly demonstrate that strength, the techniques are naturally clad in magic, but this is not possible at the current level.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  On the other hand, contrary to Avenger, Bursting Thunder was an incredibly intuitive ability. For some reason, he was able to naturally understand why Spearmanship, Swordsmanship, even Weapon Defense, and Critical Hit were absorbed in the process of gaining the skill.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  It was a technique that included all close combat techniques! He didn't really need to say how amazing it was. It wasn't a technique that he could gain anywhere. By absorbing the bone that the Zombie Hero left behind, he had extracted the memories and experiences within. If it hadn't been for Bone Reinforcement...!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'For a legendary hero's ability to be enhanced by God's power. There's no way that a Lv2 hero could have created it himself, so he likely asked for this skill from God.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  When he thought about it like that, he felt like he'd scored. He'd be able to gain the abilities that God had given to the other heroes because of Bone Reinforcement! He had once again realized that that the Bone Reinforcement skill's potential was unlimited.
 </div>
 <div>
  More importantly, it was amazing that the Bursting Thunder skill was at the low rank level. This was the first low rank skill he'd obtained, and considering his achievements, he was sure that it was a high-rank skill, rather than low rank.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'Then, lastly... let's take a look at the sword the zombie left behind.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Honestly, when he defeated the Zombie Hero, he was most excited about acquiring its sword, not the level up, nor the acquisition of skills. Regardless of how experienced it was in Bursting Thunder, splitting a level 2 Bone Spear in a single strike was evidence that its weapon's ability was uncommon.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "It's over here."
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Since the Zombie Hero had already disappeared and was gone, it was easy to find the sword that was rolling on the ground. The sword gleamed in a blue light within the darkness and looked truly mysterious, so his anticipation continued to rise.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  However, the moment Lee Shin Woo excitedly grabbed the sword, something strange happened. The sword which had definitely been made of metal emitted a cracking sound and started to change!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Through the power of Bone Reinforcement, all weapons that you gain change into bone.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lv4 'Thunder Lasting' has changed into Lv3 'Bone of Thunder Lasting'.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The weapon completely transformed the moment he touched it and it became really short. The bone blade radiated a delicate blue light, and the hilt became discolored, transforming into a black bone...&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  '...Bone?'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  No, he ignored the impossibility of metal transforming into bone for now. How could a level 4 item instantly degrade into a level 3 item? What a waste!
 </div>
 <div>
  He thought everything would be good, but he didn't know that Bone Reinforcement would have such a fatal flaw. Until now, all the items he had acquired were made of bone, so he hadn't been aware of it at all!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo was momentarily lost in a state of listlessness. If he was holding a level 4 weapon right now, he would've felt invincible...!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'No wait... Damn it, get a hold of yourself. I should've expected this kind of demerit.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Moreover, it would've always been a demerit. Since Bone reinforcement would change all the weapons he acquired, he'd be able to use the weapons he wouldn't otherwise be able to use.
 </div>
 <div>
  However, if he looked at the long-term, it would definitely be an advantage. He had no choice but to think that way for now. Tears flowed from his eyes (though they really didn't) and he checked the status of the weapon that changed to bone.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Bone of Thunder Lasting]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lv3]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Durability: 750/750]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Attack Power: 100 - 120]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Options: Strength + 5, Agility + 5, Increases Effectiveness of Bursting Thunder + 10%)
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "Ugh, he probably got this from God, too."
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The abilities of the hero he had just defeated were lousy, whereas the latent potential of the Bursting Thunder skill was ridiculous; not only that, its weapon was also closely related to the skill.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  In other words, it was likely that the hero, in exchange for being dispatched to this world, asked God to give it a skill and a weapon. When he compared them to the abilities he'd gained, they seemed inferior, and aside from Bursting Thunder, there was a high possibility that the hero had gained other abilities, but he could care less since he didn't gain those abilities.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  'It's definitely advantageous to have a high level weapon at the start but... this is the result.'
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  That was the only thing worth complimenting; that the hero had given to his junior. But he'd probably forget about it soon.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Despite the weapon degrading to level 3, the Bone of Thunder Lasting boasted strength that completely outstripped the Bone Spear. He tried swinging it around, and finally sighed, ridding himself of the regret of not obtaining a level 4 weapon.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It was at that moment.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Quest complete. The chatting channel is opening.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Mr. Lee Shin Woo is entering.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Hey, what's this? A newbie came in?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: Hello, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. It should've been a hard decision to become a hero, so thank you for your bravery. Let's work hard in the future.]&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: Anyway, what level are you newbie? 5? 4? You're not level 3, are you? Please tell me you're not.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: He could start at level 3 and grow. Why are you discouraging someone who just came in?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: Damn it. That's because if you finish the start at level 3, even if you desperately try to earn Perium, the limit’s level 5. Do you know how many I've seen die like that?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: But I started at level 3 and now I'm level 6.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: You're... you're talented.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  As soon as the chatting channel was opened, a few people hectically chattered away. It was called a chatting channel, but it was more like a group chat, so it was noisy hearing so many voices in his ear simultaneously.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Despite that, he was so happy that he could hear other people talk that tears threatened to flow. To the point that he somewhat regretted that he didn't have eyes from which tears could flow.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: It's nice to meet you, seniors. Please take care of me.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The moment the chatting channel opened, he instinctively understood how to use the channel, and gently bent his left pinky finger and spoke. He spoke both reasonably and calmly, to the point where it was difficult to believe that he had become a skeleton. No wait, a skeleton talking was strange from the start.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Considering how courteous the newbie is... he'd get along well with Retadane.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: It's really nice to meet you. You're still in the outer area, right? If you find something troublesome, please tell me at any time.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: See?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu
  <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a>: So what level are you? ...Should I give you some Perium?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: I'm sorry, but why does my level or Perium matter?]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo decided to ask what he was most curious about first. He thought that by diligently killing monsters, and stockpiling stats through Bone Reinforcement he would get karma.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  However, his senior heroes were synonymous regarding Perium and levels, so he couldn't help but be curious.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu: What? Are you kidding me?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Shino, if he came out of the secret shop only buying equipment, he might not know yet.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu: Ah... is that possible? True, that's the time when you're most clueless. Sorry, newbie. I lost a comrade just a little while ago, so I'm a bit touchy.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: That's alright, I understand, senior. I was shortsighted. It seems that there are items in the secret shop that correspond to level.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  As Lee Shin Woo talked through the chatting channel, he felt a strange feeling. His personality was calmer than before, and he spoke respectfully; it felt like he had two personalities. It felt like he was wearing a mask... ah, he was using his Acting skill!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu: Fortunately, your brain's not bad. Yeah, that's it.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: That's the significance of the secret shop. You hunt the undead flooding from within the empire, acquire Perium, and then, go to the secret shop to purchase a medicine that increases your stats. Through that, we surpass our limits and are then able to do a more difficult area. At the same time, the purification of the empire progresses. It's fine, even if your level is a bit low. Since God's secret shop makes it possible for 'infinite growth potential'.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: The higher your level, the more expensive the medicine costs... Do you know how much it costs to buy a single health drug? 300,000 Perium, damn it. It'd probably be faster to achieve a feat and increase my stats that way.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu: But achieving a feat ain't easy. Alfy wanted to do that and overtaxed himself... Ha.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo was moved once he heard a senior hero lament. He was suddenly sure that his request to God wasn't wrong.
 </div>
 <div>
  Of course, he knew that they all didn't have a special characteristic like Bone Reinforcement, but he didn't know that they had to go through so much trouble just to level up. If they had to go through this much trouble, then it was worthwhile becoming bald and impotent! Probably! Please!
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: While we're on the topic, what level are you right now, Retadane?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: Isn't Mr. Lee Shin Woo more important than me right now?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: You're avoiding it again. So, newbie, what's your level?]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo was briefly silent. He had just learned new information and suddenly realized how amazing his ability was, so his mind had become busy.
 </div>
 <div>
  However, if he was sure of one thing, it was that he didn't really need to tell them that he was level 2 and cause them to despair. There was the difference between the level they would accept, and the level he would accept, and in their eyes, his growth rate would seem excessively fast in the future.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: I'm level 4.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Nice. If you're level 4, then there's still hope in this world.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: That's a relief. Then it seems like you won't hopelessly die in the outskirts.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Shino Rendu: Not bad. Hey, after you've properly armed yourself, make sure you get the medicine. Increasing your level should be your priority over everything else, your level. You already know, right?]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Since he knew they would respond like this, he exaggerated quite a lot. He didn't even know how much he had to raise his stats to get to level 4, but he went with it for now. They had responded in the way he had expected.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: Still, you're not very strong, so you probably received a special feature based on your characteristics. What did you get? You didn't ask for something like increasing your level, shooting fire, or asking for a sword, right? Please tell me you didn't.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  The abilities one receives when they cross over to Heguroa depends on how strong they were originally.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  Normally, in a fantasy world, a strong person would comparatively get weaker abilities, while a normal civilian from Earth like Lee Shin Woo would receive the greatest of abilities. That bastard Prince was asking about that right now.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: I got a skill.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: Good job! Seriously, good job!]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Your base is good. If he does well, he should become strong.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: You did well. None of the skills that God grants are normal. Yes... how can we help Mr. Lee Shin Woo right now?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Newbie, tell us about your current situation. Since we'll do what we can to help you.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Fortunately, his seniors seemed mostly amicable. He didn't know how many of his senior heroes were in the empire, but... he was slightly relieved and replied.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: I'm alright for now. If I get into a tough situation, could I please count on your advice then?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Hey, you can speak a bit more comfortably...]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Yasunori Akira: Hm, it's been a while seen we've seen a guy with some common sense. If you can safely get to the capital, I'll put you in my party then.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lloyd H.K: Akira, you're still not dead?]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Yasunori Akira: You idiot, don't call me by my name.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Even by his standards, he was extremely polite to the point he felt goosebumps! However, Lee Shin Woo was definitely weaker than his seniors right now, so he decided that he needed to thoroughly bow his head for now. Plus, he's a skeleton right now! There was nothing wrong with always being careful, regardless of who he was dealing with.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  [Prince Altania: Yeah, when the time comes, I'll give you some advice. Think of it as an honor.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Seira Von Retadane: If you always keep the chatting channel open, you won't be able to focus on the current situation, Mr. Lee Shin Woo. Please keep that in mind. I'll be praying for you to safely arrive at the capital.]
 </div>
 <div>
  [Lee Shin Woo: Thank you for the advice. Then, I'll see you later.]
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  Lee Shin Woo politely said his goodbyes and closed the chatting channel.
 </div>
 <div>
  He could no longer hear the voices that had pounded in his ears, and it felt lonely, but still, he had found a place where he could chatter whenever he wanted, so he was delighted. From now on, he felt sure that he'd be able to cope with this world.
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "Anyway, since a quest isn't coming up... it's telling me to do as I please for now."
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  It worked out well. Since he decided to clear the dungeon to adapt to his body, which had advanced to level 2, as well as his new skill, and weapon. Of course, gaining Perium and bones was his highest priority.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  "Hoo, then... shall we go?"
 </div>
 <div>
  <br>
 </div>
 <div>
  He sighed satisfyingly and took a step forward into the dungeon.&nbsp;
 </div>
 <div>
  In order to completely adapt to this world, he moved his skeleton body.&nbsp;
