 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today was the day that Lee Shin Woo would meet with the second group of Vampires and head towards the capital. He left the Metal Army base and arrived at the secret rendezvous location, but was at a bit of a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's a pleasure to meet you, Lord Arema Steelworker, the Empire's Guardian!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's an honor to meet a Steelworker!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[For the Emperor!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was, of course, no problem with the quality of the army. Two more level eight generals had come, and they were definitely more powerful than the Steel Armor General.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn't all. Though they weren't part of the 12 Generals, there were still five level 7 elites amongst the 500 level 6 elite Vampires. The Emperor truly did send his best. However...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's been a while, Arema Steelworker."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...It really has been a long time.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unknown woman acted like she knew him, with a really displeased expression at that. 'Beauty' was the most apt term for this charming middle-aged woman, but it really didn't matter to Lee Shin Woo either way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Lv8 Light General Sorura Von Lilaine - Elder Vampire]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She must've known Arema Steelworker for a long time. Lee Shin Woo had figured out her name but didn't know anything else about her, so he contacted Chi Paul and tried to get some info on her. However, he wasn't able to get much on her. What he did know was that she really wasn't a relative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You went so far as to become a golem and come down here, yet you weren't able to do anything right, let alone fulfill your mission; ultimately forcing me to come down to this wretched place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hahaha. Forgive her, Arema. Madam Lilaine is just happy to see you. She knows more than anyone how much you've sacrificed and what you've achieved here. Isn't that right, Madam?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"How ridiculous. No matter how much you've achieved in the past, it doesn't matter if you fail now. I'm so ashamed that I was once at the same level as this man."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other level 8 general was a middle-aged man, called the 'Sun Spear General Judika Von Beloduns' (he was also an Elder Vampire as well), and he likewise acted like he knew Arema, but Lee Shin Woo didn't know who he was either. They weren't suspicious of him, as he maintained Arema's basic qualities, but...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh my. It seems to me that Arema has gotten just as strong as we have. Isn't that right, Arema?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Hmph. There's nothing for me to say. You'll see soon enough.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha, you're still the same."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To think that he'd run into this kind of problem. He was briefly puzzled, but soon realized that the Emperor had sent generals with the same standing as Arema himself; they had served the Emperor just as long as he had, and they had achieved just as much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo realized this and decided to throw out a feeler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If you all came down here, then what about the surface?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Don't worry about the Emperor's safety, Arema. One of the Four Heavenly Commanders is still by His Majesty's side.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bingo! As expected, these guys were part of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He'd learned that the surface's four strongest generals were also called the Four Heavenly Commanders when he was on the surface. He hadn't known who they were, but now he knew who three of the four were. Including Arema that is.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that's how it was. Arema was part of the Four Heavenly Commanders on both the surface and underground... Even though he had died the simplest death of the Four Heavenly Commanders! He inwardly laughed, and the Light</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General, Sorura Von Lilaine furrowed her brow once more and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Kuroin Von Begner... I don't like his attitude. He was the first to accept becoming a Vampire, and he acts like he'd lick His Majesty's feet if he just asked him..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Those words can be construed as disloyalty towards the Emperor, Madam."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I just want to maintain peace in the Empire. His Majesty knows how I feel. Moreover, I ended up becoming a wretched Vampire too. So don't nitpick, got it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoo. As always, you're quite fussy, Madam."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"And you're always noisy and annoying."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo just watched the fussy woman and the chatty man. If he were being honest, then he felt like they were good people. But they were going to die anyway, so it didn't really matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it concerned him that they knew Arema Steelworker from a long while back. If his identity was exposed half-way through the operation, then he would have to kill these precious soldiers right then and there. If he knew this would happen then he would have absorbed Arema Steelworker directly (though he'd feel a bit sorry for Chi Paul)...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'No, there's no point in regretting it now. I can do it. I can act like him with just the info I have on hand. Only then can I call myself a true Joker.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was still in South Korea there was a voice phishing scam that worked by just knowing one's name and telephone number. It was the most simple, but also most advanced level of trickery that anticipated one's responses and behavior while leading them to give you what you wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Lee Shin Woo already knew Arema Steelworker's personality, and could perfectly replicate his appearance and voice. There was no way he couldn't do what so many other swindlers could!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the Light General</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">approached him, slapped his back, and said curtly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're just as slow as ever, Arema.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Mm.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was really difficult to measure how close they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if they were close enough that she told him to hurry up and give the order, then despite the hostility that she showed him earlier... she didn't seem to really hate Arema Steelworker. She was essentially acknowledging that he had the right to command them, including her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo snorted and said.</span></p>

I won't be defeated like you. You won't get a chance to do anything, Arema. Just think about a way to safely get into the capital."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"His Majesty told me that you knew where Seagald was. Do you have a surefire method of finding him? Or do you have an artifact that can find him?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's nothing so amazing. My subordinates scoured the underground for dozens of years, so I was able to find his bases. In exchange, I lost some of my precious subordinates, but... He shouldn't be able to hide within the capital. Especially if his goal is Jissehanu.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"As expected."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Spear General shrugged his shoulders and narrowed his eyes.
