 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Y-You're going to... give this to me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yep. Well, I'm not exactly giving it to you, but lending it to you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a level 9 artifact, so just giving it to her wouldn't have a good effect on her karma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could barely even lend it to her, as the item's level was much too high, but... by using his Dark Shadow and Wild Card skills, he was able to make up for her deficiencies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?! Mr. Shin Woo, this is the best item I've ever seen! How could you hand it out so casually?!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I pretty much have no way of using it right now, so I decided to give it to Jin Jin, who can use it effectively."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pleine, who was watching from the side, widened her eyes and tried to stop him, but Lee Shin Woo just shrugged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Lee Shin Woo was well aware of how amazing the Phoenix's Feather was... &nbsp;It didn't matter that it was more geared towards women. If he were to absorb it, he could adjust it to a form that suited him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'But that's the problem. I can't.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a little more study, his Bone Reinforcement, Rule of Bone, or Bone Armory skills may evolve to even greater heights. However, that wasn't happening anytime soon. These skills wouldn't be able to alter an artifact that the level 9 divine bird, the Garuda, dropped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Still... Do I even have the right to accept this? I-I'm scared. If something happens to me and I can't return it, then... Especially this special active skill! You can only use it once, but if I were to waste it...!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That ability's why I'm giving you this item. Think about it. The Sun God's Blessing is ultimately the Garuda's blessing. But I killed the Garuda, so will that blessing actually benefit me? I don't think so."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the truth. Though the Garuda had rotted away (literally), it was still a level 9 divine bird. Even till the bitter end, it was suspicious and wary of Lee Shin Woo, so there was a chance those feelings were stored within this artifact. It wouldn't be much of an issue with Lee Shin Woo's abilities, but it was still kind of awkward for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"The best case scenario is if nothing happens to you, but... it'd be a weight off my shoulders if you were to use this skill to survive if you find yourself in danger. So, don't feel so burdened and just wear it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, Ye Jin Jin still felt burdened from his request, even though he'd gone so far to assure her. Well, it made sense. To Lee Shin Woo, a revival ability wasn't really a big deal, but to Ye Jin Jin, it must be. The artifact's other abilities were quite considerable as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He supposed it couldn't be helped. Lee Shin Woo decided to give her some 'extra service'. He beckoned her with his finger and Ye Jin Jin came over to him, albeit confused. Then, he whispered a few words into her ear. It was super effective!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huah... I-I understand!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good girl."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after, she distanced herself from him. However, her face was flushed beet red as she quietly nodded her head. She had barely accepted the Phoenix's Feather. Her reaction caused him to smile in satisfaction, and those who had watched their interaction narrowed their eyes. Of course, he didn't let that bother him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"But there's no way that you can just wear this cheat item. It's impossible, so long as you don't possess the level 6 high rank fire element like me. I can temporarily trick the item by using my Wild Card skill, but it won't last so it won't work with me alone."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...Is that where I come in?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoh. You got so smart from just one level up, our little Zenon."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn't even called him, but Zenon came forward. Once he'd become a level 8 Shining Salamander, he retained his appearance as a fire lizard. However, his body was a lot smaller than before, as he had shed his skin. He had much smoother curves than before and gave off a sense of elegance. As he thought, the higher level the spirit, the more attractive they became.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I can control that artifact. That girl... Ye Jin Jin, right? I can help her use the artifact. Moreover, if I were to help her, Ye Jin Jin will be able to unleash even greater flames, and she won't have any problems being your representative.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"90 points. You're just a little bit off."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'll stay by her side and protect her. At the same time, I'll relay information on the surface to you. And... you're hoping that I grow with her, right?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Bingo. 100 points. You've just obtained the light element, so you need time to try out your new abilities and grow. If you stay by her side, then you can go wild without people suspecting a thing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, forming a contract with a spirit would cause the spirit to adopt some of the contractor's qualities. Zenon had said exactly what Lee Shin Woo had wanted and went inside of the Phoenix's Feather. The Phoenix's Feather, which had unrestrainedly expelled flames everywhere, calmed down and looked like a normal red dress now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He passed the dress over to Ye Jin Jin without hesitation. Ye Jin Jin accepted it with much difficulty and felt the dress over. Then, she carefully voiced her appreciation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When I look at it up close, it looks quite splendid. It might be difficult to talk to someone wearing this everyday!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Who cares? It's better for a hero to stand out anyway. You're pretty and have a nice body, so it’ll look nice on you. Don't worry."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hehehe..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He added in some compliments here and there, making her feel happy. 'If she met a silver-tongued bastard, then she'd be completely fooled by him...' he thought. But when he thought about it again, Lee Shin Woo realized he&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">was</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;that silver-tongued bastard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ye Jin Jin, Zenon, and Bisher Moon (who's still in the Empire working); you guys will be responsible for the surface. Rem will support you too. I made sure to check, but the Emperor doesn't know that I've taken control of the golem network. We should be able to acquire information regarding the movements of his forces, the 12 Generals, and his plans. Mostly everything, aside from the Emperor himself."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Understood!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I trust that you haven't changed your mind. I'll definitely make a world where all spirits can live in peace.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a trustworthy response. Although Ye Jin Jin currently needed the Phoenix's Feather and Zenon to do much of anything right now, if she were to be 'Lawrence and 'Kay's representative', then... the amount of karma and Perium she gained would skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, she'd quickly become level 7. She might even reach level 8 before the underground heroes. That’s how far his influence reached!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm. I'll lend you one more thing."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how offensively capable the Phoenix's Feather was, it was still a defensive item, so Lee Shin Woo decided to let her borrow a weapon too. It was a javelin created by transforming the level 7 Fire Dragon's Scale Greatsword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In exchange for its special options, it gained the ability to amplify the fire element when thrown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is an amazing item!? Can I really have it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah. You can have this one. If it breaks, I can fix it from afar."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had to use one of his 10 Bone Armory slots for it, both his Rule of Bone and Bone Armory skills had grown significantly; even if she were on the surface and he were underground, he could still maintain the weapon for her and even reinforce it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't much for Lee Shin Woo, but to Ye Jin Jin, it was an 'unbreakable' divine spear. And thus, he had successfully created a hero on the spot. The Emperor must be astonished right now!</span></p>

If his Bone Reinforcement advanced a little bit more, and if he studied how to interfere with bone and other matter a bit more, then he should be able to do it, but he couldn't yet.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Elder Dryad Princess knew full well that she shouldn't be stubborn. In the end, she nodded her head and said.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He ignored the other's reactions again and Lee Shin Woo ordered to go their separate ways. Ye Jin Jin nodded her head and bought medicine with all the money she'd accumulated thus far. She took all of it at once, wore the Phoenix's Feather, with Zenon inside, placed the Javelin Lee Shin Woo had created for her on her back and then left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Then, shall we get going?"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I told you. Watch and enjoy."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo winked at her and activated the Heaven Door's Key. Lee Shin Woo took out some of the accumulated bones from his inventory and used all the mana he'd saved up to create a gate... Pleine watched on vacantly, but when they took one step into the gate she said to their backs...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin tilted his head from beside Lee Shin Woo.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you don't need to avoid me out of guilt. Do you understand? I told you in advance."</span></p>
