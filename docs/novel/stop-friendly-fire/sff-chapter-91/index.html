As it possessed Sinea's magic, who had been reborn as a Dryad Princess, he thought it might become the material for an artifact, but fortunately him grabbing the branch didn't transform it into bone.</span></p>

It seemed like his silence was enough for her, as Sinea smiled softly and stepped back. She had instantly gained a commanding appearance upon absorbing the spirit stone and being reborn as a Dryad Princess.</span></p>

Of course, they weren't going above ground immediately. They were using the railway to travel to the winery and leave through that exit instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And by doing so, Lee Shin Woo wouldn't have to worry about the Dryads for some time. They had everything they would need underground already, so as long as nobody disturbed them, they should be able to stockpile energy and grow from within.</span></p>

If he was a human, he probably would've sighed refreshingly right now, but it was quite unfortunate that he couldn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"In any case, we're finished with this."</span></p>

When he thought about it, he hadn't originally set out to save the Dryads. He'd just gone to the forest using the knowledge of Vitas' troops to level up his Acid Resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even when he thought about it himself, he couldn't really give a good reason as to how the situation had become like this. He could only say that he had acted according to his instincts and this was the result that followed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"But you were able to rest a little because of the Dryads, as we've been fighting all this time. Plus, you were able to see some beautiful women too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"If this constitutes 'taking a break', then how much do we have to move around for it to be called 'hectic'? ...Besides, all those beautiful women were flirting with you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Haha."</span></p>

Moreover, they had spent almost two months training their Acid Resistance skills, so they had managed to escape the throes of death. Maybe he'd achieve the feat of being the first undead that died from overworking himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I got it.

However, as soon as Lee Shin Woo relayed his next destination to Jin through Assimilation, he soon uttered in a stiff voice.</span></p>

It was also the location where Shino Rendu had died and been reborn as an undead! It had been some time since, so he wanted to see if Metafel had left as well.</span></p>

The mysterious energy that inhabited all existence. It could possess an infinite number of properties depending on the wielder.

When they had first met, Jin had been a higher level than Lee Shin Woo, but now, there was a difference of about 500 stats between them. Still, at the very least, Jin possessed the Child of Light skill, which increased his agility stat gain by three times, so the disparity hadn't grown any larger than this.</span></p>

Jin's sprint related skills, his body designed for running, and above all, the imbalance of his high agility stat with his other stats that resulted in his speed, would certainly increase Lee Shin Woo's strength.</span></p>
