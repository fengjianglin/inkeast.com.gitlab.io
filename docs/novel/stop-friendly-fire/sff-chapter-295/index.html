 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo created a hand mirror using the Metal Element and checked his appearance. It was perfect. He looked exactly like the Archmage, Feotane Von Seldin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[But will it really be alright, Father? If the Emperor is aware of the Archmage's death, then...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Paul asked worryingly. By reaching level 8, Chi Paul had not only grown substantially in terms of power but had also gained Disguise abilities second only to Lee Shin Woo himself. Thus, he was the best choice to accompany him to the capital. Ironically, Chi Paul was currently disguised as a normal undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he wasn't any normal undead. It was more precise to call him an undead hero. Lee Shin Woo knew, from the Archmage's memories, that the Archmage enjoyed using the undead heroes as guards. Thus, Chi Paul was disguised as an undead hero.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the other 12 Generals were dead and the Emperor likely knew this as well, so even if he wanted to impersonate one of the others, he couldn't.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Although the Archmage pledged his loyalty to the Emperor, he doesn't trust him. The Emperor knew this and respected him anyway. Because of this, their relationship was able to last.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You're saying that...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The Emperor doesn't know about the Lich's death. He has no way of knowing. Of course, he'd be suspicious of the Archmage's absence, but how long has it been since I killed the Lich? It's only been four hours. Moreover, before then, the Lich left, stating he'd take care of the heroes. He wouldn't suspect anything in that short period of time.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Lee Shin Woo, who had got going right away, had killed the Lich and had brought the majority of the undead heroes to his side... However, if he were to go to the capital right now it would be him 'returning' to the capital, not infiltrating it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Ugh, I can finally act like a human, yet I have to take this form.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'll turn you into a perfect human someday, so just wait a little longer.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the Archmage didn't ride a horse, Jin was currently disguised as an undead hero as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked very much like her human form, but because she was 'undeadified', she didn't seem to like it very much. Only a very, very small portion of her body had bone or muscle exposed, yet she hated it anyway. Whether it be one cheek or one shoulder exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, he had left her legs intact so that she could move properly. Moreover, she had covered her body from head-to-toe with silver steel, so she didn't look like an undead at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm not pretty.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's fine. You're plenty pretty to me. I'm not kidding. You really are.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Then can we kiss?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Nope, no thanks.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You want to die?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin gritted her teeth at Lee Shin Woo's firm refusal and practiced walking. She'd been a horse for so long that when she took on her current form, she began placing her hands on the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was quickly able to adapt, perhaps due to her authority, and was soon able to move quickly on her two feet as well. Lee Shin Woo confirmed that she was able to move on her own, nodded his head, and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You guys just need to stand a short distance behind me. You don't need to say anything. Since we're now entering the heart of enemy territory...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hoo... Lee Shin Woo exhaled (even though nothing came out), and relaxed himself. Of course, he was no longer afraid of the Emperor. This was nothing more than the nervousness of an actor before he got on the big stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was at it, he might as well do it perfectly. There were so many unknowns on this stage, so if he were unable to do his job properly, then it would be a pain in the ass later. If he died, he would revive due to Invisible Heart, but he couldn't revive others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew he would revive if he died, but he'd rather live than die. He obviously had so many ways he could survive. If he didn't want to live, then he could always die later. But he couldn't do that right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...Alright, let's trick them to the very end and come out alive.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Pfft, that's so like you. Sounds good.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You sure have weird taste.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[T-Then... Father, excuse me.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin grinned and came closer to Lee Shin Woo. Chi Paul, looking apologetic, came closer to him as well. Lee Shin Woo nodded his head and softly swung his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, just like with the Archmage, the flow of mana connecting the two spaces formed and sucked them in. They were immediately transported to the capital, inside the palace (the most dangerous area within the capital) at that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they were transported, time began to flow once more. This was proof that Lee Shin Woo both understood and could use the time element better than the Archmage. Hurray for Bone Reinforcement and innate elements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...Archmage?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they arrived, they faced their very first obstacle. It was the last of the underground's Four Heavenly Commanders, the general who'd killed the Sun Spear General (who had been one of the surface's Heavenly Commanders), the Heaven Sundering General, Leofield Von Tariman!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By absorbing the Sun Spear General's bone, Lee Shin Woo had already seen Leofield's spearmanship, as well as his other skills. But it was different seeing him in person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Isn't it obvious, Duke Tariman? Everything you say reeks of sweat.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge undead came over, and although Lee Shin Woo was nervous from his appearance (a Death Knight), he replied exactly as the Archmage's memories indicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was huge; now it made sense that people wondered whether he inherited a Giant's blood or not. His body was covered in muscles, and these muscles, despite him becoming undead, pulsed and wriggled with cold blood and magic, as well as the air element. The pressure he emitted was so great that it felt like it could stab him to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He's on the same level as Seagald? No way! Though Seagald's swordsmanship may surpass Leofield's, if he compared the degree of perfection of their bodies, as well as their training, then Leofield was superior! He could completely understand why all the spearman he'd come across had yelled Leofield's name!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Hmm, did your job go well...? Huh?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'd appreciate it if you stopped looking at me like that. Are your ears starting to fail now too?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Archmage and the Heaven Sundering General, as two of the Four Heavenly Commanders that pledged their allegiance to the Emperor, respected each other, they possessed a slightly troublesome relationship where that respect wouldn't show outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they had reached the pinnacle of their respective arts (magic vs. martial arts), they were prideful in their arts and frequently clashed with each other. However... the Heaven Sundering General's reaction was a bit strange, considering how he was following the Archmage's memories to the letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Are you really... the Archmage? Hmm, something's strange.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What's strange is your brain, Duke Tariman. It was always strange; has it finally completely rotted away?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[No, I'm not the one who's strange. The smell... The smell is strange. Hmm... strange. It's strange.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo shuddered. Once his Acting skill had passed the level 20 mark, no one had ever seen through his Acting or Disguise skills. However, the rumored musclehead was suspicious of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the hell happened? No, he had no time to be thinking! If Leofield was suspicious of him, then he'd bring it up to the Emperor as well. He had to stop him!</span></p>

Tell me, what's so strange? The actions of the heroes? The Anti-Skull led by the damn Seagald? If not, then the Heavenly Commanders that came from the surface?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm talking about you, Archmage. You're strange. My intuition... is telling me that.]</span></p>

The Heaven Sundering General took out his spear and gripped it. And once he gripped his long, gray spear, the atmosphere inside changed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one reaches level 8, they gain an authority: the ability to treat the ambient mana as their own and absorb it. However, the way they go about doing so differed depending on the individual. The Heaven Sundering General seemed to be able to absorb the surrounding mana with his spirit alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If I'm wrong, I'm truly sorry.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Flash. It was sometimes used to describe lightning cascading through the air. If so, then why was it used as the name for Leofield's attack when he used the air element? The answer was exceedingly simple.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shock was akin to getting struck by a lightning bolt. The Heaven Flash would kill anyone equally. And that's where his title of Heaven Sundering had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Critical Hit!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Archmage couldn't dodge this. It was impossible for Lee Shin Woo too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he tried to teleport away the moment Leofield went to grip his spear, preemptively attacked him, used the Annihilation Flame to erase his presence and confuse Leofield, or used all of his innate elements combined, the best he could do was turn the spear's trajectory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn't 100% confident that he could dodge Leofield's strike even with all that.

Leofield's strike had pierced through his armor and bone. Even Lee Shin Woo found it a bit laughable that there was a spear dangling in his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm really sorry. This is the first time my intuition's been wrong.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heaven Sundering General calmly removed the spear and apologized. To be honest, Leofield hadn't attacked with the intention to kill. He had just wanted to see if the Archmage was the real deal or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why? Because the Archmage didn't need to dodge his attack, as his soul was stored someplace else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, it would take a considerable amount of time and mana to restore his (the Lich's) body, so Leofield had held back so that he didn't destroy the Lich's entire body. This was only possible because he was the Heaven Sundering General.</span></p>
