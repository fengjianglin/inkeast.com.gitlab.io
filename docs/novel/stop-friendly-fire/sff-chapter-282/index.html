 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo tested out the Fire Shadow Element several times and felt as though this element suited him more than Seagald.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fire Shadow would connect him to his subordinates, strengthen them, and protect them... This ability, which would buff his contractees, was similar to the Lightning Bind Element, but also completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...It feels a bit unpleasant. It feels like you're right beside me at all times."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I'm testing out the ability, so bear with it."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is strange. It's a buff? It feels like some unknown power is strengthening my every move."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My fire-using subordinates will likely experience the most extreme change."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Magic Emperor's Lightning Bind specialized in controlling his subordinate's power, Fire Shadow was the opposite; it used the user's power to strengthen their subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning Bind forcefully took control of one's body at long-range, whereas Fire Shadow allowed the user to transport to their subordinate's side. They were both opposite extremes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...The reason Seagald's soldiers were forced to immolate themselves to summon him was all due to his inexperience with it. Seagald's skill in the light element had far outstripped his skill in the darkness element, thus disallowing him from using the Fire Shadow Element properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...This is fun. Plus, it's really useful. It was definitely something I needed.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo hadn't been able to strengthen his subordinates with the darkness element, so he was overjoyed that he'd gotten an innate element with the ability to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fire Shadow would likely strengthen his darkness as well. To be more specific, he felt as though he would find new possibilities. Like with the overlapping ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Oh, this works?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo found that he could 'only' transfer the effects of his skills or elements. With this, Lee Shin Woo could have some fun. But because Jin and Seira resented him for this, he soon stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you do it again, I'll get mad for real. I'll cry for you. Do you understand what this means?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Do you have any idea how much strategic value lays in this ability..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Stop. Use it when you need that 'strategic value'."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yes, ma'am. I'm so sorry."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he'd gotten familiar with the Fire Shadow Element and raised it to Beginner Lv8, Lee Shin Woo lifted the next item. It was none other than the level 9 bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it just him, or was there light coming from the bone? He soon realized that it wasn't him seeing things. This bone, which had undergone a deep fusion with the artificial sun, was already part artifact. He took a deep breath and tightly gripped the bone. Then, he activated Bone Reinforcement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Absorbing the Lv9 Light Tinged Annihilation Flame Sword God's Frontal Bone through Bone Reinforcement. Strength and Agility have increased by 200, Health by 100, and Magic by 300. The High Rank Light and Fire Elements have become Lv10 and have been maxed out. Magic has increased by 480.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo somewhat knew what to expect, as he'd absorbed the level 9 Garuda's bone before. Yet, he was absolutely gobsmacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn't just the effect of Seagald's bone; the abilities from the bone fused together with his own, causing him to reach a new level. He had maxed the Light and Fire Elements in one go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'...It's hot! Shit, it's really hot!'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd been looking forward to this, but the aftereffects of mastering two elements simultaneously were huge. It felt as though the bright light and the hot flames were erupting from his cells and exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he'd mastered the Darkness Element, all he needed to do was feel and think about the darkness element, but this was different. The various elements asserted their existence within him and went wild. Lee Shin Woo's mind was in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, he had a close association with both the Fire and Light Elements. A flame-wielding swordsman appearing within the Retadane family, which had inherited the Light Element for generations, was no coincidence. Lee Shin Woo studied these two elements in-depth and then closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[High Rank Fire Resistance has become Lv10 and has been maxed out. Magic has increased by 50.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, his Fire Resistance had been maxed out as well. The element had been maxed out, so it was only natural that the resistance would follow suit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the unpleasantness, which was akin to wearing clothes that didn't fit, disappeared; he felt great, as though he'd just dipped into a warm hot spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Yeah, I shouldn't overthink it. I shouldn't separate myself from the two elements. Just like how I can become darkness and the other way around, I can become fire and light as well.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he'd mastered the Darkness Element, Lee Shin Woo had transformed his entire body into darkness; like that time, he transformed his body into fire and light, filling the entire area with the two elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he became one with the darkness, he had collected it at a single point. But it was different with the fire and light elements; he switched between expanding and contracting them, as well as heating them and cooling them. Surprisingly, his Manatization skill, which had leveled up not too long ago, had leveled up once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The Manatization skill has become Lv7, and Health and Magic have increased by 20.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have reached the peak of light and darkness. You have satisfied the conditions required to fuse the two elements together. You have acquired the title, 'Chaos Spawn'. All stats have increased by 30. The power of all your elements increases by 10%.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Hoo."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimately, the light and fire completely disappeared and nothing remained. Then, Lee Shin Woo appeared from within the void and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Element is strengthened when the Light Element is maxed out. It was a natural phenomenon. Contrary to others, who geared more to one side or the other, Lee Shin Woo had chosen the right path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Have you become a god?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You'd become like this too if you max an element."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Isn't that what a god is?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"At first, that's what I thought too, but I found that gods aren't pushovers. I have no idea how they all become gods so easily."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seira asked and Lee Shin Woo teasingly replied. Then, he caught his breath. He knew that it wasn't over yet. He'd won big, of course, but he had yet to receive Seagald's greatest ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You have acquired the fusion element, Intermediate Annihilation Flame Lv1. Magic has increased by 100.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Annihilation Flame, which was both a fusion and innate element, and was created by combining the essence of both the Fire and Light Elements. Because he had mastered both the Light and Fire Elements, the Annihilation Flame started off at the intermediate level, despite it being Seagald's innate element! Though there was still the matter of it being capped at intermediate level 10!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'They're fundamentally similar, but it's also completely different from Shining Flame.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shining Flame was used to vaporize anything and everything. On the other hand, the Annihilation Flame was collected inside one's body and burned one's self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that didn't mean that it would vaporize the user. The burnt body and soul wouldn't be destroyed, and something else would be substituted in their place. And thus, the user would appear in a completely different state, unbeknownst to their opponent. That's why he felt as though Seagald's Annihilation Flame was greater than the Garuda's Shining Flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'And that's why I had such a hard time dealing with him, but... It ultimately became my power.'</span></p>

When he fought against Seagald, he'd gotten a good grasp on how the Annihilation Flame worked, so if he just practiced it a little bit more, then he could truly make it his own.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo felt relieved, as he thought his body was finished with all the changes. However, another unexpected happened.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo really had no way of knowing that this existed beforehand.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly... He was really lucky. His priority was the Manatization skill, yet by passing the 10,000 Magic mark, his body had been transformed to be more suitable for the skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His stats, which had originally been balanced, were completely all over the place, but it didn't really matter.

If God loves you, she turns you into a skeleton?' is what she wanted to say, but Jin remembered everything Lee Shin Woo had done thus far and just kept her mouth shut. It really did feel like Lee Shin Woo was loved by God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whereas, Lee Shin Woo had no idea what they were talking about and was drawing out the remaining essence from Seagald's bone. It consisted of memories of Seagald and the Archmage creating the artificial sun together, and even then, Seagald was already level 8.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...How ironic. Before he'd died, Seagald had said that 'if he died, then the sun will never shine upon the Empire ever again'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seagald had stated that he'd collect the sun once they return to the surface... Did he keep his promise, since he assimilated with the sun, or should he say that he was indeed an undead, as he had forgotten his promise?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'Well... Anyway, it'll turn out exactly as you said, Seagald.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no longer a need for the sun underground, as there would soon be a victor. By retrieving his light, Lee Shin Woo felt the Empire fill with darkness and took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this, the Empire's darkness would become even stronger, and anyone who had relied on the artificial sun would lose their way. The end was near. Neither side would back off now. The unavoidable final battle was approaching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Shall we make a break for it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo checked his Mana Radar and confirmed that the Sun Spear General, who stayed back to stop Leofield Von Tariman, was dead. He then checked that the remaining golems had accomplished their mission (of collecting the bone he left behind), nodded his head, and opened a gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His party soon disappeared from the capital.
