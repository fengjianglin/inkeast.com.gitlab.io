 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He'd acquired an army of 10,000 spirits in an unexpected place! Moreover, he'd also obtained a crucial springboard to conquering the surface. Funnily enough, none of this had come about due to his extensive planning, but due to him bringing Sinea with him without really thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You really don't know what'll happen in life."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's really moving hearing that from you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin replied teasingly. So many good things had happened, yet Jin didn't seem very happy. The reason was quite simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sinea had approached Lee Shin Woo quite aggressively, but once he'd formed an official contract with her, she was so happy that she clung onto him like a girl who'd been in a relationship for 2 weeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Hoo. Hoo. Paul Zero.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"We've already formed a contract; do you not need to use my real name?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[An exchange of one's real name is like a wedding ring, so it's fine.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I-Is it..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo finally understood how she felt about him. Apparently, a formal contract with a spirit is like a wedding ceremony. Even more so when the spirits' gender is clearly distinguished like the Dryads (the Dryads are all female)!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been waiting for the time to form an official contract with him, yet Lee Shin Woo had the gall to form a contract with 10,000 other spirits first. So he could understand her pent-up frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hoo..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You can stare at me all you want, I'm not going to give Paul Zero to you!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"..."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Jin actually appreciated that she recognized him as a rival, which was all the more pitiful. That unspeakable misery made Jin think, 'can I score a point now?', but then, their last remaining party member said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Will this really be ok?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit shaped like a flaming lizard was, of course, the level 7 Elder Salamander Prince Zenon. Lee Shin Woo had ordered the other spirits to form teams and find the newly born spirits on the surface, but he had asked Zenon to follow him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry. Even the 12 generals wouldn't be able to recognize you when you're hidden within the flames I've created."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[No, I'm ok. I'm right beside you, so I won't be in danger. I'm worried about the other spirits.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was thankful for the overestimation, but Lee Shin Woo was still level 7. Of course, if he told Zenon that he was level 7, he wouldn't believe him. Lee Shin Woo's stats were on the cusp of level 8, he possessed a variety of high rank skills, and his level 11 Rule of Bone skill increased his stats equivalent to a level 8.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'I'm this strong at level 7, so what'll happen when I reach level 8...'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was confident that he could take on the level 8 12 generals head-on when he hit level 8. Even if he encountered that Lich again! Lee Shin Woo could manage against the Lich due to the buffs from his Rebellion skill if they were to fight right now. Even from his own point of view, he felt like he didn't have any weak spots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Do you have a plan?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"A plan? Ah, you mean for the spirits that can go to the surface now. Nope."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Keut.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo replied irresponsibly and Zenon looked like he was at his wit's end. When they had formed a contract, Zenon had seemed so confident, but now that the excitement had worn off he seemed fearful again. Lee Shin Woo sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Like I said, I've taken control of the Emperor's golem network that orders the golems to search for and kill any spirits they find. For now, no one will find out about the spirits. Of course, there's no helping the ones who are unluckily found."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Then that means they're in danger...!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"So you wanted revenge when you're not willing to risk anything to get it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Keuk...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zenon's weak response caused Lee Shin Woo to sigh once again. How was he such a coward? His attitude didn't fit his appearance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he'd expected this from the very beginning. If coaxing them to fight had been easy, and they had sufficient courage while being willing to charge into danger without hesitation, then they wouldn't have hidden within the Spirits' Spring in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's what war is like. Each person risks their life. Moreover, the task I've assigned to the spirits is their most important one; it's for the spirits' 'future' and what they'll do after the battle is over. If they can't do that, then give up on your revenge."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...I can't give up. We all agree on this.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Good. Don't forget that feeling."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Lee Shin Woo wasn't planning on leaving the spirits to die. The golem network would help, but he also left some spirits on standby within the Spirits' Spring; these spirits would act as a 'rescue unit' and were ready to be deployed whenever necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were to die, even though he went through all this effort, then there was really no helping it. They were executing their plan in a much safer environment than the Paul Zero Corps, which was going around the Underground Empire and hunting the undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I'm willing to die for you, Paul Zero. But before then, I'd like to leave behind a child.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't worry, you're not going to die."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Paul Zero...]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weren't Dryads birthed from trees? So if they had another way of leaving behind children, then what was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to ask, but at the same time, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of anxiety, so he kept it to himself. Following his official contract with her, Sinea began to look at him more sensuously than before. Perhaps... No, he'd figure that out when they were alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It's good to be loved by a spirit. You even got the Spirits' Spring to respond to you; you truly are an impressive Elementalist.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm, you'll see that later."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zenon seemed truly awestruck by Lee Shin Woo. On the other hand, Lee Shin Woo just felt bitter, replied, and hurried on his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would soon reach the end of the Spirits' Road. Lee Shin Woo had set it up so that they would arrive outside of the thicket near Kuroa's Glory. At first, it had taken several hours to get to the Spirits' Spring, but it only took a few minutes on the way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If I can control the exit, then I can go wherever I wish on the surface without the Heaven Door's Key."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're too greedy."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Greedy? You'd be surprised how much I'm holding back right now. If you knew, you'd be shocked."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Y-Yeah...?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin tilted his head at Lee Shin Woo's unbelievable response. However, Lee Shin Woo was telling the truth. Although he'd become able to transform into a spirit, and had leveled up his Disguise skill, enabling him to transform into a human, he desperately held back his desires with the thought 'not while Jin's here'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, he'd even formed a contract with 10,000 spirits and the Spirits' Spring itself, so a compliment wouldn't even be enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It's already night. Rest up for now, Jin. Starting tomorrow, you probably won't have anything to do for two days."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ok. Then call me when you're free. Let's play some board games."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard the word 'board games', Lee Shin Woo inwardly smiled bitterly. Board games. As Jin couldn't sleep or eat, Lee Shin Woo had thought of board games as a way to pass the time. Since he wanted to prove that humans had other methods of relieving stress other than eating or sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there was no way that this world had any proper board games. He referenced some of the board games he'd played on Earth and created them in his spare time, but Jin had reacted a lot better to them than he'd expected. Jin pointed out that his world had board games like this too, but Lee Shin Woo just used the excuse of parallel worlds. It was his 'absolute defense' skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sure, I can always spare some time for some board games."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ok. Then, see you tomorrow."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tied Jin to his normal spot. Jin could clearly see him if he looked through the 1st floor window, but from the 2nd floor, Lee Shin Woo was free from his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo discreetly checked his inventory and inwardly clenched his fist. Ultimately, he triumphantly passed the living room and when he was about to go up to the 2nd floor, someone stopped him. Ye Jin Jin was quietly doing paperwork in the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ah, Mr. Shin Woo! Welcome back."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You weren't asleep? You'll be busy tomorrow too."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Well, I thought if I finished my work a little quicker, then I would be able to go on a date with you before you go to the capital... Ah, that's only if you accept, Mr. Shin Woo!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[...Seems like you're not only loved by spirits.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Jin Jin replied and her cheeks became flushed. Seeing that, Zenon (he was hiding his existence, so Ye Jin Jin couldn't hear him) quietly muttered. Lee Shin Woo ignored him and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Don't sleep too late."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ok! I'll read just a little bit more and then I'll go to sleep."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo was actually quite surprised by her growth. After their first meeting Ye Jin Jin began to grow rapidly, and when she came to the surface she quickly picked up the shop business. She had so much latent potential that he couldn't help but say 'as expected of a hero'.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew what the driving force behind her actions was, so he was a bit concerned, but... He should be able to solve that problem. Why? Because he could turn into a human now! If she's seeking his affection, then he could give it to her bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This is nothing compared to my days of entertaining clients as an employee.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn't even count how many times he'd eaten together with a girl or attended a party in order to close a deal. That wasn't all. He'd been asked for more more than twice before. When he really hated it, he did anything he could to get out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that was what work life was. You use everything you could get your hands on to succeed, or you keep your pride and chastity... Whichever you choose, you would have to make a choice you didn't like again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'How does it compare to back then? She's a cute girl that'll do anything I ask of her. This is actually a win-win... It doesn't even compare to South Korea.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they knew about the environment he was in, all salarymen would clamor at him to change places with them. He had no plans of switching with them, Lee Shin Woo thought, and raised his head. Lee Shin Woo had already reached his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh? What about Zenon?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I told him go away and go to sleep. I don't have the time to deal with him when you're by my side, Paul Zero.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sinea said coldly, but soon her expression changed. She approached Lee Shin Woo's side and he realized that she'd found out about his Disguise skill’s upgrade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"When did you find out?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Paul Zero, you can transform into a spirit too.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...I see."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did he not notice? Lee Shin Woo felt like he was an idiot. If spirits could eat and sleep, then they had reproductive abilities as well. And since Lee Shin Woo had succeeded in transforming into a spirit...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that when you decided you had to form a contract with me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I decided to form a contract with you before then, but it's true that the situation was good.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Is that so... Wait a sec. There was something I wanted to do when I turned back into a human."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo stopped Sinea, who looked at him like a predator would its prey, and took out a bottle of wine from his inventory. It was the Kerr Century Elemental 451.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Oh my. This is the wine we made together. It really fits.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That wasn't my intention, but... You want a drink too?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yeah.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lee Shin Woo brought the wine glass to his lips and felt something. When was the last time he'd drunk wine? It's definitely been more than a year. Moreover, he'd spent such dark days in the Underground Empire, so it felt like it'd been even longer since his last sip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"...Aah."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he could accept it if this was the result of all that hard work. Since good wine was created by proper maturation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It really is delicious.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yeah. ...It's so delicious I feel like I'll cry."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could smell the aroma of the wine with his disguised nose, and the wine travelled down his disguised tongue and passed through his disguised throat. It was then heated up by his disguised stomach. This feeling, which he'd regained, felt like ecstasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Hoo.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Sinea smiled mysteriously and got even closer. It seemed like she wasn't willing to wait any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, he wanted to enjoy the wine a bit longer, but it couldn't be helped. He shrugged his shoulders and accepted her. The Dryads' refreshing and sweet aroma invaded his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">'This is also business. ...A win-win, huh. How nice.'</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days later, Lee Shin Woo had completely finished his work as Lawrence and he and his party went on a short trip to the capital.</span></p>
