  <br>
  <p>*puchi*</p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A trail of fresh blood splattered all over Jarken’s face as he savagely ripped out the windpipe of an enemy beast.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Uleron, cover the left flank! One of the griffins has managed to penetrate our defensive line there!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The dark panther roared at the nearby towering golden gorilla who was currently engaged in combat with two enemy beasts.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Hearing Jarken’s commanding voice, Uleron swiftly grabbed the two beasts by their necks and smashed their heads together into a mush of flesh. Nodding his head at the panther, the massive gorilla pounded his fists against his chest as he let out a fearsome cry.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The body of the golden gorilla started to rapidly expand until he reached a height of twelve feet. Furthermore, two ivory tusks slowly emerged from his bottom jaw. Bending his thick knees slightly, Uleron used his powerful legs to jump up high into the sky and towards the crumbling line of defense at the west part of the battlefield. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“How long are you going to sneak around?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken coldly stated to his right once Uleron had left.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Haha, so you did discover me. Although I do not wish to fight this war, I must heed the orders of my king. Prepare yourself, panther.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Orpen softly responded, as his figure gradually became visible. He had been using a secret cultivation technique to alter the light waves around him, but it still failed to escape Jarken’s sharp senses. With a mellow, white glow emanating from his body, Orpen spread out his wings and instantly charged towards the dark panther.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“A cultivator of the light element? Looks like we were fated to clash from the very beginning.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken chuckled, as he released his own essence, and clouds of dark smoke began to revolve around him. In the next second, the dark panther nimbly rushed towards the griffin while his emerald eyes flashed with an ominous glint.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken let his pent-up bloodlust out into the open, inciting an abrupt shiver of horror from the surrounding enemies.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>This kind of bloodlust only followed those who continuously bathed themselves in the blood of countless massacres.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“What in the heavens is this…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>One of the late arriving Nobles muttered in shock upon seeing the scene below.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It should have only been a few minutes since the war had started, and yet the ground was already stained with dark crimson blood.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Weir’s forces were clearly being overwhelmed by the greater number of troops that Xardoth had brought. If it were not for the Nobles fighting at the front line, then the city would have already fallen within the first few seconds.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Regardless of how powerful the Nobles were, they were gradually starting to take injuries while they kept slaughtering the common beasts from the enemy’s camp. It seemed like even the mighty Nobles would eventually get exhausted under the constant consumption of their essence.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Meanwhile, Weir and Xardoth remained hovering in the air as their eyes locked onto each other. Theirs was a battle that could only be seen by them.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>In a different and ethereal realm, a ghost-like draconic figure was mercilessly slamming its body against a grey smoky barrier. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Inside the soul cocoon was Xardoth, as he adamantly braced himself and endured the dragon’s onslaught.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Give up, Xardoth, you cannot win against me.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Weir mentally spoke to the enraged Griffin King.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>This was a world where only the minds of the Saint stage experts could travel and any damage sustained in this plane would have a much severe effect in the real physical world.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Don’t feed me your lies, Weir, where is my son!?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth bellowed with fury, staring right into Weir’s eyes through the soul barrier. Droplets of sweat rolled down from his forehead while his body slightly trembled under the force of the silver dragon’s barrage of attacks.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Heavens have mercy! Have you gone mad? I told you already that I do not have your son, in fact, I did not even know you had a son until you came roaring into my city asking me to hand him over! I will stop attacking if you promise to calm down and think straight.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Weir suddenly stopped midway in the midst of his next attack and solemnly stated to the unreasonable griffin.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I know he is here! This was the last place that he came to, and if not you, who else could take him away? Don’t tell me that you are so pathetic as to not even know what goes on inside your own city?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth goaded the dragon, as he instantly withdrew the soul barrier and sent a surging wave of soul energy towards Weir.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“If you are not willing to listen to reason, then do not blame me for what happens next.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Weir spoke in an icy tone, livid at the inability of the griffin to think rationally.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Haha, before you make any threats, shouldn’t you look more closely at what is happening on the battlefield?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth laughed with madness, taunting Weir even more.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A trace of dread creeping into his heart, Weir momentarily turned his attention back into the real world.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Oh no…LARIS!!!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………….</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Delicious. I never knew griffins tasted this good.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken sinisterly whispered, his tongue flicking at the specks of blood splattered across the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“You bastard! What kind of a beast are you?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Orpen murderously rasped, as streams of blood unceasingly flowed out from his injured chest.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>After the first initial clash, Orpen knew that something was not right with his opponent. Although both of them were at the first rank of the Saint stage, Jarken had instantly overwhelmed him and swiftly bit out a chunk of his flesh.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>This level of savagery and brutality was not something that Orpen had expected, and he was afraid that his initial error might now lead him to his death.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“You are still talking? I thought the poison would have numbed your muscles by now.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken darkly stated, as his body quickly darted behind Orpen and grabbed the wounded griffin by his neck.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Poison? When did inject me with poison!? No… he never injected me with poison… he is the poison himself!</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Orpen’s thoughts helplessly raced, when the sudden realisation hit him that he was going to die.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Gazing into those stone-cold glowing emerald eyes, he finally knew why this panther had so easily defeated him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It was because he possessed a special bloodline!</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“My king, I am sorry that I have failed you.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Orpen breathed out the words just before a steely jaw locked onto his throat and crushed his windpipe.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Yet another beast dies today under my jaw…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken morosely whispered while glancing up at the passing clouds.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The sky was so peaceful and blue, but the earth below it was tainted by the blood of their beast kind. A sorrowful expression flickered across the panther’s face, a stark contrast to his previous behaviour with the griffin.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“It’s the way the world runs, Jarken. There is nothing that we can do to change that fate, and only hope that we survive to see the next day.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Laris softly consoled her friend, as she treaded towards the griffin’s corpse. From her bloodied armor, it appeared as if Laris had already killed a few enemy beasts on her way here.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Fate, huh? Something which I have been running away from since the beginning of my life.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The panther said in a mysterious voice.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“WATCH OUT!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Laris abruptly shouted, sensing multitudes of projectiles heading their way.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Dammit, when did they surround us!?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Jarken roared, seeing a group of griffins closing down on them as they launched a series of essence imbued spears at him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rage and fury was etched all over the griffins’ faces when they saw their captain lying dead on the ground.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Around twelve spears were headed towards Jarken, and it was clear that he would not make it out unscathed. The griffins wanted revenge for their fallen captain, and their main target was the dark panther.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Hang on, Jarken!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Laris yelled, summoning an aqua shield over the panther’s body and reinforcing it with another shield of ice.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Only a second remained until the spears were about to hit.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, in that brief span of a second, an armored griffin suddenly flashed right behind Laris and pierced his sword straight through her back and out of her stomach.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Argh!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Laris spat out a globule of blood, as she looked down at the rapidly spreading crimson colour across her stomach and the tip of the blade sticking out.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With her arms lifelessly falling to her sides, Laris slowly toppled onto the ground with the sword still pierced into her stomach.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>……………….</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Soon, a giant golden bird flew over the battlefield with a rider on top of it. His silky white fur fluttering in the wind, Rebran scanned the area for his father.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I see him! Over there, Calron!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The young lion abruptly shouted when he noticed two figures hovering in the air in the middle of the battlefield. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>One of them was his father.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“FATHER!!!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran’s juvenile voice resounded throughout the city’s outskirts.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>None of the beasts fighting below on either sides paid any heed to his shout and the war continued to take more lives.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, the Griffin King sharply turned his head towards that voice. How could he not recognise his own son’s voice?</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Ran…”</span></p>

 <p><span style>Weir’s forces were clearly being overwhelmed by the greater number of troops that Xardoth had brought. If it were not for the Nobles fighting at the front line, then the city would have already fallen within the first few seconds.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Regardless of how powerful the Nobles were, they were gradually starting to take injuries while they kept slaughtering the common beasts from the enemy’s camp. It seemed like even the mighty Nobles would eventually get exhausted under the constant consumption of their essence.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Weir and Xardoth remained hovering in the air as their eyes locked onto each other. Theirs was a battle that could only be seen by them.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>In a different and ethereal realm, a ghost-like draconic figure was mercilessly slamming its body against a grey smoky barrier. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Inside the soul cocoon was Xardoth, as he adamantly braced himself and endured the dragon’s onslaught.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Give up, Xardoth, you cannot win against me.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Weir mentally spoke to the enraged Griffin King.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>This was a world where only the minds of the Saint stage experts could travel and any damage sustained in this plane would have a much severe effect in the real physical world.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Don’t feed me your lies, Weir, where is my son!?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Xardoth bellowed with fury, staring right into Weir’s eyes through the soul barrier. Droplets of sweat rolled down from his forehead while his body slightly trembled under the force of the silver dragon’s barrage of attacks.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Heavens have mercy! Have you gone mad? I told you already that I do not have your son, in fact, I did not even know you had a son until you came roaring into my city asking me to hand him over! I will stop attacking if you promise to calm down and think straight.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Weir suddenly stopped midway in the midst of his next attack and solemnly stated to the unreasonable griffin.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I know he is here! This was the last place that he came to, and if not you, who else could take him away? Don’t tell me that you are so pathetic as to not even know what goes on inside your own city?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Xardoth goaded the dragon, as he instantly withdrew the soul barrier and sent a surging wave of soul energy towards Weir.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“If you are not willing to listen to reason, then do not blame me for what happens next.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Weir spoke in an icy tone, livid at the inability of the griffin to think rationally.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Haha, before you make any threats, shouldn’t you look more closely at what is happening on the battlefield?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Xardoth laughed with madness, taunting Weir even more.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>A trace of dread creeping into his heart, Weir momentarily turned his attention back into the real world.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Oh no…LARIS!!!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>…………………….</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Delicious. I never knew griffins tasted this good.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Jarken sinisterly whispered, his tongue flicking at the specks of blood splattered across the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“You bastard! What kind of a beast are you?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Orpen murderously rasped, as streams of blood unceasingly flowed out from his injured chest.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>After the first initial clash, Orpen knew that something was not right with his opponent. Although both of them were at the first rank of the Saint stage, Jarken had instantly overwhelmed him and swiftly bit out a chunk of his flesh.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>This level of savagery and brutality was not something that Orpen had expected, and he was afraid that his initial error might now lead him to his death.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“You are still talking? I thought the poison would have numbed your muscles by now.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Jarken darkly stated, as his body quickly darted behind Orpen and grabbed the wounded griffin by his neck.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><i><span style>Poison? When did inject me with poison!? No… he never injected me with poison… he is the poison himself!</span></i></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Orpen’s thoughts helplessly raced, when the sudden realisation hit him that he was going to die.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Gazing into those stone-cold glowing emerald eyes, he finally knew why this panther had so easily defeated him.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>It was because he possessed a special bloodline!</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“My king, I am sorry that I have failed you.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Orpen breathed out the words just before a steely jaw locked onto his throat and crushed his windpipe.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Yet another beast dies today under my jaw…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Jarken morosely whispered while glancing up at the passing clouds.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The sky was so peaceful and blue, but the earth below it was tainted by the blood of their beast kind. A sorrowful expression flickered across the panther’s face, a stark contrast to his previous behaviour with the griffin.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“It’s the way the world runs, Jarken. There is nothing that we can do to change that fate, and only hope that we survive to see the next day.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Laris softly consoled her friend, as she treaded towards the griffin’s corpse. From her bloodied armor, it appeared as if Laris had already killed a few enemy beasts on her way here.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Fate, huh? Something which I have been running away from since the beginning of my life.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The panther said in a mysterious voice.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“WATCH OUT!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Laris abruptly shouted, sensing multitudes of projectiles heading their way.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Dammit, when did they surround us!?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Jarken roared, seeing a group of griffins closing down on them as they launched a series of essence imbued spears at him.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rage and fury was etched all over the griffins’ faces when they saw their captain lying dead on the ground.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Around twelve spears were headed towards Jarken, and it was clear that he would not make it out unscathed. The griffins wanted revenge for their fallen captain, and their main target was the dark panther.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Hang on, Jarken!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Laris yelled, summoning an aqua shield over the panther’s body and reinforcing it with another shield of ice.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Only a second remained until the spears were about to hit.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>However, in that brief span of a second, an armored griffin suddenly flashed right behind Laris and pierced his sword straight through her back and out of her stomach.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Argh!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Laris spat out a globule of blood, as she looked down at the rapidly spreading crimson colour across her stomach and the tip of the blade sticking out.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>With her arms lifelessly falling to her sides, Laris slowly toppled onto the ground with the sword still pierced into her stomach.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>……………….</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Soon, a giant golden bird flew over the battlefield with a rider on top of it. His silky white fur fluttering in the wind, Rebran scanned the area for his father.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I see him! Over there, Calron!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The young lion abruptly shouted when he noticed two figures hovering in the air in the middle of the battlefield. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>One of them was his father.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“FATHER!!!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran’s juvenile voice resounded throughout the city’s outskirts.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>None of the beasts fighting below on either sides paid any heed to his shout and the war continued to take more lives.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>However, the Griffin King sharply turned his head towards that voice. How could he not recognise his own son’s voice?</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Ran…”</span></p>
 <br>
