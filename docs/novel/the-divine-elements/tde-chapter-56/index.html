  <br>
  <br>
  <p>—In the Axier Mansion—</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“My Lord… we just received an instant transmission from the Red Boar School”</p>
  <br>
  <p>A figure in a pitch-black outfit stated while kneeling on the floor.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Standing in front of a large ornate window was a tall grey-haired man with a stern expression on his face.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Hmm, did Felice want something?”</p>
  <br>
  <p>The grey haired man inquired as he continued to gaze at the scenery outside the window.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Uh… no, my Lord… it’s about your son.”</p>
  <br>
  <p>The assassin stumbled over his words, as he did not know how to report the news of this recent calamity.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Hearing that it was about his son, Mort abruptly turned around as his eyes pierced into the kneeling assassin.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Speak!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>A cold voice resounded in the empty room.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Knowing that there was no choice but to relay the information, the assassin started recounting in detail as he inwardly cursed his captain for making him the bearer of this tragic news.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>*Kacha*</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A bone-chilling mist spread around the room, as the glass on the windows abruptly froze and started to slowly crack under pressure!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The temperature in the room dropped to dangerous levels, and the assassin started to uncontrollably shiver as he felt the frigid energy piercing into his skin.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A wrathful expression covered Mort’s face, as he icily whispered.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“Order the guards stationed in the school to stop the tournament and to protect my son at all cost! If Roran dies, then even the Gods themselves will not be able to save Regis!”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Y-yes, my Lord!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>The kneeling assassin stammered as he hastily left the room.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>If he had stayed even a second longer around that bone-chilling mist, then his limbs would have been completely frozen!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Selia… for you, all these years I have kept my own son apart from me! But from this day forth, Roran will become my legitimate son and heir to the Axier Family!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Mort solemnly stated as a dark crystal suddenly appeared within his hands.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Mobilize the Shadow Corps! We are leaving for the Red Boar School!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Mort strictly commanded, and a quick response was immediately sounded out from the dark crystal.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“We are ready, my Lord.”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>With an explosion of a thick frosty mist, Mort suddenly vanished from the room, as a whisper echoed within the entire Axier Mansion.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“I am coming, my son… ”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>………………………..</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“YOU LITTLE BASTARD! I’LL RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Regis furiously bellowed as he leapt out of the balcony and released his essence in mid-air!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A long stream of flames erupted behind him as it enveloped his entire body.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Seeing the enraged city Lord nearing them from the sky, the crowd below all started sweating profusely as they cursed their fates for coming to the tournament!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The city Lord was infamous for disregarding the lives of commoners, and with his son in such a miserable state, they all knew that there was a very high chance of dying in the aftermath of this impending battle.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A few seconds after Regis had leapt off the balcony, the two guards behind him had immediately exited the booth and sent a quick transmission to their brothers, while they rushed towards the stadium!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Unlike the city Lord, they could not leap off the balcony from such an immense height, as they were still in the Spiritual stage, so their bodies did not have the same toughness that the experts in the Vajra stage had.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Surround the gates of the school and make sure no one leaves or enters its premises!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>One of the guards sternly yelled into a crystal in his hand.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>……………….</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“ARGH!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Calron suddenly dropped to one knee as a searing jolt of pain exploded within his veins!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>His vision started to become blurry, as his blood was being slowly consumed by the domain. Calron knew he was reaching the end of his strength, and it was only the thought of protecting Fatty that allowed him to maintain consciousness!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Ignoring the wailing Chax on the floor, Calron painstakingly crawled towards Fatty as tears streamed down his face.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>His skin was also starting to slowly revert back to its normal color as the domain began to withdraw back inside Calron.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Fatty… brother… I’m sorry, I couldn’t save you… cough”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Calron morosely whispered as he uncontrollably sobbed on the floor.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Grasping Fatty’s hand, Calron tilted his head towards the sky as he mustered up all the strength he had.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“YOU TOOK MY FAMILY! YOU STOLE MY CHILDHOOD! AND NOW, YOU TOOK AWAY THE ONLY BROTHER I HAD! DAMN YOU!”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Gasping with a lack of breath, Calron collapsed on top of Fatty!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Big… broth…er”</p>
  <br>
  <p>A faint whisper suddenly emerged from Fatty’s mouth!</p>
  <br>
  <p>Hearing that familiar voice, Calron felt his heart thumping against his chest as he abruptly opened his eyes to confirm that Fatty was still alive.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Fatty!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Calron wiped away his tears as an immense feeling of elation spread throughout his body. Firmly grasping Fatty’s hand, Calron slowly smiled as he realized that Fatty was still alive!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“YOU FILTHY LITTLE SHIT!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>A furious roar suddenly erupted behind Calron, as Regis landed onto the stage with a loud explosion!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Seeing his father arrive, Chax felt a surge of hope within his heart, as he knew that he could get his revenge now. Never in his life had he been this humiliated, and today’s memory would scar him forever!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Calron would have to die for him to be ever at peace!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Father… “</p>
  <br>
  <p>Chax hoarsely whispered as he tried to stand up. His throat was completely parched from the screams and cries evoked under Calron’s torture.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Son… I will destroy these two for you, so hang in here!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Regis fiercely declared, as he turned to face Calron and Fatty.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Flames unceasingly flowed on top of his body as an oppressive aura surged around him. The pressure it exuded immediately forced Calron to the ground and prevented him from making a single movement.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“I will slowly skin your flesh and make you scream until even your ancestors will hear your cries of agony, and only then, when your soul is on the verge of insanity, will I take your life!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Regis coldly stated as he leisurely walked towards the two boys.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Calron knew that he was no match for a Vajra stage expert, especially after activating the Titan’s Fury, and he realised that&nbsp;there was nothing he could do at this moment! If not for his tremendous willpower, Calron would have long ago collapsed from the strain of using the Blood Legacy’s domain!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Calron’s current blood quantity was at dangerous levels, and if he even attempted to activate the Titan’s Fury again, then his body would immediately crumble apart!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Regis suddenly raised his arm, as a large ball of scalding flames gathered within his palm.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The ground beneath Regis started to crack apart from the intense heat radiating from him, but he showed no signs of stopping.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Fatty clasped Calron’s hand as he struggled to sound out his words.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“Big broth… er, you sh… ould lea…ve”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Haha, Fatty, if we die today, I will make sure to at least take out as many of these bastards as I can!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Calron fearlessly stated, as he saw the guards with the bear insignia on their chest plates slowly gather around the stage.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>The crowd slowly stepped back as the black armored guards completely encircled the stage as they waited for their Lord to issue orders.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Just as Calron resigned himself to his fate and was about to summon the Azure Lightning, a sudden surge of bright cyan essence erupted within the crowd!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Lord Regis, you will step down from that stage immediately or I will personally kill your son right now!”</p>
  <br>
  <p>A cold and frosty voice echoed around the Arena, as Felice started to slowly walk towards Calron and Fatty.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Previously, when she had seen her brother abruptly move, Felice immediately regained her composure as a sudden elation spread within her, but before she could even rejoice, she saw that the city Lord was preparing to attack her brother!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
  <br>
  <p>Regis angrily asked as his eyes bore into Felice.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Suddenly, a series of shadows flashed across the stage!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Just as&nbsp;Felice was about to respond, a tall figure in an assassin’s outfit abruptly stepped in front of her.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Facing the city Lord, the assassin icily stated.</p>
  <br>
  <p>“Any further threats against the Axier family, and you shall forfeit your life!”</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>.</p>
  <br>
  <p>.</p>

 <p>His vision started to become blurry, as his blood was being slowly consumed by the domain. Calron knew he was reaching the end of his strength, and it was only the thought of protecting Fatty that allowed him to maintain consciousness!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Ignoring the wailing Chax on the floor, Calron painstakingly crawled towards Fatty as tears streamed down his face.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>His skin was also starting to slowly revert back to its normal color as the domain began to withdraw back inside Calron.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Fatty… brother… I’m sorry, I couldn’t save you… cough”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Calron morosely whispered as he uncontrollably sobbed on the floor.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Grasping Fatty’s hand, Calron tilted his head towards the sky as he mustered up all the strength he had.</p>
 <br>
 <p>“YOU TOOK MY FAMILY! YOU STOLE MY CHILDHOOD! AND NOW, YOU TOOK AWAY THE ONLY BROTHER I HAD! DAMN YOU!”</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Gasping with a lack of breath, Calron collapsed on top of Fatty!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Big… broth…er”</p>
 <br>
 <p>A faint whisper suddenly emerged from Fatty’s mouth!</p>
 <br>
 <p>Hearing that familiar voice, Calron felt his heart thumping against his chest as he abruptly opened his eyes to confirm that Fatty was still alive.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Fatty!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Calron wiped away his tears as an immense feeling of elation spread throughout his body. Firmly grasping Fatty’s hand, Calron slowly smiled as he realized that Fatty was still alive!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“YOU FILTHY LITTLE SHIT!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>A furious roar suddenly erupted behind Calron, as Regis landed onto the stage with a loud explosion!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Seeing his father arrive, Chax felt a surge of hope within his heart, as he knew that he could get his revenge now. Never in his life had he been this humiliated, and today’s memory would scar him forever!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Calron would have to die for him to be ever at peace!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Father… “</p>
 <br>
 <p>Chax hoarsely whispered as he tried to stand up. His throat was completely parched from the screams and cries evoked under Calron’s torture.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Son… I will destroy these two for you, so hang in here!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Regis fiercely declared, as he turned to face Calron and Fatty.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Flames unceasingly flowed on top of his body as an oppressive aura surged around him. The pressure it exuded immediately forced Calron to the ground and prevented him from making a single movement.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“I will slowly skin your flesh and make you scream until even your ancestors will hear your cries of agony, and only then, when your soul is on the verge of insanity, will I take your life!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Regis coldly stated as he leisurely walked towards the two boys.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Calron knew that he was no match for a Vajra stage expert, especially after activating the Titan’s Fury, and he realised that&nbsp;there was nothing he could do at this moment! If not for his tremendous willpower, Calron would have long ago collapsed from the strain of using the Blood Legacy’s domain!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Calron’s current blood quantity was at dangerous levels, and if he even attempted to activate the Titan’s Fury again, then his body would immediately crumble apart!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Regis suddenly raised his arm, as a large ball of scalding flames gathered within his palm.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>The ground beneath Regis started to crack apart from the intense heat radiating from him, but he showed no signs of stopping.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Fatty clasped Calron’s hand as he struggled to sound out his words.</p>
 <br>
 <p>“Big broth… er, you sh… ould lea…ve”</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Haha, Fatty, if we die today, I will make sure to at least take out as many of these bastards as I can!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Calron fearlessly stated, as he saw the guards with the bear insignia on their chest plates slowly gather around the stage.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>The crowd slowly stepped back as the black armored guards completely encircled the stage as they waited for their Lord to issue orders.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Just as Calron resigned himself to his fate and was about to summon the Azure Lightning, a sudden surge of bright cyan essence erupted within the crowd!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Lord Regis, you will step down from that stage immediately or I will personally kill your son right now!”</p>
 <br>
 <p>A cold and frosty voice echoed around the Arena, as Felice started to slowly walk towards Calron and Fatty.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Previously, when she had seen her brother abruptly move, Felice immediately regained her composure as a sudden elation spread within her, but before she could even rejoice, she saw that the city Lord was preparing to attack her brother!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
 <br>
 <p>Regis angrily asked as his eyes bore into Felice.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Suddenly, a series of shadows flashed across the stage!</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Just as&nbsp;Felice was about to respond, a tall figure in an assassin’s outfit abruptly stepped in front of her.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Facing the city Lord, the assassin icily stated.</p>
 <br>
 <p>“Any further threats against the Axier family, and you shall forfeit your life!”</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>.</p>
 <br>
 <p>.</p>
 <br>
