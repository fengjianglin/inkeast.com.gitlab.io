  <br>
  <p style="text-align: left"><br><span style>BOOOOM!</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron felt as if the entire bones within his body completely shattered under the impact of the Elder’s punch. Surprisingly, he was still standing and not collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Ho- *cough* how?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron spat out a mouthful of blood, staring intensely into the bright eyes of the Elder’s owlish face.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It did not take long for the Blood Legacy’s regeneration ability to kick in, rapidly healing Calron’s battered body.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Unnoticed by Calron, the Elder’s eyes glimmered momentarily when he sensed the presence of the Blood Legacy’s unique source energy.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>So, I was not mistaken… this boy has indeed inherited a strange legacy. However, that still does not explain how he was able to withstand the might of a Heavenly stage cultivator. </span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder pondered inwardly while letting out a sharp bird’s cry. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Pay attention and fight seriously, child. Next time, I will not be going this easy.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>Curse the heavens! Why is this geezer after me?</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron lamented, as he closed his eyes and soon waves of flames burst all across his body.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Tit..tan’s Fury!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Letting out a hoarse whisper, streams of blood-red source energy rushed into Calron’s muscles, turning his skin akin to that of a fiery crimson dragon.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Unlike in the past, Calron’s body had awakened his beastial heritage and his muscles and flesh were now incomparably stronger than of a human, letting him to utilise the full potential of the Titan’s Fury technique without harming his body.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I do not know why you are doing this, but if it is a fight that you want… then I will give you one!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With a savage roar, Calron bolted towards the Elder while wisps of flames swirled over his skin. Furthermore, a hazy image of a colossal giant appeared above Calron’s head as he darted ahead with a burning fury.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“That is all I ask.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder replied calmly with a slight smile.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Booom!</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A tiny explosion occurred the moment Calron’s fist landed on the Elder’s chest.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Hmm, your physical strength is not bad for a Vajra stage expert. It might even be comparable to the body of a low ranked Saint cultivator.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder murmured while nodding his head.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>This bastard is just toying with me.</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron cursed within his mind while simultaneously increasing the speed of his attacks.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Boom! Booom! Boom! Boooom!</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A series of minuscule explosions reverberated throughout the empty area, driving away any nearby beasts that were previously lurking.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Is this your limit?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder shook his head in disappointment as he gazed down at the defeated form of Calron below him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*puchi*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron coughed out a globule of blood, as flashes of lightning flickered across his pupils. Even though he knew that he was no match for an expert at the peak Saint stage with his cultivation of the Vajra stage, but he could not help but feel an immense anger at his powerlessness.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It was at this moment that the Azure Lightning within his core started to rumble, and tiny streaks of blue creeped into the golden lightning flashing inside Calron’s eyes.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>Kid, calm down. We still do not what the purpose of this old man is and it is better not to reveal any more information about you.</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Ezkael’s voice drifted within Calron’s mind, haltering the movement of the Azure Lightning.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>Then what am I supposed to fight him with? Titan’s Fury is the furthest seal that I have achieved and without opening the others, I cannot use the full power of the legacy.</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron rasped, regretting not training more with the Blood Legacy Arts and breaking the seal of the other abilities.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>At that moment, a faint tingle started to jolt near Calron’s elemental core.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Huh? This essence fluctuation…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder abruptly turned his head, detecting a primal essence with Calron which was starkly unlike his original lightning essence.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“This is the first time that I have seen it react like this… why now?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron murmured, while slowly raising his blood-soaked arm.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*shua*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Traces of blackish purple lightning surged around Calron’s arm as a translucent dark bow started to form.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Since the time that Calron had obtained the bow, it had not once reacted like this and even though the dark metallic bow appeared fearsome, Calron did not truly sense any overwhelming power from it until now.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The reason Calron hardly ever utilised the bow was because it consumed an astonishing amount of essence. Moreover, Calron was a close-range fighter who used his fists and body to trample opponents, but a bow was close to useless in fights like these. Hence, he had only used the bow in rare occasions when hunting for a beast.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“A bow? Pointless…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder sighed when he saw that the weapon in Calron’s hand was simply a bow.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Although the dark metallic bow emitted a frightening amount of power, in a close-range battle like this one, it would not help Calron at all. If it were a sword or a spear, the Elder’s sentiment might have been different.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Screw it.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron coldly stated, as he tightly gripped the bow in his hand and prepared to lunge at the Elder. He did not even notice that the metallic bow which previously used to be extremely heavy was now light as a feather in his hand.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Swerving the bow to the right, a flame of anger ignited within Calron’s eyes as he was almost upon the Elder.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Realising the direction of Calron’s thoughts, Ezkael yelled in indignation. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>You stinking brat! This is godly bow that even the Ancients would bleed for, how can you use it like a common club!?</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron knew that the Elder would not give him ample time to coalesce an essence arrow, so instead he decided to use the bow as a tool for bashing. Unlike Calron, Ezkael knew the history behind the dark metallic bow known as ‘Thunder’s Hand’, so how could he silently watch his student spitting on its celestial reputation?</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Even the Elder was shocked by the human boy’s tactics, that he failed to deflect the hard metallic body of the bow when it viciously struck him on his cheek.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*clunk*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The sound of metal hitting on metal ringed in the quiet forest. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It was not surprising that the body of the Elder was as strong as steel with his cultivation nearing the Heavenly stage.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, Calron did not stop there. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Once the Elder was distracted by the blow, he immediately leapt into the air and sent all the essence stored within his core into the dark bow.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Numerous patterns etched onto the bow instantly shone with a brilliant golden light, and a string of lightning connected the two limbs of the bow forming a sparking drawstring.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron relentlessly forced more of his essence into the bow, knowing that he would need a lot more to injure someone like the Elder with his Vajra stage cultivation.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, the moment when the entire essence within his body was pushed into the bow, a thin steak of purple energy emerged from Calron and flowed into the bow.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*Thump* &nbsp;&nbsp;*Thump*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The dark bow suddenly felt alive with a heartbeat as it thrummed under Calron’s hand.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><em><span style>H-he actually awakened the primordial spirit within the bow!</span></em></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Ezkael gasped with a slight tremor to his voice.</span></p>

 <p><em><span style>Then what am I supposed to fight him with? Titan’s Fury is the furthest seal that I have achieved and without opening the others, I cannot use the full power of the legacy.</span></em></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron rasped, regretting not training more with the Blood Legacy Arts and breaking the seal of the other abilities.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a faint tingle started to jolt near Calron’s elemental core.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Huh? This essence fluctuation…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The Elder abruptly turned his head, detecting a primal essence with Calron which was starkly unlike his original lightning essence.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“This is the first time that I have seen it react like this… why now?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron murmured, while slowly raising his blood-soaked arm.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*shua*</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Traces of blackish purple lightning surged around Calron’s arm as a translucent dark bow started to form.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Since the time that Calron had obtained the bow, it had not once reacted like this and even though the dark metallic bow appeared fearsome, Calron did not truly sense any overwhelming power from it until now.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The reason Calron hardly ever utilised the bow was because it consumed an astonishing amount of essence. Moreover, Calron was a close-range fighter who used his fists and body to trample opponents, but a bow was close to useless in fights like these. Hence, he had only used the bow in rare occasions when hunting for a beast.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“A bow? Pointless…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The Elder sighed when he saw that the weapon in Calron’s hand was simply a bow.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Although the dark metallic bow emitted a frightening amount of power, in a close-range battle like this one, it would not help Calron at all. If it were a sword or a spear, the Elder’s sentiment might have been different.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Screw it.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron coldly stated, as he tightly gripped the bow in his hand and prepared to lunge at the Elder. He did not even notice that the metallic bow which previously used to be extremely heavy was now light as a feather in his hand.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Swerving the bow to the right, a flame of anger ignited within Calron’s eyes as he was almost upon the Elder.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Realising the direction of Calron’s thoughts, Ezkael yelled in indignation. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><em><span style>You stinking brat! This is godly bow that even the Ancients would bleed for, how can you use it like a common club!?</span></em></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron knew that the Elder would not give him ample time to coalesce an essence arrow, so instead he decided to use the bow as a tool for bashing. Unlike Calron, Ezkael knew the history behind the dark metallic bow known as ‘Thunder’s Hand’, so how could he silently watch his student spitting on its celestial reputation?</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Even the Elder was shocked by the human boy’s tactics, that he failed to deflect the hard metallic body of the bow when it viciously struck him on his cheek.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*clunk*</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The sound of metal hitting on metal ringed in the quiet forest. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>It was not surprising that the body of the Elder was as strong as steel with his cultivation nearing the Heavenly stage.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>However, Calron did not stop there. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Once the Elder was distracted by the blow, he immediately leapt into the air and sent all the essence stored within his core into the dark bow.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Numerous patterns etched onto the bow instantly shone with a brilliant golden light, and a string of lightning connected the two limbs of the bow forming a sparking drawstring.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron relentlessly forced more of his essence into the bow, knowing that he would need a lot more to injure someone like the Elder with his Vajra stage cultivation.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>However, the moment when the entire essence within his body was pushed into the bow, a thin steak of purple energy emerged from Calron and flowed into the bow.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*Thump* &nbsp;&nbsp;*Thump*</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The dark bow suddenly felt alive with a heartbeat as it thrummed under Calron’s hand.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><em><span style>H-he actually awakened the primordial spirit within the bow!</span></em></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Ezkael gasped with a slight tremor to his voice.</span></p>
