  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Human, we have a major crisis on our hands.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Tarnila seriously stated, as she walked towards Calron with Rebran in tow behind her. Avi appeared to be taking a nap off in the distance under the shade of a tree.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I know, Laris told me just before she left.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron replied while gazing in the direction that the blue-skinned woman had just departed.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>He was still not sure how he felt about her and what she said about the Dragon King, but he knew one thing for sure: she did not tell a single lie the whole time she was with him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“No, the problem is not the war – it’s him!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The raccoon sighed, turning her head to glance at a nervous Rebran.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Huh? What does he have to do with the war?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron asked with a confused expression.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Tell him.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Tarnila urged the young lion by nudging his shoulder.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Um, the one who is waging the war on this city is probably my father…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The lion whispered, hanging his head down. Rebran anxiously looked up at Calron to see his reaction.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, contrary to what he was expecting, the golden bird remained static and emotionless.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Hahaha, it doesn’t get any better than this! So, kid, what do you plan on doing now?</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Ezkael roared with laughter, amused that his student had found yet another problem that latched onto him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Dammit! I knew I should have taken him more seriously when he said that he was the son of a king. I thought he was just a random beast separated from his guardians… besides, what the hell am I supposed to do in this situation? </span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron inwardly thought.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Well, the choice is up to you. I cannot tell you each time what the best course of action is. Whatever you decide, I will support you.</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Voice said with a slight smile.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>He was proud of how much Calron had grown from the dark and moody child that he was a few years ago, and to the man he was becoming right in front of his eyes. Although his student might complain about the baby beasts, it was their very presence that had slowly brought out a compassionate side to Calron.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With Avi, the boy now had someone to care for and he knew that he was not alone in this world any more. His student needed to learn to let others into his life and not shut them off, and that’s why Ezkael wanted Calron to make this choice on his own.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Sigh, you already know what my answer is, don’t you?</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron stated as he briefly closed his eyes.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Haha, well, you are my student!</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Ezkael replied, and Calron was sure that his Teacher was currently grinning.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll make sure he reaches safely back to his father, and hopefully that will put an end to this stupid war.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron spoke out, abruptly opening his eyes and glancing at Tarnila.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“How did you know I was going to ask you that?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The raccoon asked with both her eyebrows raised in surprise.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“If you were going to do it yourself, then you would not have come to me. Also, take care of Avi until I return.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron responded to Tarnila with a slight smile.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Get on my back, Rebran, and let’s go stop this war before it blows out of proportion.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron commanded the young lion as he slowly brought his body closer to the ground.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Eh? Y-you are not mad that my father is here to capture your city?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran stuttered, but began to quickly climb onto the bird’s back.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*whoosh-whoosh*</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron started to vigorously flap his powerful wings, and turned his head back to answer the young beast.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“You got one thing wrong, Rebran… this is not my city.” &nbsp;</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*SCREEEEEE*</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With a thundering screech, a massive golden bird spread into the sky.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“This human surprises me with each passing day.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The raccoon whispered to herself, gazing at the disappearing figure of the large bird.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>She did not show it on her face, but Tarnila had been shocked at the rapid pace at which Calron had adapted to the lightning techniques that she taught. Usually, any cultivator would feel a draining amount of resistance from their lightning element when they commanded it to follow their wishes, but for Calron, the lightning simply obeyed.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“It’s at times like these that being an Elder is more useless than being a common soldier… I wonder how the others are doing…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The raccoon muttered quietly while picking up the sleeping wolf pup and vanishing from her spot under sparks of lightning.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>………………………</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Tell me when you see them.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron yelled back to Rebran, as he flew over the city.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The whole place was in chaos with beasts wildly running around and gathering all their close ones and loading their belongings onto a caravan. Simple citizens had no way of protecting themselves against combat-trained beasts, and the only option that they had was to run to a safe distance until their own army prevailed over the enemy.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I d-don’t see them!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran shouted back as his head darted back and forth at the scenery below.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>His mind was in shambles, seeing the panic and fright written over all of these beasts’ faces. The children kept crying as they held onto their mother’s legs, asking why they had to move and why everyone was so afraid. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The cause of this entire situation was one person.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>His father.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*Thump-Thump*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“No… please not now…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran groaned with pain, as he tightly clutched his chest.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It was acting up again.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>I must find father… I need to stop this!</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The young beast’s thoughts raced on, desperately trying to push back the pain.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Hey kid, what is happening? Are you alright?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron inquired, sensing that something was strange with Rebran.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Yes, I’m alri-“</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, Rebran’s eyes rolled back and he started to lose his conscious.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Oh f*ck!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron cursed, as he summoned his lightning essence and sent it all towards his wings.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>BOOOOOOOM!</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With the sound of an explosion, Calron’s figure rapidly vanished from above the city and towards an isolated alley.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>While mid-air, Calron quickly transformed back into his human form and gripped Rebran’s body as it was falling down.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Gently placing the beast on the ground, Calron checked his heart-rate and breathing.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Not good… it’s worse than last time. Is his disease something more than crippled meridians?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron pondered, as he tried shaking Rebran to rouse him awake.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Hearing the distant sounds of chaos, Calron felt helpless as he stared down at the immature youth in front of him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>His emotions were in turmoil. On one hand, there was a possibility that this entire war could be stopped with Rebran’s interference, and on the other, if Calron decided to go along with what his heart was telling him, then there might be unpredicted consequences to his actions in future. </span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>No matter what, I believe in you, kid.</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Ezkael’s soft voice breezed from the side of Calron’s mind, soothing his thoughts.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I hope my feelings are right about this one, Teacher…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron breathed out, and in the next instant, his eyes turned to a dark crimson red.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Bringing his right palm to his teeth, Calron bit on it until traces of blood started to flow.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“From this day on forth, you will walk the same bloody path as me. This is our legacy, Rebran, the legacy of blood…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Slowly, Calron placed his wounded palm over young lion’s forehead.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“How did you know I was going to ask you that?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The raccoon asked with both her eyebrows raised in surprise.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“If you were going to do it yourself, then you would not have come to me. Also, take care of Avi until I return.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron responded to Tarnila with a slight smile.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Get on my back, Rebran, and let’s go stop this war before it blows out of proportion.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron commanded the young lion as he slowly brought his body closer to the ground.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Y-you are not mad that my father is here to capture your city?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran stuttered, but began to quickly climb onto the bird’s back.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*whoosh-whoosh*</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron started to vigorously flap his powerful wings, and turned his head back to answer the young beast.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“You got one thing wrong, Rebran… this is not my city.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*SCREEEEEE*</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>With a thundering screech, a massive golden bird spread into the sky.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“This human surprises me with each passing day.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The raccoon whispered to herself, gazing at the disappearing figure of the large bird.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>She did not show it on her face, but Tarnila had been shocked at the rapid pace at which Calron had adapted to the lightning techniques that she taught. Usually, any cultivator would feel a draining amount of resistance from their lightning element when they commanded it to follow their wishes, but for Calron, the lightning simply obeyed.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“It’s at times like these that being an Elder is more useless than being a common soldier… I wonder how the others are doing…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The raccoon muttered quietly while picking up the sleeping wolf pup and vanishing from her spot under sparks of lightning.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>………………………</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Tell me when you see them.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron yelled back to Rebran, as he flew over the city.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The whole place was in chaos with beasts wildly running around and gathering all their close ones and loading their belongings onto a caravan. Simple citizens had no way of protecting themselves against combat-trained beasts, and the only option that they had was to run to a safe distance until their own army prevailed over the enemy.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I d-don’t see them!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran shouted back as his head darted back and forth at the scenery below.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>His mind was in shambles, seeing the panic and fright written over all of these beasts’ faces. The children kept crying as they held onto their mother’s legs, asking why they had to move and why everyone was so afraid. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The cause of this entire situation was one person.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>His father.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*Thump-Thump*</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“No… please not now…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran groaned with pain, as he tightly clutched his chest.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>It was acting up again.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><i><span style>I must find father… I need to stop this!</span></i></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The young beast’s thoughts raced on, desperately trying to push back the pain.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Hey kid, what is happening? Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron inquired, sensing that something was strange with Rebran.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I’m alri-“</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Rebran’s eyes rolled back and he started to lose his conscious.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Oh f*ck!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron cursed, as he summoned his lightning essence and sent it all towards his wings.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>BOOOOOOOM!</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>With the sound of an explosion, Calron’s figure rapidly vanished from above the city and towards an isolated alley.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>While mid-air, Calron quickly transformed back into his human form and gripped Rebran’s body as it was falling down.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Gently placing the beast on the ground, Calron checked his heart-rate and breathing.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Not good… it’s worse than last time. Is his disease something more than crippled meridians?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron pondered, as he tried shaking Rebran to rouse him awake.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Hearing the distant sounds of chaos, Calron felt helpless as he stared down at the immature youth in front of him.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>His emotions were in turmoil. On one hand, there was a possibility that this entire war could be stopped with Rebran’s interference, and on the other, if Calron decided to go along with what his heart was telling him, then there might be unpredicted consequences to his actions in future. </span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I believe in you, kid.</span></i></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Ezkael’s soft voice breezed from the side of Calron’s mind, soothing his thoughts.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I hope my feelings are right about this one, Teacher…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron breathed out, and in the next instant, his eyes turned to a dark crimson red.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Bringing his right palm to his teeth, Calron bit on it until traces of blood started to flow.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“From this day on forth, you will walk the same bloody path as me. This is our legacy, Rebran, the legacy of blood…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Slowly, Calron placed his wounded palm over young lion’s forehead.</span></p>
