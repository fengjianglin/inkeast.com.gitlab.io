  <br>
  <p>“Elder, what is wrong with him?”</p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Whispers of someone talking could be heard in the silent room.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“It looks to be a rare case of crippled meridians. I’m sorry, Xardoth, but your son will never be able to cultivate or awaken to an element for the rest of his life.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A low and ancient voice stated in a severe tone.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Is there truly no cure for him?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth asked, as he tried to control the trembling of his voice.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“There might be a few pills in the human continent that could possibly cure him, but even then, we can be never sure. Besides, the human alchemists will never sell their wares to beasts like us…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Elder sighed, and left the room, leaving the father and the sleeping son alone in their company.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I will never let anyone hurt you, Ran…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth muttered, gripping the soft and furry paw of his only child.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>……………….</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Are you telling the truth, Ran? Show mommy quickly!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Denela hurried over to her son, swiftly transforming back to her humanoid form and grasping Rebran’s little shoulders.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The eight year old lion’s eyes lit up with happiness, and he slowly raised his paw and summoned a bright ball of light.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Looking at the ball of essence floating above her son’s palm, Denela started weeping with tears of joy on her face and hugged Rebran’s tiny form against her.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It was clear from the essence that her son had awakened to one of the rarest elements in the entire continent: the element of light.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, before the elated mother could revel in the feeling of hope, her son abruptly cried out in agony and collapsed onto the ground. The ball of light dissipated in an instant while Rebran’s body twitched uncontrollably on the floor.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“XARDOTH!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Denela shouted in panic, as she quickly dropped to the ground and checked her son’s pulse.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“This does not make any sense! If his meridians are crippled, how did he awaken to an element!?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Griffin King furiously yelled.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Hush, Xar, he is starting to wake up…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A woman’s soft voice sounded out from next to Rebran’s ear.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Mo…ther…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran wheezed, his eyelids fluttering to open.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Ran! How are you, sweetie? Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Denela asked while lightly stroking her son’s cheek.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“What is… happ…ening to me?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The little lion breathed out, gazing into his mother’s eyes and seeing the traces of worry there.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Everything is fine, Ran. Don’t worry… mother will not let anything happen to you.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Denela whispered with a smile, but even the little lion with his hazy vision could see the tears streaming down her face.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*Shua* &nbsp;&nbsp;*Shua*</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The sound of powerful waves crashing against each other reverberated within Rebran’s ears.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It sounded like the waves in the ocean.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Open your eyes, Rebran, and see what is in front of you.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A familiar voice sounded out from behind the lion.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Slowly opening his eyes to a crimson world filled with blood, Rebran gawked at the sheer pressure that the waves emitted.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“That is the source energy of our legacy, and it is also where you will draw your strength from.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron’s voice breezed in the vicinity of the source pool.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Glancing around, the young lion could not detect any traces of him, so he guessed that Calron had some kind of mental connection with this place.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“It’s beginning, get ready…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The voice stated, as it gradually grew quieter towards the end.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><i><span style>Huh? What is beginning?</span></i></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran pondered while continuing to gaze at the crashing crimson waves.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Suddenly, his heart started to rapidly pound against his chest. Rebran had no control over it, and was utterly befuddled as to what was happening within his body.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>*swoosh*</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A small bridge smoothly rose up from the blood ocean and attached itself to the source pool. In the next moment, tendrils of bright white essence coiled around the bridge, illuminating it with a celestial glow.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran felt an inexplicable urge to go towards it. It was somehow connected to his soul, and he could feel it calling him.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I will explain all of this later, Rebran, but we simply do not have enough time. Let’s go!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron sent out a mental shout, forcefully pulling the lion out of the legacy’s source pool and back into the real world.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“haaah, haah, what in the heavens was that?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran gasped with astonishment as he awoke from his slumber, and saw a nervous Calron staring back into his face.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Seeing that the young beast was fine, Calron heaved a quick sigh and began to hurriedly shape-shift back into the golden bird.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“No time to explain. Get on my back, we need to find your father!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Truthfully, Calron had been anxious throughout Rebran’s inheritance of the Blood Legacy, as he did not know how the legacy would affect a beast, and whether or not he could actually pass the legacy on.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Even right now, Calron did not understand how he did it. If it was simply coating the blood on someone’s face, then his blood had been on others but did not cause them to inherit the legacy. Maybe, there had to be a will of the Prime Inheritor to pass it on?</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Pushing away all these thoughts, Calron urged Rebran to hurry so they could get back to the city.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“Hey, can you at least tell me what this thing is called?”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Rebran asked, as he scrambled on top of Calron’s scaly back.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“It’s known as… the Blood Legacy.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Calron whispered with a powerful flap of his wings, and rushed towards the city.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>He could only pray that nothing disastrous would come out of his decision today. With these pressing thoughts surging within his mind, he even forgot to check whether or not the young lion was finally cured of his disease.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>…………………</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“WEIR! YOU DESPICABLE BASTARD! BRING OUT MY SONNN!!!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A gigantic griffin charged towards the city’s gates, as his soul-crushing bellow echoed in the entire area.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With mighty gales of wind surging around his body like a series of mini hurricanes, the Griffin King spread his enormous wings as he furiously searched for his enemy.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“I do not know what you are talking about, Xardoth, but this is foolish. You have as much to lose as me, if you continue to pursue this idiotic war.”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>A calm and tranquil voice thundered above the air, as a colossal silver dragon descended down from the clouds above.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>His scales shone with a brilliant metallic luster, and a mysterious silver mist escaped from both his mouth and nostrils. The sight of the striking dragon was enough to cause a seed of fear to take root within the hearts of Xardoth’s troops.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Dragons were an elusive species that never ventured into the outer ranges of the Desolate Mountains, and their tribe was said to be one of the most powerful among the beasts. Seeing the savage aura circling around the Dragon King, none of the troops on either side of the war doubted his statement.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>However, at this moment, the Griffin King was not any less impressive with a brutal and murderous aura surrounding him, and an elite squad of armored griffins hovering behind.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Gradually, a few figures treaded out from the city’s gates and some of them flew up and joined the silver dragon, while the others calmly continued to walk towards the front of the army.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The Nobles had finally come out.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“DON’T PLAY DUMB WITH ME, WEIR! I WILL DRAG YOU BY YOUR SCALY ASS IN FRONT OF YOUR CITIZENS AND CHOP EACH OF YOUR LIMBS UNTIL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Xardoth showed no signs of calming down, and instead his fury continued to increase like a hot furnace.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“You truly do not know when to stop, Xardoth…”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Weir whispered with a deathly iciness to his voice, as wisps of frosty air erupted out from the dragon’s maw.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>It appeared as if the Dragon King had finally lost his patience.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>“CHARGE!”</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>With a domineering command, Weir ordered the Nobles to draw the first blood of the war.</span></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Multiple bestial roars resounded in the land, as some of the most powerful beasts within the kingdom prepared to kill and fight.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>Within seconds, the entire land outside the city had turned into a bloody battlefield as beasts on both sides took part in the carnage.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>The two Kings stared into each other’s eyes as they remained motionless in the sky. </span></p>
  <br>
  <p><span style>This was a battle taking place in the soul realm.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Rebran wheezed, his eyelids fluttering to open.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Ran! How are you, sweetie? Does it still hurt?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Denela asked while lightly stroking her son’s cheek.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“What is… happ…ening to me?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The little lion breathed out, gazing into his mother’s eyes and seeing the traces of worry there.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Everything is fine, Ran. Don’t worry… mother will not let anything happen to you.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Denela whispered with a smile, but even the little lion with his hazy vision could see the tears streaming down her face.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>…………………..</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*Shua* &nbsp;&nbsp;*Shua*</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The sound of powerful waves crashing against each other reverberated within Rebran’s ears.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>It sounded like the waves in the ocean.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Open your eyes, Rebran, and see what is in front of you.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>A familiar voice sounded out from behind the lion.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Slowly opening his eyes to a crimson world filled with blood, Rebran gawked at the sheer pressure that the waves emitted.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“That is the source energy of our legacy, and it is also where you will draw your strength from.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron’s voice breezed in the vicinity of the source pool.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Glancing around, the young lion could not detect any traces of him, so he guessed that Calron had some kind of mental connection with this place.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“It’s beginning, get ready…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The voice stated, as it gradually grew quieter towards the end.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><i><span style>Huh? What is beginning?</span></i></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran pondered while continuing to gaze at the crashing crimson waves.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, his heart started to rapidly pound against his chest. Rebran had no control over it, and was utterly befuddled as to what was happening within his body.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>*swoosh*</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>A small bridge smoothly rose up from the blood ocean and attached itself to the source pool. In the next moment, tendrils of bright white essence coiled around the bridge, illuminating it with a celestial glow.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran felt an inexplicable urge to go towards it. It was somehow connected to his soul, and he could feel it calling him.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I will explain all of this later, Rebran, but we simply do not have enough time. Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron sent out a mental shout, forcefully pulling the lion out of the legacy’s source pool and back into the real world.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“haaah, haah, what in the heavens was that?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran gasped with astonishment as he awoke from his slumber, and saw a nervous Calron staring back into his face.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the young beast was fine, Calron heaved a quick sigh and began to hurriedly shape-shift back into the golden bird.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“No time to explain. Get on my back, we need to find your father!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Truthfully, Calron had been anxious throughout Rebran’s inheritance of the Blood Legacy, as he did not know how the legacy would affect a beast, and whether or not he could actually pass the legacy on.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Even right now, Calron did not understand how he did it. If it was simply coating the blood on someone’s face, then his blood had been on others but did not cause them to inherit the legacy. Maybe, there had to be a will of the Prime Inheritor to pass it on?</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Pushing away all these thoughts, Calron urged Rebran to hurry so they could get back to the city.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“Hey, can you at least tell me what this thing is called?”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Rebran asked, as he scrambled on top of Calron’s scaly back.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“It’s known as… the Blood Legacy.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Calron whispered with a powerful flap of his wings, and rushed towards the city.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>He could only pray that nothing disastrous would come out of his decision today. With these pressing thoughts surging within his mind, he even forgot to check whether or not the young lion was finally cured of his disease.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>…………………</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“WEIR! YOU DESPICABLE BASTARD! BRING OUT MY SONNN!!!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>A gigantic griffin charged towards the city’s gates, as his soul-crushing bellow echoed in the entire area.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>With mighty gales of wind surging around his body like a series of mini hurricanes, the Griffin King spread his enormous wings as he furiously searched for his enemy.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“I do not know what you are talking about, Xardoth, but this is foolish. You have as much to lose as me, if you continue to pursue this idiotic war.”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>A calm and tranquil voice thundered above the air, as a colossal silver dragon descended down from the clouds above.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>His scales shone with a brilliant metallic luster, and a mysterious silver mist escaped from both his mouth and nostrils. The sight of the striking dragon was enough to cause a seed of fear to take root within the hearts of Xardoth’s troops.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Dragons were an elusive species that never ventured into the outer ranges of the Desolate Mountains, and their tribe was said to be one of the most powerful among the beasts. Seeing the savage aura circling around the Dragon King, none of the troops on either side of the war doubted his statement.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>However, at this moment, the Griffin King was not any less impressive with a brutal and murderous aura surrounding him, and an elite squad of armored griffins hovering behind.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Gradually, a few figures treaded out from the city’s gates and some of them flew up and joined the silver dragon, while the others calmly continued to walk towards the front of the army.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The Nobles had finally come out.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“DON’T PLAY DUMB WITH ME, WEIR! I WILL DRAG YOU BY YOUR SCALY ASS IN FRONT OF YOUR CITIZENS AND CHOP EACH OF YOUR LIMBS UNTIL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Xardoth showed no signs of calming down, and instead his fury continued to increase like a hot furnace.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“You truly do not know when to stop, Xardoth…”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Weir whispered with a deathly iciness to his voice, as wisps of frosty air erupted out from the dragon’s maw.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>It appeared as if the Dragon King had finally lost his patience.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>“CHARGE!”</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>With a domineering command, Weir ordered the Nobles to draw the first blood of the war.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Multiple bestial roars resounded in the land, as some of the most powerful beasts within the kingdom prepared to kill and fight.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>Within seconds, the entire land outside the city had turned into a bloody battlefield as beasts on both sides took part in the carnage.</span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>The two Kings stared into each other’s eyes as they remained motionless in the sky. </span></p>
 <br>
 <p><span style>This was a battle taking place in the soul realm.</span></p>
