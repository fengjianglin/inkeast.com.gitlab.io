 <p><strong>Chapter 192 – Hierarchy </strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calron tilted his head up to look at the Patriarch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two were standing near a small pond, waiting for the rest of the members to arrive. Calron was supposed to have a class with Kail this morning, but the Patriarch insisted that they leave early so Calron’s attention would not be disturbed by a stressful class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That kid’s got no talent when it comes to teaching, he’ll just mess up your mood instead of teaching you anything useful. Today’s mission is important since you’ll be working with some of the other towers’ young generation, so I need you to be in the best condition, both mentally and physically.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Patriarch responded, turning his head to the side as he detected the arrival of the other members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calron did not say anything, but he had a feeling that Uncle Kail would take it out on him when they next met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, around a dozen figures neared the pond and stopped in front of Calron and the Patriarch. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tower Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman leading the group exclaimed in surprise at seeing the Patriarch standing there. She thought she would be meeting an Elder of the Raizel clan today, not the Patriarch himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Morning! I was up early, so I decided to drop off the boy myself. Is everyone here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Patriarch smiled at the woman and roamed his gaze to the three youngsters trailing behind the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a mission where the Elders would be giving full control of the mission over to the youths, where they would make their own decision on how to approach the objective, assign the hierarchy within their ranks, etc. This was to let them be independent and learn from their mistakes in future.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Looks like it’ll be just the four of us.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Calron noticed only three young people in the group around his age, two girls and one other guy. The young man had spiky red hair and a smooth-cut face. His dark eyes appeared to be in a constant state of seriousness as if he was observing each and every action of the people around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, one of the girls was shyly following behind the other girl. The shy girl had short auburn hair which greatly resembled Linda’s, but their personalities were the complete opposite. The short-haired girl gave off the presence of someone who felt uncomfortable around others and was easy to bully. Whereas, the girl in front had long dark hair and a calm aura exuding from her. Her green eyes bore into Calron, gauging him and his strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s dangerous.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Calron knew instinctively that the dark-haired girl was no stranger to battle and was used to mercilessly killing her enemies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Calron returned her gaze, a slight smile escaping from the corner of his mouth. The girl frowned after seeing the look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I see. Then this must be Calron, the one that we’ve been hearing about a lot recently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman faced Calron, inspecting him and his aura. She seemed satisfied and gave an approving nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Bren Talok, Sela Xin and Helly Laxerus. You four will be working together for this mission, so get to know each other before you depart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman introduced the youngsters to Calron, starting with the red-haired youth, the dangerous-looking girl and finally the shy one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laxerus? She’s related to Mirane and Erten?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Calron reflexively looked at the short-haired girl upon the mention of her name, causing Helly to instantly step behind Sela while looking apprehensively at Calron. This only deepened the frown on Sela’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here is the map targeting the storage and granary locations, but this only an estimate coordinate as you will have find the exact location once you reach that area. It’s a simple mission to exterminate all the targets on the map and return back. That’s all the instruction you’ll get, so good luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman stated, signaling to the other Elders that came with the youths and in the next moment, they all disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good luck, brat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Patriarch gave Calron a big thumbs-up before leaving as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect the Raizel clan’s Patriarch to be like that… I thought he’d be scarier and have an overbearing personality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bren commented once the Elders all left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, he can be that too when he’s fighting. Anyways, I’m Calron.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calron held out his hand to the red-haired boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just because we’re on the same mission doesn’t mean we have to be friendly with each other. Simply do your part in the objective and we can get this done with quickly in a few days. Sela and Helly, would you two object if I take charge and the position of leader?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bren ignored Calron’s greeting and instead turned to the dark-haired girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t mind. We should hurry up, Helly and I have an Academy exam coming up this week so we need to prepare for that as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sela answered nonchalantly while Helly nodded her head in acceptance. She still remained nervous at Calron’s presence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are they all ignoring me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Calron thought with irritation, seeing Bren making his plans and dictating where they should go first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo! Why don’t I get a say in this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Calron asked calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For starters, you don’t look too smart and secondly, why should we follow you? We are all students of the Academy and have been trained in warfare and strategy, unlike a village bumpkin like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bren snorted, returning back to talking with Sela and analyzing the map in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think he wants to fight, Bren.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sela grinned, sensing the change in Calron’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, I’ll entertain you. I’ve been itching to see what all this fuss was about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sela cracked her knuckles and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Uncle Kail, I don’t think I’m cut out for politics… </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Calron closed his eyes as bolts of lightning flashed around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>………………………….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are the preparations complete?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resir inquired the man kneeling in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Lord. After hearing that the boy was leaving on a mission with the other towers’ kids, we decided to start preparing for your orders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man replied in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, you may leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s a pity, but you’ll never make it to the speech for the slaves, Calron.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Resir looked outside the window, his sight set on the palace.</span></p>
