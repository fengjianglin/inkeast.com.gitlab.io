 <p><strong>Chapter 228: Mirror of Damnation, A Battle of Life and Death</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“What a blood-curdling aura.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But regardless of what kind of skill it is, I can only use Warlock Variation to deal with it because I don’t have many arcane particles left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he observed Rinsyi’s strange state, Ayrin, who never felt fear, suddenly felt extreme danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Skunk Devil Summoning!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Warlock Variation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, Ayrin immediately invoked two skills in sharp succession. Another skunk devil fell from the sky as a colorful ring of light blossomed from Ayrin’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how much does Ayrin like this Skunk Devil Summoning skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi is in such a terrifying state, yet he still used this comical skill. He has completely destroyed the tense atmosphere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many girls who had been scared to the verge of crying by Rinsyi’s suddenly transformation suddenly felt the urge to smile again as they saw Ayrin use Skunk Devil Summoning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think that you can use this laughable technique to defeat me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An intense air of resentment seemed to hang around Rinsyi as he spoke in a scathing tone. The tone of his voice was so jarring that it caused another wave of discomfort to sweep through those who heard it, as if it contained a curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This laughable method defeated Megan. Aren’t you just ridiculing your own teammate like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, students of Holy Dawn Academy couldn’t endure any longer as they opened their mouths to mock Rinsyi, but as the scene before them unfolded, no words came out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A two-sided, oval gray mirror about as tall as Rinsyi suddenly appeared atop the stage right between Ayrin and Rinsyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong aura of death rippled from the mirror’s surfaces. The side facing Rinsyi seemed to be normal as Rinsyi’s current hideous appearance emerged atop the glass, but the side facing Ayrin was not, as an abnormal and seemingly infinite arcane energy surged out from the surface and a strange domain power undulated outward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of domain is this? Such strong spiritual fluctuations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of Jean Camus, who had started carefully observing Rinsyi, slightly wavered as he abruptly felt like he himself might not be able to defend against the power of this domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’ve been sucked in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is an imprisonment skill?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The colorfully glowing Ayrin and the skunk devil which had just fallen from the sky both seemed to be affected by some strange force as they were sucked into the oval mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the spectators became flabbergasted as a still image of the glowing Ayrin and skunk devil appeared on the glass surface of the oval mirror enveloped in the gray gases of resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although frozen, the blank appearance of the skunk devil and the fighting intent on Ayrin’s face were remarkably lifelike and vivid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What skill is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the midst of Holy Dawn Academy’s team, even the calm Rinloran couldn’t help but cry out in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With such domain type skills, a single moment was enough to determine the difference between life and death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Carter’s face had paled as he replied, “It’s a kind of spiritual domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Ayrin’s life in danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’s expression was still calm, but her words were full of anxiousness. “Teacher Carter, should we immediately stop the match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just which of House Baratheon’s secret skills is this? It’s based on Body of Vengeance…” At this moment, thoughts of stopping the match also emerged in Clancy’s mind as he subconsciously began moving towards the mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you wish to stop the match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy had only just started moving when Rinsyi’s harsh voice rang out once more, causing him to abruptly freeze where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s useless. Even if you stop it now, he will still die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill ran through everyone’s body as Rinsyi’s insidious words rang through the arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin’s life is already in danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does he mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire arena descended into chaos as countless cries of shock erupted from the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Charlotte, who had long since stood up from her seat, felt her mind go blank as her body began to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you kill me now, the spiritual power of my Mirror of Damnation will not disappear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi slightly tilted his body as he looked at Clancy. A cruel smile appeared on his gray gas covered face as he continued, “You can’t forcefully break it either. Any power capable of shattering the Mirror of Damnation will also tear Ayrin to pieces. Even I, the caster, have no way of ending the power of this domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not lying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, two voices simultaneously entered Clancy’s ear, “Don’t act rashly. This is a spiritual enchantment type domain. A great amount of Rinsyi’s spiritual strength and some of Ayrin’s spiritual strength should have merged together to form it. It has become a battle of spirits… but in the Body of Vengeance state, Rinsyi won’t die if his spirit is heavily wounded while Ayrin will. Of those present, I don’t believe there is a single person who can solve this domain. We cannot help Ayrin, he will have to rely on himself this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liszt… Rowan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy didn’t even bother looking into the stands as he immediately realized who was speaking to him from their voices. It was the fighting genius of the Office of Special Affairs, Liszt, and the strongest arcane master of the Southern Devil Corps, Rowan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy understood that if Liszt and Rowan, who was a spirit control type grandmaster, were both saying the same things, then Rinysi’s words had to be true and that there was no one present to save the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the unbiased Clancy couldn’t help but feel angry towards Rinsyi as an uncontrollable rage surged through his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi was blatantly trying to kill Ayrin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ayrin seemed fine on the mirror’s surface, Clancy knew that Ayrin was most likely facing an indescribable suffering and torment within the illusory spiritual realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he was stuck in a world created by Rinsyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps the suffering and torment he faced was even hundreds of times worse than in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would Ayrin be able to fight his way out of this spiritual world which Rinsyi had created?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy felt his hands and feet become cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have much confidence in Ayrin because he knew that he himself wouldn’t necessarily be able to survive through an attack like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you I would kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi took a deep breath of air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t need to breathe while in the state of Body of Vengeance, he did so anyway. He felt as if the air around him had suddenly become filled with an extraordinary sweetness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From his point of view, Ayrin was as good as dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or rather, he was in the process of being killed, and everyone was powerless to save him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ayrin observed his surroundings, he only saw the gray void of space around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to stretch endlessly in all directions and was completely devoid of everything except for an unpleasant gray aura which permeated through the entire space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ayrin couldn’t sense the existence any arcane particles within his body, and his body felt strangely weightless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he had been turned into a floating mass of air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of arcane skill was I struck by?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is everything like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has Rinsyi hidden himself somewhere within this space?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, all kinds of thoughts and notions successively floated through Ayrin’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He waited, but Rinsyi didn’t appear, and his surroundings remained the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have I been trapped in here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin couldn’t endure any longer as he began moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly realized that this world was not normal at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because this gray void of space seemed to be endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin continued moving in the same direction for a long time, yet there wasn’t a single change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t escape?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way. Either way, even if I can’t escape, there are many people out there like the referees and Teacher Carter who will intervene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ayrin came to this conclusion, other thoughts began to run through his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi, you idiotic coward, do you dare come out and fight with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin screamed into the void. As it echoed through the empty space, the space only seemed to become even more empty and endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time slowly ticked forward as seconds became minutes, and minutes became hours. It was enough to cause one to go mad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, a day seemed to have gone by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A second day followed the first… then three… and four…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that I have already died?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Or has my spirit been eternally trapped in his domain, never to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After countless days passed without any signs of intervention, such a thought finally popped into Ayrin’s mind. But those thoughts were quickly quashed as Ayrin successively roared into the nothingness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, how can one die so easily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi, you bastard, I don’t believe you will be able to maintain this world forever!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I was still in the mines, something like this happened, and I thought I would never make it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those mines were even darker than this, yet I was still able to escape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi, I will definitely defeat you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, only a short couple of seconds had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the Mirror of Damnation’s world, one cannot sense the flow of time. Have you already gone mad and killed yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Rinsyi was also connected with the mirror, he was unable to move. Gray gases undulated from his body as he quietly muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He watched with cruel eyes as the oval gray mirror slowly dimmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the pane of glass facing him, his image gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The skunk devil has already turned gray! It’s almost indistinguishable now, as if it has merged with the mirror!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a shrill cry broke the immense tension within the arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin’s yet to change color. What does that mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Ayrin in danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As these cries entered Rinysi’s ears, the look of happiness in his cruel eyes quickly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin hasn’t changed?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, Rinsyi couldn’t help but shrilly cry out, “How! How can he still be alive?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The color atop Ayrin’s body was becoming increasingly full of vitality once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the gray mirror began to release an increasingly great amount of gray gases as it slowly began fading and melting back into nothingness.</span></p>
