 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Rinloran landed. Pushing over the limit had caused him to fall in a semi-coma state. However, the familiar stench allowed him to understand what domain Ayrin used.</p>
 <p>“Bastard...... Just how much do you love this domain......” He cursed in his mind.</p>
 <p>However, after cursing, he yelled in his mind before completely fainting, “Ayrin, you bastard, you must win!”</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>“What is this domain?”</p>
 <p>Even the white-robed priestess and black-haired arcane master who were in a fierce duel were dumbfounded for a moment.</p>
 <p>The stench made them feel the urge to vomit.</p>
 <p>“So smelly!”</p>
 <p>Many Divine Temple arcane masters desperately pinched their noses and retched.</p>
 <p>“Lord Ross......” Some Divine Temple arcane masters were shocked.</p>
 <p>The complaining Divine Temple arcane masters also stopped.</p>
 <p>The bubbly domain was wrapping around the torso of Ross who was still in Evil Dragon form.</p>
 <p><em>We are already vomiting from this stench so far away, what about Lord Ross who is directly inside of it?</em></p>
 <p>Ayrin also desperately pinched his nose. He was looking at Ross with excitement and caution.</p>
 <p>“Ah......”</p>
 <p>A mad roar came from the Death by Puking Domain.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The entire domain collapsed.</p>
 <p>The collapsed arcane power became streaks of yellowish black air currents.</p>
 <p>“Wah......”</p>
 <p>The majority of the Divine Temple arcane masters vomited non-stop until their faces turned yellow.</p>
 <p>“......” Charlotte was relieved.</p>
 <p>If not for Ayrin’s peculiar preference for the Skunk Devil Summoning and that domain which allowed them to gain multiple experiences from enduring it, they would also be puking non-stop like those Divine Temple arcane masters, unable to use arcane skills.</p>
 <p>“Is he unaffected?”</p>
 <p>“Is the Evil Dragon form more resistant against it?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin opened his eyes wide in shock.</p>
 <p>The Evil Dragon remained unmoving and looked very stable.</p>
 <p>However, in the next instant, a deafening vomit sound came from Ross’s mouth, “Wah......”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes nearly popped out.</p>
 <p>The Evil Dragon was vomiting like a waterfall, as if he were throwing up his organs.</p>
 <p>“Haha!”</p>
 <p>Ayrin was extremely happy. His body emitted a silver glow again.</p>
 <p>“While you’re vomiting, I’ll take your life!”</p>
 <p>“Come! Holy Gate of Life!”</p>
 <p>As he shouted with fighting spirit and chanted, he began dashing towards Ross with a never reached before speed!</p>
 <p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>
 <p>Glitters flashed in Ayrin’s eyes like meteor showers, getting brighter and brighter. He could sense his physical strength constantly improving. His charging speed was getting faster and faster.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The moment Ross forcefully stopped vomiting and emitted a terrifying arcane energy fluctuation, Ayrin’s arcane particles swarmed out.</p>
 <p>Ayrin’s arcane particles did not flow through the passages within his body but swarmed out from every part of his body.</p>
 <p>His body surface gained a magenta patterned hue. His entire body was releasing dazzling magenta light, as if he had become a huge cluster of arcane particles. At the same time, his body felt as if it were bursting open.</p>
 <p>“This is Holy Dawn Academy’s strongest forbidden skill, the Holy Gate of Life? But he has been fighting for such a long time, how can his body still contain such an amount of arcane particles? Are the legends true? Does the Epic Silver Dragon bloodline really have unlimited arcane particles?”</p>
 <p>“What is he doing? Suicide? Spewing out arcane particles like that is definitely suicidal!”</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters were traumatized. They felt that battling against Ayrin would not only damage them physically, their minds would also be tormented!</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>The moment Ayrin seemed to be on the verge of disintegrating, terrifying black flames rose up from around him.</p>
 <p>A huge black eyeball took form with Ayrin in the pupil.</p>
 <p><em>It’s another dark sacrifice from a near fatal condition!</em></p>
 <p>Everyone finally realized what happened.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The huge black eyeball slammed into Ross.</p>
 <p>Ross roared while his body lost balance. He was forcefully pushed back. His claws dug deep into the ground to regain his balance.</p>
 <p>The black eyeball struck his neck, his scales shattering.</p>
 <p>Within the scattering black flames and air currents, a crimson gold flash lit up.</p>
 <p>Pssh!</p>
 <p>Ayrin tightly held the crimson gold longsword with both hands and stabbed through the broken scales until only the handle could be seen.</p>
 <p>It was an unimaginably epic scene.</p>
 <p>The scattering black flames and air currents looked like a huge black rose.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ayrin, who was relatively tiny compared to Ross, fiercely stabbed a sword into Ross’s neck.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gaze froze at that moment.</p>
 <p>Especially Meraly’s group, their mouths twitching while enduring their laughter.</p>
 <p>That was because there was an even funnier scene.</p>
 <p>The tattered Stingham, who came out of nowhere, held his Green Dragon Spear and proudly stabbed into the Evil Dragon’s butt.</p>
 <p>Shanna and the other Chinyu arcane masters felt their eyes moistening.</p>
 <p><em>As expected of the Green Dragon Prince, he’s a true brave warrior...... He still dares to charge forward against such a powerful enemy...... But you stabbed so far off the mark despite charging so close? Why can’t you stab at a more vital part?</em></p>
 <p>“Ah!” Ayrin roared and exerted all his strength to slice his crimson gold longsword horizontally. He cut open a deep wound on the Evil Dragon’s neck. Blood spurted out like a fountain.</p>
 <p>“Gah......”</p>
 <p>Ross let out a sky shaking roar. He shot out countless pale white particles, blasting Ayrin and Stingham away.</p>
 <p>Bam! Bam!</p>
 <p>Ayrin and Stingham crashed into the ground.</p>
 <p>Thump!</p>
 <p>Ross shook and collapsed down like a hill.</p>
 <p>“Not good...... I can’t get up this time......”</p>
 <p>Stingham was spasming and screaming in pain. The Green Dragon Spear pressed on top of his body and released a pale green glow.</p>
 <p>“Is that guy immortal?”</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters took a step back in shock.</p>
 <p>It was because Ayrin jumped up excitedly again.</p>
 <p>“My Death by Puking Domain is really useful...... It can even suppress a six-gate arcane master like him!”</p>
 <p>“Can he still fight? He should be pretty much done for, right?”</p>
 <p>The wound on Ross’s neck was terrible.</p>
 <p>Shattered dragon scales stabbed into a large piece of rotten flesh. The black flames from dark sacrifice still burned in the wound.</p>
 <p>There was a terrible sword cut which almost cut through half of the neck within the rotten wound.</p>
 <p>However, Ayrin felt a little regretful. The surging medicinal effects in his body had completely receded after that strike.</p>
 <p>He definitely would not be able to use dark sacrifice in the battles that followed.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a trail of yellowish stench drifted past him.</p>
 <p>“Wah......”</p>
 <p>The energetic Ayrin immediately started vomiting.</p>
 <p>While vomiting, he complained, “So smelly, I’m puking as well......”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>The group became speechless again. They wanted to laugh but could not.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>A cluster of arcane energy which had a platinum core and purplish black shell blasted apart on Ross’s Evil Dragon body.</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>Meraly and Charlotte turned around in surprise.</p>
 <p>The White Dwarven Artifact Cannon vibrated and shifted back in recoil.</p>
 <p>“We didn’t shoot it! What’s going on?” Meraly shouted in reflex.</p>
 <p>“Merlin?”</p>
 <p>Right after she shouted, Meraly and Charlotte noticed it was Merlin.</p>
 <p>There was a purplish black crystal inserted to a socket at the base of the cannon. The purplish black smoke wrapped around the entire cannon like blood vessels.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that the crystal that was attached to Ross’s tongue?”</p>
 <p>Meraly and Charlotte realized what happened. “Great King!” they exclaimed together.</p>
 <p>“The metal clockwork war avatar actually activated that cannon by itself! It even modified the cannon?”</p>
 <p>“What kind of monsters are these people?”</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters trembled.</p>
 <p>“He’s not dead yet!”</p>
 <p>“He should still be able to fight! Otherwise, Merlin won’t keep attacking him!”</p>
 <p>Ayrin raised his guard.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Another purplish black aracne energy cluster blasted onto Ross.</p>
 <p>“Gah......”</p>
 <p>Ross let out another pained roar.</p>
 <p>His body emitted black light. A huge black cloud appeared above his head.</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
 <p>Various arcane powers exploded around the four Evil Dragon bones in the Doa Royal Palace.</p>
 <p>Over a dozen royal arcane masters kept shooting arcane skills, but they were unable to stop the advancement of the huge earthworm-like monster.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, the monster suddenly trembled and dove into the ground.</p>
 <p>Kaboom......</p>
 <p>The ground collapsed in a trail towards the Green Dragon Divine Temple.</p>
 <p>“It’s gone? It went towards the Green Dragon Divine Temple. What’s happening over there?” The sweating royal arcane masters looked towards the Green Dragon Divine Temple in shock.</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>Within the Green Dragon Divine Temple.</p>
 <p>Ayrin and the other could also feel the great tremor underground. They could clearly sense a huge object digging towards them.</p>
 <p>“It’s that worm!”</p>
 <p>“Stinky egg, I told you to call that worm long ago and you refused. So you’re finally willing to call it over!”</p>
 <p>Ayrin became excited. His eyes sparkled as he waited in anticipation.</p>
