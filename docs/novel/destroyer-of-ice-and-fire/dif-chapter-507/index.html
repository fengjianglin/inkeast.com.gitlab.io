 <p><strong>Chapter 503: Great Drunken Warrior</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Following the unique fragrance, Ayrin soon discovered a vertical passage leading up. After going through the passage which seemed to be used for dumping, he found himself in a huge wine cellar.</p>
 <p>The wine cellar was so big he almost could not see the other end. Wine barrels of human height were placed on the large shelves around him.</p>
 <p>“This is the fragrance from the wine in the wine barrels.” Ayrin realized.</p>
 <p>“It’s so fragrant, it must taste great!”</p>
 <p>Ayrin could not endure any longer. He unplugged the wine barrel in front of him.</p>
 <p>Purplish red wine flowed out. He took a sip to test it.</p>
 <p>“Delicious!”</p>
 <p>His eyes immediately sparkled. He let out a joyful cry, “It’s sweet! Charlotte, do you want to try?”</p>
 <p>“Sure.” Charlotte also took a sip. She found it refreshingly sweet. There was the fragrance of fruit, it should be some type of fruit wine.</p>
 <p>However, after taking a few sips, she immediately felt heat rising up from her stomach.</p>
 <p>Seeing Ayrin gulping down the wine, she reminded him with worry, “It’s delicious, but don’t get drunk, Ayrin.”</p>
 <p>Ayrin continued gulping down the wine while muffling, “It’s fine...... I will just stop if I feel I’m getting drunk......”</p>
 <p>He was way too hungry.</p>
 <p>Although it was not as satisfying as a barbeque, it was better than nothing.</p>
 <p>Soon, Charlotte called out again in worry, “Ayrin, are you really not drunk?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin was drinking way too fast. He finished a few barrels in a moment.</p>
 <p>“No...... I’m quite sober......” Ayrin answered.</p>
 <p>He was getting better at drinking. He straightened his throat and let the wine directly pour into his stomach.</p>
 <p>“Is it really alright? Why does your body feel so heated?”</p>
 <p>Charlotte could not help but worry.</p>
 <p>Ayrin’s body was clearly rising in temperature, as if he was a steamer.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine...... It feels like a hot bath, very comfortable.”</p>
 <p>Ayrin did not feel drunk at all. He only felt his blood circulating faster than before. Each cell in his body seemed to be drinking.</p>
 <p>“Are you really fine?”</p>
 <p>Charlotte could not feel relieved.</p>
 <p>The dozens of barrels on the shelf were all finished by Ayrin. Ayrin’s body was clearly red from the heat it was giving off. The water in his body seemed to be evaporating, creating a white pillar of steam rising up to the ceiling of the wine cellar and falling down as water droplets after condensing. In addition, Ayrin’s stomach did not bloat up even after drinking so much wine.</p>
 <p>Ayrin turned to look at Charlotte and answered with confidence, “I’m really fine. See, I’m sober.”</p>
 <p>Seeing him turn around, Helgy immediately went closer and said, “Daddy......”</p>
 <p>“Ugh......”</p>
 <p>However, the moment she got close, her face turned red and her eyes spun. She spun two circles on the spot and fell down.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with this Evil Dragon follower now?” Ayrin felt strange.</p>
 <p>“What a dense alcoholic smell......”</p>
 <p>While Charlotte was also confused, a dense alcoholic smell entered her nose and stimulated her brain. She also felt dizzy.</p>
 <p>“Ayrin, you might be fine, but the alcoholic smell you give off when you speak is too strong.” She immediately reacted and pinched her nose while taking a few steps back.</p>
 <p>“You were affected? Why can’t I smell it?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin opened his eyes wide and mumbled while looking at the fallen Helgy.</p>
 <p>“Dad...... Gup......”</p>
 <p>Helgy was regaining her senses. She just raised her head while Ayrin was mumbling in her direction. She fainted again.</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>Ayrin became speechless. He stopped talking and continued pouring wine down his throat.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be a bottomless hole. The wine barrels were emptied by him at a frightening speed. The more he drank, the more proficient he became. He even used an inhaling technique to increase the speed at which the wine flowed down his throat. However, his stomach never bloated no matter how much he drank.</p>
 <p>The water vapor in the entire wine cellar became extremely dense. It even started raining.</p>
 <p>“This is all?” Ayrin suddenly grumbled.</p>
 <p>He saw the last two shelves before him.</p>
 <p>Charlotte was unsure whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p><em>The wine in this wine cellar has been accumulated by the Kingdom of Doa for who knows how many years. But you’re about to drink it all in one sitting!</em></p>
 <p>“Strange!”</p>
 <p>Ayrin suddenly trembled as he continued his drinking spree.</p>
 <p>He could feel the heat in his body disappearing. A unique aura was reverberating in his body.</p>
 <p>“Is my bloodline talent domain going to come out?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin opened his eyes wide, but then felt something amiss.</p>
 <p>That feeling was similar to when he just finished the entire Ice Dragon Spirit.</p>
 <p>It was not the arcane power law naturally generated by his bloodline. Instead, it seemed to be an aura generated when the cells in his body had absorbed a sufficient amount of a specific element.</p>
 <p>“What’s this? Is it going to become a domain as well?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin turned around to look at the empty wine barrels, “Can I gain a domain from just drinking?”</p>
 <p>Charlotte also sensed the change in Ayrin and asked, “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Weird, I sense a new domain just like when I ate the Ice Dragon Spirit.” Ayrin scratched his head and spoke with some ambiguity, “I should be able to use it after feeling a bit more of it, just like with the Eternal Winter Domain. But it doesn’t seem to be my own bloodline’s talent domain.”</p>
 <p>“What? A new domain?” Charlotte’s eyes opened wide.</p>
 <p>After getting ahold of herself, she quickly added, “Try sensing it clearly.”</p>
 <p>Domain power had the unique repelling property. Hence, a domain could cause great changes to an arcane master’s strength. In Charlotte’s perspective, nothing was more important than letting Ayrin clearly sense the domain.</p>
 <p>“Sure.”</p>
 <p>Ayrin was obedient and immediately began sensing the unique aura of that domain in earnest.</p>
 <p>“It should be about there.”</p>
 <p>After a dozen minutes, Ayrin nodded confidently.</p>
 <p>“The domain aura should not spread out in this sealed area...... Even if others discover it, we will have run away by then. Let me try what domain it is.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, after you try it, we will immediately leave this place.” Charlotte agreed. It was very important to understand what domain it was before facing the enemy.</p>
 <p>“Here goes!” Ayrin exclaimed with expectation.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>The arcane power tide unique to domains immediately filled the surrounding air.</p>
 <p><em>It really is a domain power!</em></p>
 <p>Ayrin and Charlotte kept their eyes wide open.</p>
 <p>“Such a small area?” they almost screamed in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Domains usually covered a large area, at least over dozens of meters. However, the domain Ayrin activated was only a unique arcane power field of about five or so meters.</p>
 <p>A pink glow constantly spread out. While the two were surprised, the pink glow became an oval ball of light that looked like a cloud.</p>
 <p>“It has an alcoholic fragrance?”</p>
 <p>“Why does it seem rather harmless?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin looked at that ball of light in disappointment. He did not feel any destructive aura. If the domain was that small, it was no different from a pinpoint arcane skill. It would be difficult to lock onto powerful opponents with it.</p>
 <p>“Daddy......”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a familiar voice could be heard.</p>
 <p>Helgy, who fainted from getting drunk, had woken up at some point. She was currently standing next to that ball of light and stretched out a hand to touch it.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>The instant she touched it, it suddenly expanded into vapor and swarmed into her body.</p>
 <p>Ayrin and Charlotte flinched.</p>
 <p>“Daddy......” Helgy called out again.</p>
 <p>Her face immediately blushed.</p>
 <p>Her eyes were spinning as if she got drunk.</p>
 <p>“Hic...... Hah!”</p>
 <p>However, Ayrin and Charlotte were shocked when Helgy suddenly shouted fiercely. It sounded like the shouts of arcane masters during training.</p>
 <p>She jumped around while punching and kicking non-stop.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, a layer of a rose-colored glow shone from the surface of her body.</p>
 <p>“Daddy...... Beat...... bad guys...... Hic...... Hah......”</p>
 <p>Helgy jumped around Ayrin and Charlotte. She even showed an expression full of fighting spirit just like what Ayrin showed when he was fighting.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>He unconsciously stretched out his hand to touch the rose-colored glow surrounding Helgy to find out what it was.</p>
 <p><em>Domain?</em></p>
 <p>However, before he actually touched the glow, his finger could already feel strong resistance and obstruction. An aura unique to domain shocked his body through his finger.</p>
 <p>Sss......</p>
 <p>Ayrin drew a sharp breath.</p>
 <p>His finger touched the edge of the rose-colored glow. The instant he touched it, his mental strength felt like it was burning. He felt as if he was drunk and became dizzy.</p>
 <p>Charlotte also noticed the change in Ayrin.</p>
 <p>“Hic...... Hah!” Helgy was still jumping around with a drunken expression yet filled with endless fighting spirit, just like a battle maniac.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that this domain makes whoever is shrouded inside become a drunken battle maniac? In addition, there is an arcane power layer covering the body to make whoever comes into contact with it drunk?”</p>
 <p>Ayrin and Charlotte looked at each other.</p>
 <p>“Her physical strength also seems greater than before.”</p>
 <p>Ayrin studied Helgy for a while and exclaimed, “And this arcane power layer seems to be similar to the anti-arcane armor created by Reattachment. It has a strong defensive power.”</p>
 <p>Although Helgy was randomly swinging her fists and legs like a kitten, Ayrin could see power brands behind each of her punches becoming like layers of crystals in the air.</p>
 <p><em>How long can this domain sustain?</em></p>
 <p><em>If there’s an enemy, will she help us fight?</em></p>
 <p>Ayrin and Charlotte stared at each other with dumbfounded expressions.</p>
 <p>Even Merlin, who was right behind them, seemed to be confused as her eyes sparkled.</p>
