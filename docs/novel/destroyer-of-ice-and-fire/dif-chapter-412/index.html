 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p><strong>Chapter 409: It Did Wonders</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This is the Banshee Queen Forest in House Roland’s territory? Isn’t it too beautiful?”</p>
 <p>“It’s beautiful to the point of bewitching......”</p>
 <p>Looking at the ancient forest before them, Ayrin and the rest were mesmerized.</p>
 <p>That place was House Roland’s central territory, called the Banshee Queen Forest.</p>
 <p>It was completely different from House Eclipse Moon’s territory despite it being a primeval demonic forest with the same climate.</p>
 <p>Even those gigantic trees over a hundred meters tall and the thick vines entwined on those trunks were mostly flowering species, with various kinds of flowering blooming on them.</p>
 <p>The forest was just like the garden of the legendary Banshee Queen. All kinds of flowers could be seen in a glance.</p>
 <p>Some trees had flowers the size of half a room, the pollen that fell looked like pieces of bread. However, some trees had tiny flowers. Tiny flowers dotted the entire tree, like snowflakes decorating the tree.</p>
 <p>On the trunks, different flowers bloomed on symbiotic vines. On the ground, countless different flowers bloomed through cracks in stones.</p>
 <p>The scene was overly colorful and beautiful, hence it looked bewitching.</p>
 <p>“Is this place really formed naturally? Or is it possible that this forest is a ruin from the past, which happened to be a huge garden?”</p>
 <p>After they were mesmerized for a while, Ayrin and Chris spoke to Stingham, “Alright, let’s advance with our dragon slaying plan part one!”</p>
 <p>“Dragon slaying plan part one again?” Stingham complained.</p>
 <p>“Don’t make a fuss. There can be enemies anytime here! If we get surrounded by a few arcane teams, we won’t be able to escape.” Rinloran glared at Stingham sharply.</p>
 <p>Stingham reluctantly circulated the arcane particles within his body. Along with waves of arcane aura emitted, Stingham’s body began to grow many flowering trees. Then, those trees bloomed countless flowers. The growth became denser and denser, eventually becoming a big patch of flowering bush hiding the entire Holy Dawn Academy team inside.</p>
 <p>After that, the patch of flowering bush began navigating through House Roland’s territory quickly.</p>
 <p>“This dragon slaying plan part one is still so effective. We can hide our figures without using any arcane skill. Also, Stingham’s presence becomes similar to these woods at the same time. It should be an arcane energy fluctuation even those detection devices cannot discover. What a great plan.” As they moved closer and closer to the marked area on the map, Ayrin became more and more excited.</p>
 <p>“This is dragon slaying plan part one. Then what is dragon slaying plan part two?” Stingham grumbled.</p>
 <p>“Dragon slaying plan part two? I haven’t thought about it.” Ayrin and Chris shook their heads.</p>
 <p>“So in the end, you only have this sneaking infiltration plan. You still call that part one!” Stingham almost fumbled.</p>
 <p>“Stop!”</p>
 <p>Belo suddenly made a hand sign.</p>
 <p>They immediately stopped their chattering, stayed still, and even controlled their breathings.</p>
 <p>“Safe!”</p>
 <p>After about half a minute, Belo made another hand sign and led the way again.</p>
 <p>In a spot not far away, four arcane masters stopped for a while in a colorful bush, then continued their patrol.</p>
 <p>The four arcane masters wore snow white tight leather armor and carried materialized weapons like swords on their backs. They were all riding on mounts many times bigger than themselves.</p>
 <p>Two of those mounts were pure black demonic leopards. Their entire body of fur seemed to be oozing black oil, even their teeth were pure black.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the mounts of the other two arcane masters were fiery mounting flowers which were very rare.</p>
 <p>It was a strange red plant with extraordinary moving speed. It could also gather decent fire type arcane energy. In the Kingdom of Eiche, Three-Headed Dragon Academy was breeding such fiery mounting flowers. The Three-Headed Dragon Academy had a special fiery flower festival, which was to let students compete in taming fiery mounting flowers and riding them to participate in some fighting competitions.</p>
 <p>However, the fiery mounting flowers Three-Headed Dragon Academy bred was only the size of two adult men. The fiery mounting flowers those two arcane masters rode were at least twice the size of Three-Headed Dragon Academy’s instead.</p>
 <p>“The fiery mounting flower seemed to react just now...... It felt that this zone has a vibration similar to arcane master’s footsteps......”</p>
 <p>“It might be some beast’s footstep coincidentally reaching the human footstep’s frequency. Otherwise, the fiery mounting flower would not stop sensing it...... and the black demonic leopard also didn’t smell anything......”</p>
 <p>“Hmm, it’s impossible for any arcane team to infiltrate into here anyway. They would have been discovered by lord Lewis before that......”</p>
 <p>The conversation between the four arcane masters could be vaguely heard.</p>
 <p>They did not believe that any enemy could infiltrate into their zone. Hence, although they still patrolled carefully, they were not concerned with their conversation.</p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p>“This is the nest of the ex-House Roland’s guardian dragon, the Crimson Gold Poisonous Dragon? Belo, you have only looked at the map once in Eclipse Moon’s camp before setting off until now. Is it possible that you took us to the wrong place?”</p>
 <p>Stingham watched the front with a big bush of flowers on his head as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Idiot!” The rest of the Holy Dawn Academy team rebuked at the same time.</p>
 <p>Before them was a mountain.</p>
 <p>That mountain was a sculpture!</p>
 <p>The entire mountain was carved into an enormous sculpture.</p>
 <p>That sculpture was an integration of House Roland’s ancestor and a dragon. The body was humanoid in shape and wielded two swords. However, dragon scales covered the entire body, and a pair of dragon wings sprouted at the back.</p>
 <p>There was an obvious huge cave between the feet of the sculpture.</p>
 <p>The entrance of the cave showed clear signs of corrosion. The ground was corroded into a layer of sand. The sandy ground also showed signs of clawing, with a few clear huge claw prints of dragon.</p>
 <p>However, Stingham actually asked if it was really the nest of the Crimson Gold Poisonous Dragon.</p>
 <p>“Is it really the one? Why don’t we go back instead?” Stingham was used to others scolding him idiot. He did not mind at all and suggested that instead.</p>
 <p>“Shut up! Or we will throw you in alone first!” Rinloran lost the motivation to continue scolding Stingham, he just made a chilling warning.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. The Eclipse Moon chief shaman clearly told us that the dragon has become too weak, so House Roland took great efforts to keep that Emperor Evil Eye, making it into their new guardian beast.” Ayrin tapped on Stingham’s shoulder to encourage him, “Also, didn’t chief shaman give you a bottle of good stuff with wonderful effect? I have also learned Red Alkalic Volcano, so there won’t be much danger.”</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah! Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Stingham immediately became motivated.</p>
 <p>A big patch of suspicious flower bush sneaked into the cave between the feet of the sculpture.</p>
 <p>The interior of the cave was strangely dry. The ground was soft fiery-colored sand.</p>
 <p>“That old shaman told me to drink it once we are inside. Then I will drink it now. Too bad there’s only one bottle.” Stingham immediately took out the small blue crystal bottle. He licked the content and felt that it was a little cold and sweet. Then he gulped it down in one go.</p>
 <p>A wave of chilling sensation instantly filled his body.</p>
 <p>Then, a layer of bluish glow covered him. Other than that, Stingham did not feel any discomfort.</p>
 <p>“What a unique arcane power! It seems to be an anti-arcane layer formed by some sort of arcane energy.”</p>
 <p>Ayrin opened his eyes wide in surprise. He stretched out his finger to touch the glow outside Stingham’s body. His finger immediately felt a shocking elasticity, and the fingertip also felt a little numb.</p>
 <p>“Incredible! Haha, it’s good stuff as expected. I feel like gaining a layer of powerful anti-arcane skin!” Stingham could also feel it himself. He became greatly elated and a sense of security filled him.</p>
 <p>Belo still walked in front of everyone.</p>
 <p>The dragon nest seemed to be very deep. They had already advanced at least several hundred meters through the curves and turns, but they still seemed far away from the actual living quarter of the dragon. That was because they could feel gusts of wind blowing towards them from far away, as if there was an even bigger space inside.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Belo came to a halt again.</p>
 <p>“Weird!”</p>
 <p>He suddenly turned around and looked at Stingham’s feet. His impulsive expression showed confusion.</p>
 <p>“What’s weird?” Stingham saw Belo’s expression and could not help but looked at his own feet.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he lost his balance.</p>
 <p>The sand beneath his feet became a huge sand wave sprouting upwards just like when the three sandworms manifested.</p>
 <p>“What!? Why are there so many huge lobsters!?”</p>
 <p>Stingham opened his eyes to the widest and shouted in disbelief as he was thrown upwards.</p>
 <p>Countless red ‘lobsters’ the size of two to three men wildly surged out from the sandy ground, just like volcano eruption.</p>
 <p>“Idiot! They are Poisonous Fiery Scorpions!” Rinloran had the urge to end that idiot’s life as he leapt back.</p>
 <p>“What!? Not lobsters! Ah!”</p>
 <p>Stingham immediately turned green in fear.</p>
 <p>A few huge pliers instantly clamped Stingham, his arms and legs were tightly clamped.</p>
 <p>“Let go of me! I’m here to slay the dragon!”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you scorpions? Why are you clamping me like lobsters even though you are not!?”</p>
 <p>Stingham cried out.</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>Ayrin, Chris and the rest were surprised by the scene unfolding before them.</p>
 <p>That was because all the poisonous fiery scorpions had ignored them and snatched Stingham away like snatching a bride.</p>
 <p>Countless poisonous fiery scorpions held Stingham and quickly moved further into the cave like a crimson tide.</p>
 <p>“Could it be......”</p>
 <p>Ayrin, Chris and Rinloran suddenly realized what happened, their face immediately changed into a sly look.</p>
 <p>“I’m here to slay the dragon!”</p>
 <p>“Let go of me! I’m here to help you slay the dragon, why are you clamping me......”</p>
 <p>“I’m here to slay......”</p>
 <p>Stingham was pushed into a huge valley-like space by the swarming scorpions. There seemed to be two huge glowing gems and two wind holes.</p>
 <p>Waves of wind blew out from the wind holes.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, his shouting ceased.</p>
 <p>That was because he saw the two huge glowing gems blinked and a wave of even fiercer wind blew onto him. Then he saw the enormous body clearly...... shiny scales.</p>
 <p>“I’m here to slay...... Ah! No, it’s a misunderstanding!”</p>
 <p>The instant all those scorpions scattered away, he cried out as if he just woke up from a nightmare.</p>
