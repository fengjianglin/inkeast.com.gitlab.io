 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Green Dragon Prince?</em></p>
 <p>The arcane masters could not comprehend what Stingham said.</p>
 <p>“See this? I possess the purest Green Dragon bloodline!”</p>
 <p>Stingham swung the spear in his hand. Arcane particles flowed and grass began growing from his surroundings. Even a bush started forming.</p>
 <p>“What are you spacing out for? My Green Dragon Prince’s identity has been ascertained by Clan Chinyu! As the Divine Temple arcane masters, shouldn’t you serve me? So, do you know anything about Jean Camus? Tell me!” Stingham shouted towards the Divine Temple arcane masters with a haughty voice.</p>
 <p>The arcane masters looked at one another.</p>
 <p>“Is he using Voice Manipulation?”</p>
 <p>“Or Soul Charming?”</p>
 <p>“Do you feel anything weird?”</p>
 <p>“No......”</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about?” Stingham was dumbfounded as he heard them talk.</p>
 <p>“It’s useless. The outside world does not know the existence of the Green Dragon Prince. Normal arcane masters also don’t know the existence of a guardian clan like us.” Shanna explained to Stingham with a grim expression, “They don’t understand what you are talking about.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t understand?” Stingham felt depressed. He looked at the Divine Temple arcane masters and shouted, “We are Jean Camus’s friends. We have come to look for him. Tell us where he is! You should understand this question!”</p>
 <p>The arcane masters glanced at each other. One of them asked, “You infiltrated here to look for Jean Camus?”</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, there’s also the Passion Fruit Tree! Shanna, our Teacher Carter needs the Passion Fruit for treatment. Do you know where the Passion Fruit Tree is?” Stingham suddenly remembered something and turned around to ask Shanna with a low volume. Then, he grumbled, “Rinloran, have you forgotten about this matter?”</p>
 <p>“Idiot, must I waste my time to list out every detail!? We are going to catch a few arcane masters to interrogate anyway. You can ask them that too!” Rinloran glared at Stingham, feeling the urge to ignore him.</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters looked at Stingham, Shanna and Rinloran discussing amongst themselves. One of them turned serious and warned, “We don’t care who you are. Infiltrating into the Green Dragon Divine Temple is a grave crime. If you are Jean Camus’s friends, I hope you can obediently surrender.”</p>
 <p>“They are trying to delay us and wait for more arcane teams to arrive. While we have the numerical advantage, let’s subdue one or two of them and kill the rest!” Shanna did not answer Stingham’s question regarding the Passion Fruit and made a suggestion instead.</p>
 <p>“Alright!”</p>
 <p>Stingham immediately nodded. He shouted, “Will you cooperate or not? If not, don’t blame us for using force!”</p>
 <p>“You idiot, do you think this is a competition? Why are you announcing that we will attack them!?”</p>
 <p>Meraly’s vision dimmed for a moment from anger.</p>
 <p>“The entire Green Dragon Divine Temple has the function to obstruct external arcane power. Arcane skills can’t even be used at some places. Although you can use arcane skills here, the power of the arcane skills are just one tenth of the usual, and domain powers cannot manifest at all. So, be careful when using arcane skills, it will be hard to adapt to the change!”</p>
 <p>“In the Green Dragon Divine Temple, the power of arcane skills is greatly reduced. One tenth of some powerful arcane skills is no different from one tenth of a normal arcane skill. Hence, the best way to fight is to combine arcane skills that do not cost a lot of arcane particles. These Divine Temple arcane masters have gone through specialized training in that area, so they are experienced in fighting here. Be careful!”</p>
 <p>Shanna hurriedly warned everyone. At the same time, arcane energy fluctuations surged out from her body. She and the six Chinyu arcane masters took the lead and dashed out.</p>
 <p>“This Green Dragon Divine Temple will reduce the power of arcane skills to one tenth of their original?”</p>
 <p>“The best fighting method is to combine arcane skills that don’t cost as much arcane particles...... using the variation of normal arcane skills to defeat the opponent...... isn’t this the fighting method Ayrin is best at?”</p>
 <p>Rinloran immediately thought of Ayrin. However, his body did not slow down and instantly caught up to Shanna.</p>
 <p>“Super Gravity Line!”</p>
 <p>The few arcane masters standing at the exit were clearly prepared to fight.</p>
 <p>They did not move back but spread out inside the hall instead.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the leading arcane master chanted a Draconic incantation and an invisible wave suddenly swept out in front of him.</p>
 <p>Rinloran and Shanna, along with the other six Chinyu arcane masters instantly felt heavy and slowed down.</p>
 <p>“Wait for me!”</p>
 <p>Stingham held the spear and rushed after them, until he was suddenly in front of them.</p>
 <p>“Death Rings!”</p>
 <p>The moment Stingham was caught by the gravity effect, dozens of materialized metal rings flew out from another arcane master and approached him from all directions.</p>
 <p>“Water Wall!”</p>
 <p>One Chinyu arcane master casted a defensive skill. A circular wall of water immediately rose up around Stingham. The metal rings kept clashing against the wall of water. However, they could not break the barrier and were unable to reach Stingham.</p>
 <p>“Bastards! I told you I’m the Green Dragon Prince! It’s fine if you don’t understand! I’m so handsome! You should be thanking me when I didn’t want to beat you up. How dare you attack me!”</p>
 <p>Although the metal rings did not hit Stingham, he was still enraged.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you supposed to be my subordinates!?”</p>
 <p>“Shouldn’t you be helping me beat people up!?”</p>
 <p>“You dare to attack me instead!”</p>
 <p>“You think your petty attacks can work against me?”</p>
 <p>With a loud boom, Stingham swung his green spear and charged out of the wall of water himself.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>The spear in his hand suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>At the same time, an astonishing green flame lit up next to the arcane master who threw the dozens of metal rings.</p>
 <p>“What!”</p>
 <p>That arcane master immediately paled. He desperately tried to dive sideways.</p>
 <p>The others were also shocked.</p>
 <p>This was a dangerous, devastating aura!</p>
 <p>The green flame did not seem to be affected by the Green Dragon Divine Temple. In fact, the arcane power within the Green Dragon Divine Temple seemed to be gathering around it and integrating into the green flame instead.</p>
 <p>The green flame gave Rinloran and Ferguillo a feeling that it was as dangerous as Chris’s Dark Destruction Dragon.</p>
 <p>The only difference was that the green flame was highly condensed, unlike the wide range of Chris’s Dark Destruction Dragon.</p>
 <p>Pssh!</p>
 <p>The ground next to that arcane master was directly vaporized. Everything that was not instantly vaporized was turned to dust by the invisible arcane power.</p>
 <p>A green spear slightly shook while stabbed into the ground.</p>
 <p><em>Is that Stingham’s spear?</em></p>
 <p>Stingham was also surprised.</p>
 <p>He just thought of stabbing that arcane master once. However, just as he exerted his strength and showed the intention to stab his spear moved by itself.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>Something even more astonishing occured next.</p>
 <p>The green spear that was firmly embedded into the ground disappeared.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Stingham felt a weight in his hand. The spear appeared back in his hand!</p>
 <p>“What arcane skill is that!?”</p>
 <p>“What materialize skill is that?”</p>
 <p>“Even if it’s a throwing type materialize skill, it shouldn’t return directly into his hand like that!”</p>
 <p>“Impossible! The returning speed is even faster than the casting speed!”</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters were frightened. Their faces paled and they were drenched in cold sweat.</p>
 <p>“This spear the Green Dragon Scepter changed into can actually release such an attack and return to him?”</p>
 <p>Rinloran and the others held their breaths.</p>
 <p>However, they knew that it was unrelated to Stingham’s arcane level and arcane skills. It was related to the weapon itself.</p>
 <p><em>So special...... and so powerful!</em></p>
 <p><em>As expected of the relic of the Land of War. The peace advocating Green Dragon left behind this weapon of war that can only be used during a real crisis!</em></p>
 <p>“It’s actually so powerful?”</p>
 <p>Stingham’s eyes sparkled. He could feel that he did not exhaust any arcane particles in that attack.</p>
 <p>“Let’s try it again?”</p>
 <p>“I poke!”</p>
 <p>He locked back onto the arcane master who threw the metal rings and aimed the spear.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>The spear disappeared from his hand again.</p>
 <p>A terrifying green flame appeared next to that arcane master again.</p>
 <p>He leapt back in fear as another piece of the ground next to him was vaporized.</p>
 <p>The green spear stabbed into the depression, then disappeared before reappearing in Stingham’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Incredible!”</p>
 <p>Stingham laughed.</p>
 <p>It was truly the best treasure amongst the ones he had robbed so far.</p>
 <p>It was like the combination of a materialize skill and a charging type skill. Plus, the power mostly came from the weapon itself.</p>
 <p>Rinloran, Meraly and the rest had also noticed it.</p>
 <p><em>But why did he keep missing?</em></p>
 <p>Stingham did not seem to be able to aim properly. Stingham might not be able to hit that arcane master even if he did not dodge.</p>
 <p>“Stingham, can’t you aim properly?” Meraly asked Stingham in whisper.</p>
 <p>“It might be a mistake......”</p>
 <p>Stingham felt a little embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Again!”</p>
 <p>“I poke!”</p>
 <p>Stingham thrusted at that arcane master again.</p>
 <p>“Ah?”</p>
 <p>This time, Stingham was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>He aimed at the arcane master who threw the metal rings, but the spear almost stabbed the arcane master next to that arcane master.</p>
 <p>“I poke!”</p>
 <p>“I stab!”</p>
 <p>“I poke again!”</p>
 <p>“I stab again!”</p>
 <p>Pieces of ground were vaporized and became full of holes. However, Stingham could not hit that arcane master no matter what he tried.</p>
 <p>“......” Stingham almost cried as he realized the problem himself.</p>
 <p>The stabbing was indeed similar to throwing a javelin. The moment the spear shot out was similar to letting go of a javelin. However, he lacked fundamental training, let alone javelin throwing training. If they were dozens of meters apart, he might not hit even if the opponent stood still.</p>
 <p>“Such power, such impact speed......”</p>
 <p>The Divine Temple arcane masters who were now thoroughly drenched in cold sweat thought differently than Stingham.</p>
 <p>They even suspected that Stingham was purposely showing mercy by not hitting them.</p>
 <p>The green flame the spear changed into was several times faster than normal arcane skills. They would not be able to dodge it with their speed in the Green Dragon Divine Temple.</p>
 <p>At the same time, they assumed that any arcane master who had done even a little bit of training would not miss by such a large margin.</p>
 <p>So, the only logical explanation was that the opponent was missing on purpose! He was showing mercy!</p>
