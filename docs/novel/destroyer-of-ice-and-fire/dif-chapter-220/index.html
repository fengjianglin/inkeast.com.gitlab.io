 <p><strong>Chapter 220: The Unpredictable Stingham and the Impetuous Belo</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Such terrifying arcane energy fluctuations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin’s eyes widened as he saw the entire area above the arena turn golden while Stingham’s body shot into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven giant doors of pure gold, each about ten meters tall, suddenly appeared in midair around Stingham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden arcane energy rippled across the top each door like a golden crown, making them look both beautiful and solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brilliant golden light radiated from each door and slowly converged atop Stingham’s body, causing Stingham’s figure to become blindingly dazzling as it grew larger and larger. It looked like the seven gold doors were giving birth to a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was actually able to break through my Eternal Nightmare … but it doesn’t matter. How could his arcane skill possibly match all of the residue energies left here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin’s expression remained blank as he raised his head and watched the grand scene occurring in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single word which only Tyrin himself could hear shot out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pew pew pew…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the glowing clusters of rock shards which had emerged from the ground simultaneously accelerated at this moment as they began shooting towards Stingham like countless meteors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually turned my handsome hair into this mess!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to smash you into a pulp!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the brilliantly shining Stingham hysterically shouted in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone furrowed their brows as they simultaneously jumped in their seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Stingham raved in midair, the seven giant golden doors began violently falling towards Tyrin in quick succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding dang dang dang…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless rock shards abruptly collided with the first giant golden door. With terrifying sounds, countless waves visible to the naked eye rippled across the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first door was directly shattered into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second and third doors followed… in but a moment, five out of the seven giant golden doors had been completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stands were completely engulfed by chaotic gusts of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tyrin’s arcane skill is actually so strong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone tried their best to keep their eyes open and watch the match. Although the arcane skill released by Stingham in his enraged state was strong, they all felt like it was impossible for him to overcome Tyrin’s energy imbued clusters of rock shards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing the power of the clusters, they believed the remaining two doors would also be completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But right at this moment, Tyrin’s body began to sway fiercely as a streak of blood oozed from a corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be?” Audrey subconsciously shouted from amongst Dragon Breath Academy’s team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stingham’s skill is extremely strange as the force generated from the collisions have all continued downwards.” Morgan helplessly sighed, “Tyrin’s domain indeed surpasses Stingham’s skill in strength when displayed here, but his body is unable to endure the repeated battering from the forces and pressure created by the collisions of their arcane energies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the center of the stage, Tyrin’s body was continuously compressed by the pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, even the small capillaries within his eyes had been squeezed to the point of exploding, causing his vision to blur and his eyes to become entirely blood red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the air around him also became compressed, he felt like he was surrounded by constricting iron plates. He couldn’t breath, or even circulate arcane particles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My body can’t endure any longer… but how can I lose to this guy… I must continue…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin strained to remain standing as he forcefully squeezed arcane particles out of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack! Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last two giant golden doors finally shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! Give me my handsome hair back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a boom, Stingham’s resplendently glowing body shot another ten meters into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a jet of blood spurt out from within Tyrin’s mouth like a geyser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the upward flying rock clusters seemed to simultaneously break down as if they had reached their limits as they began to scatter, turning into specks of different colored light and coloring the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tyrin’s done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This though ran through almost everyone’s mind at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin stood motionlessly atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But everyone could sense Tyrin’s arcane particles scattering and going out of control the moment they exited his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This only occurred when one was internally injured to a point where their body was no longer able to self-regulate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi gutturally roared from the midst of Golden Stag Academy’s team as Megan and the rest dazedly observed the scene before them, not daring to believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Stag Academy’s team members all turned their heads to look and were abruptly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s face had already become twisted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if the skin on his face had become somewhat transparent, one could see a blue glow faintly flickering within the blood vessels on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin had also been defeated… was this real?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A team from St Lauren which had to make it through the gauntlet to qualify for this tournament is actually so strong? Why are they so confident they can beat us?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emotions which had been repressed suddenly emerged within Rinysi’s mind and transformed into rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crunch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a corner of the stands, Songat finally stopped chewing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liszt, didn’t you just say that this Stingham fellow is incredibly lazy and talk about how he always tries to avoid training through various methods? So how come he knows Rui’s skill, Doors of Gods?” Songat turned his head and looked at Liszt as he continued, “If I remember correctly, this Doors of Gods is quite hard to learn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was out of my control. This fellow is just too narcissistic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liszt looked at the floating Stingham as he said with a smirk, “This fellow doesn’t learn arcane skills because they are useful, but because they can make him look more handsome. He slacks off when it comes to learning skills which are suitable for him, but for this one skill, he thought that this skill made him look very handsome, so he made quite a bit of effort and spent a lot of time on learning it. In the end, even though this taboo skill is incredibly hard to learn, he did learn it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fellow is a little too pretentious, isn’t he?” Songat felt speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing I can do. Geniuses are always different from others.” Liszt lazily stretched his waist, then laughed, “Isn’t this pretty good. He was able to easily defeat Tyrin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hill and Tyrin have both been defeated… the chance of victory is only getting better and better for these little monsters from your Holy Dawn Academy.” As Songat observed Holy Dawn Academy’s team, this thought emerged in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This match has ended!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lead referee Clancy’s shout and the subsequent rush of a medical team onto the stage shattered any remaining traces of disbelief from the minds of the spectating Golden Stag Academy students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This idiot like fellow was actually this strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vast majority of spectating Golden Stag Academy students felt extremely uncomfortable as they had suffered a lost but didn’t have anyone to complain to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The resplendent light in midair disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham steadily landed onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not fighting anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m so ugly now, how can I keep fighting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone now looked at Stingham in a different light. Yet, against their expectations, he had a dispirited and angry expression on his face upon descending, as if he had been crying but his tears hadn’t come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After loudly crying out twice in an extremely dispirited manner, Stingham directly motioned that he was forfeiting towards Clancy and then quickly ran off the stage into the nearby preparation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He directly forfeited? Simply because his hair was too ugly on one side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Clancy was unable to respond as stood blankly atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Dawn Academy students in the stands were completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fellow clearly could have kept fighting, yet he decided to suddenly give up just like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t this fellow say he was going to defeat all of Golden Stag Academy’s team by himself and be the savior of Holy Dawn Academy? Why is he directly stepping down right after one fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin, Chris, and the others simultaneously looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the competition put the wishes of the competitor themselves first. Since Stingham himself had already indicated his decision to withdraw, even if they tied him up and threw him back up onto the stage, he wouldn’t be able participate anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carter gently sighed, then looked at the others, “Stingham didn’t have that many arcane particles left anyway. Trading two for two was already planned for as well. Belo, Ayrin, the rest relies on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A glint of light seemed to flash for a second as Belo pushed his glasses up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impetuous Freshman Belo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The next person appearing for our Holy Dawn Academy team is actually him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s another substitute who has yet to appear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that substitute member who made the bet with Hill over the loser licking the winner’s feet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Belo had only just stood up when a strange atmosphere descended over the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holy Dawn Academy’s students were full of shock and confusion, yet there was also an air of expectancy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Golden Stag Academy’s students, they felt full of unease and doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the midst of Golden Stag Academy’s team, a sharp faced boy with dark gray hair who gave off a sinister and morbid aura took a deep breath and began walking towards the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Plague Disseminator Zouchen versus Belo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had now become very obvious that Golden Stag Academy’s team was indeed using its full strength!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fellow…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Zouchen’s eyes, the glasses wearing Belo seemed extremely young and innocent. Based on common sense, it should be impossible for a freshman like Belo to compare with an arcane master like him who had experienced so many brutal battles and killed so many people as a member of one of House Baratheon’s arcane teams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But for some inexplicable reason, a strange feeling of discomfort emerged in Zouchen’s heart the moment he stepped onto the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Belo… just what kind of special training did Teacher Carter prepare for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin excitedly clenched his fists as he looked onwards, full of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has your body suddenly become filled with a strange feeling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Belo suddenly asked as he faced Zouchen atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?” Zouchen subconsciously furrowed his brows as he looked at Belo in a startled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Belo pushed his glasses up as an impetuous look emerged on his face, “I’m just letting you know what this feeling is… what you are feeling is the feeling a poisonous bug gets when it encounters a poisonous bug eating eagle. It is the feeling of having encountered a natural predator.”</span></p>
