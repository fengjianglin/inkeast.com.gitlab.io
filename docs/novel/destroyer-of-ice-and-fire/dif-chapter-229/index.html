 <p><strong>Chapter 229: If You Wish to Kill Me, You Must Put Your Life on the Line</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s face became twisted to the extreme as the gray gas of resentment twined around him surged like a tidal wave. However, before his image completely disappeared from the glass, he couldn’t move his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange and shocking scene unfolded before the spectators’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mirror started to slowly disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image of Ayrin gradually detached from the mirror’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ring of light around his body remained static as it also slowly exited the pane with him as if slowly passing through a door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He managed to break out of Rinsyi’s spiritual domain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jean Camus finally regained his composure as he looked towards Dragon Breath Academy’s team in the stands and he whispered under his breath, “Morgan, you were not wrong. In the future, this fellow will probably become my greatest opponent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even arcane masters whose spiritual strengths greatly surpass mine cannot break out of this domain. Ayrin, your spiritual strength is no where near mine, so how could you possibly defeat my domain?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s jarring voice rang through the arena once again, causing many spectators to feel great discomfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the most uncomfortable spectators were the students of Golden Stag Academy, because they could faintly tell that the unspeakable was happening, and that it couldn’t be stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The mirror has disappeared! The power of the domain is gone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin has escaped!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exclamations and cheers successively erupted across the stands!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so loud that some could feel their eardrums quivering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the image of Rinsyi also completely disappeared from the other side, the glass completely shattered and scattered into a wave of gray flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin’s light encircled body simultaneously reappeared atop the stage in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin was hunched over, giving the spectators a sensation that he was a wanderer who had lost track of how far he had traveled. He seemed as if his spirit had been completely exhausted as his expression was somewhat contorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes remained empty and dull, as if he hadn’t realized what had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the moment the colorful ring of light around his body created by Warlock Variation broke free of the abnormal power of the domain, it immediately continued to bloom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The colorful light collided with the extremely chaotic arcane energy and the gray gases of resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s body had regained the ability to move by this point, but at this moment, his body abruptly stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fluctuations inexplicably began undulating from the chaotic arcane energy in a strange rhythm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there was no obvious change atop the stage, everyone suddenly felt as if a monster was begin born in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liszt, who had finally relaxed and returned to his normal lazy self abruptly became tense and serious once more as his pupils contracted and a frosty light appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous spectators cried out in shock as a colossal gray figure suddenly appeared behind Rinsyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its entire body was gray and wreathed in the gray gases of resentment and it had a hideous contorted expression on its face. It looked almost the same as the current Rinsyi, only it was several times more horrifying to look at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi turned around in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of his turn, his body abruptly froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is… also a spiritual domain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single shocking notion flashed through his mind as Rinsyi motionlessly watched a slight sneer emerged on the face of the colossal Body of Vengeance behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two enormous hands abruptly enveloped Rinsyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy felt a calamitous danger descend atop the stage. He immediately went to stop the match, but he wasn’t fast enough as he sensed a powerful soul attack in the next moment, causing his face to abruptly turn pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s dim yellow pupils suddenly became a deathly gray color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying sneer on the colossal figure’s face abruptly widened, becoming visible enough for spectators to see. Many couldn’t help but cower from it in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, the colossal figure behind Rinsyi collapsed and turned into countless thin currents of gray gas which rushed towards Rinsyi’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what exactly has happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of arcane energy power has Ayrin’s Warlock Variation created?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s breathing stopped as they watched the countless thin strands of air mysteriously pass through one side of Rinsyi’s body and then back through the other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Rinsyi’s body had become immaterial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Curse of the Death Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Liszt and Songat almost simultaneously cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as they shouted, the countless currents of deathly gray gas passing through and winding around Rinsyi’s body completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi’s body had turned completely gray as he stood motionlessly atop the stage. He seemed to have lost all ability to function as he just faintly breathed without any hint of vitality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even his consciousness seems to have unraveled…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy and the assistant referees, who had gathered beside him, all sucked in a breath of cold air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, even the members of the two medical teams, who had been prepared to rush onto the stage, were completely dazed and lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any spiritual strength within Rinsyi’s body had been completely eradicated and his current behavior resembled someone who was brain dead, causing them to not know what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Curse of the Death Lord. A taboo skill used by some cursed arcane masters with abnormal bloodlines during the Era of the War with Dragons which uses all of one’s spiritual strength to curse the opponent and seal and extinguish their consciousness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Songat slowly sighed as he said, “It seems like House Baratheon’s Body of Vengeance is connected with the arcane skills of those zombie-like cursed arcane masters… is this what goes around comes around? Rinsyi wanted to use a powerful spiritual domain to destroy Ayrin’s spirit and turn him into a vegetable, yet in the end, it was he himself who ended up in this state.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are there still methods to heal him after being struck by the power of this taboo skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liszt slowly exhaled as he turned his head to look at Songat and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin’s Warlock Variation only reproduced a portion of the power of Curse of the Lord of Death, so perhaps there is a method to cure Rinsyi. However, I personally do not have one,” Songat replied as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liszt remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the best medical master of the Office of Special Affairs had no way of healing Rinsyi, then there was no one in the entire Kingdom of Eiche who could do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi used a spiritual attack, but it was broken through by Ayrin and he suffered a deadly blow in return… he’s become a vegetable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As more and more people recovered from their shock, cries began to erupt from all over the arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Dragon Breath Academy’s Morgan, along with many other members of the various participating teams, were completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holy Dawn Academy had defeated Golden Stag Academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this result had already been completely forgotten due to the shock generated by Rinsyi’s current state after suffering such an attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His current state was no different than if he had been directly killed off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had this battle caused the most brilliant genius of his generation from House Baratheon to eternally lose his place in the annals of the Kingdom of Eiche?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you wish to kill me, you must put your life on the line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, many people suddenly remembered the words which Ayrin had said to Rinsyi at the start of the match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi had indeed attempted to kill Ayrin, yet in the end, he had been beaten into this state where his life was on the line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We lost… even captain Rinsyi was…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the formerly arrogant and domineering students of Golden Stag Academy couldn’t hold back their tears any longer as they began to weep in the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment, everyone’s eyes abruptly widened once more as Ayrin, blinking his eyes as if he had just woken up from a dream, exclaimed in shock upon seeing Rinsyi’s vegetative state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We won!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin, this fellow…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The extremely worried Rinloran let out a sigh of relief as an unprecedented feeling of joy surged through his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This must be what true happiness feels like!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A resplendent smile appeared on the face of the eternally icy and hard to interact with Rinloran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin, nice victory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinloran loudly applauded Ayrin as he went to clap his hands, but because one of his arms was still unable to move, he was unable to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment, he saw Chris also only raise a single hand beside him. She seemed like she wanted to clap as well, but also only had one arm which could move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap! Clap! Clap! …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Driven by their indescribable emotions, Rinloran and Chris began to clap together with their respective hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image of these two ‘one-armed people’ clapping was quite comical, but at this moment, no one could laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Victory!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like waking up from a dream as countless cheers and shouts of celebration abruptly burst from the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The many students of Holy Dawn Academy began hugging their neighbors and applauding atop the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi was defeated just like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only now did Ayrin finally recover. As he looked at Rinsyi, he asked Clancy and the other, “How is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin! We will never let you go! We will definitely kill you and take our revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Clancy and the others could even respond, several substitutes of Golden Stag Academy had already shouted out in a maddened rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin looked blankly at them, then waved his fist at them as he said in a voice which was tired, but still full of conviction, “If you wish to kill me, then you must also put your own life on the line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His reply silenced the several Golden Stag Academy substitutes as they fell into a daze.</span></p>
