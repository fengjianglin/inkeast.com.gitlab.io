 <p><strong>Chapter 225: An Unbelievable Victory, The Ultimate Stinkbomb</strong>[/expand]</p>
 <p><span style>“This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, many spectators felt a sinister wind blow past them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enormous monstrosity emerged from the red light. Its body was completely covered in dark green hairs, except for over its head and back, which were covered in dark red hairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This monstrosity looked like a werewolf, as it had a similar skull structure and protruding fangs hanging from its mouth. However, several giant, human skull shaped mounds of flesh grew around its neck, causing a chill to run through the spectators’ hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clusters of dark gray arcane energy continuously circled around its body as a thick layer of frost appeared atop the stage around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Corpse Ghoul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing the being created by Megan’s arcane skill, the four House Eclipse Moon arcane masters in the stands began trembling uncontrollably as an intense and burning hatred emerged in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was House Roland’s number one secret skill, and also its hardest to learn skill. Of House Roland’s entire younger generation, only Megan had managed to learn it. In the past, several friends of these House Eclipse Moon members had died to this skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the unique aspect of this skill was that it would grow with every kill; its power would increase as it absorbed corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a terrifying feeling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin became astonished as he observed the green and red corpse ghoul standing before Megan. His muscles subconsciously began to tense up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, no way? Isn’t this tortoise a little too cowardly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the next moment, Ayrin became dumbfounded as he saw the black tortoise, which had been crawling towards Megan at a pace even slower than snail, sudden stop and retract its limbs into its shell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying corpse ghoul abruptly disappeared from its spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So fast! Is it because it’s body is condensed from various arcane energies, and thus very light?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin quickly realized that the corpse ghoul’s speed had already surpassed his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The tortoise moved? It’s begun rolling? And so quickly?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this tortoise trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin subconsciously used Tears of the Dark Goddess. Cries of shock suddenly erupted from the stands as Ayrin became dumbfounded once more. The retracted tortoise seemed to have turned into a black wheel as it rolled over at a shocking speed, leaving traces of afterimages behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dull sound rang across the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black tortoise had collided head on with the corpse ghoul, which was madly charging towards Ayrin. The two trembled as they separated from the concussive forces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It managed to block the corpse ghoul’s attack?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ayrin and Megan’s eyes both widened in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corpse ghoul also seemed to be perplexed as it attacked once more, but it was once again blocked by the black tortoise as another dong rang across the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can act like a sentient shield and block attacks by itself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so similar to the skill, Divine Tortoise Shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can he use Warlock Variation?!” Cocktail Grandmaster Leonardo was on the verge of going crazy as he pulled his hair in confusion and disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a brave tortoise. Warlock Variation is so fun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin became excited as he watched the scene unfold before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, a red light appeared below him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pool of blood took shape under his feet as his body seemingly melted away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… isn’t this Gezny’s arcane skill?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can he also know this skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Stag Academy’s students went half mad as Megan looked on in shock and disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Warlock Variation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment after Ayrin disappeared from atop the blood pool, he reappeared several meters away as a colourful ring of light spread from his body yet again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s coming out now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many spectators couldn’t help but stand from their seats in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan felt nervous as she didn’t immediately use another arcane skill and instead vigilantly waited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mysterious and chaotic arcane energy began to gather not to far before Ayrin, quickly forming a total of sixteen revolving silvery-white pillars of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of these pillars of light released any kind of offensive arcane energy. Moments later, a figure flashing with white light formed in the center of this ring of silvery-white pillars of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cries of shock erupted from the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What has Ayrin created this time?” Holy Dawn Academy’s team members were abruptly made speechless as the silvery-white pillars of light disappeared, revealing a snow white three headed monstrosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This monstrosity had the body of a semi-translucent frog and stood on only its hind legs. It had three perfectly round heads, upon which there was only a giant maw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment this monstrosity appeared, its three mouths powerfully opened and closed as it consecutively shot bursts of sonic waves towards the corpse ghoul and Megan, completely enveloping them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan’s face immediately contorted as countless jarring noises pierced her eardrums in succession, causing her head to feel like it was about to explode. She felt like she had suddenly been dropped into the midst of an extremely bad choir consisting of thousands of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the spectators, they didn’t hear a single thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elven Art, Hymn of Discord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Through usage of extremely dissonant sounds, the opponent is unable to focus their mind, making it extremely hard to use arcane skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Morgan bitterly laughed in the stands as he said, “Is Ayrin here to play or to compete? He keeps producing such strange things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what are you doing?! Can’t you take this fight seriously?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon God Fan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan seemed to have also lost some control of her emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following her shrill invocation, a current of green air billowed across her right hand as a massive green fan about the size of her body quickly condensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a snap, she opened the green fan, revealing the blood red fan leaves and countless floating green eyeballs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zap zap zap zap…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fan released countless greenish-red rays, completely shattering the sonic waves enveloping her and isolating her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These rays seemed to be faintly connected with each other as a domain of strong forces formed atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t a Materialization, but a strange domain skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of domain is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Jean Camus’s slightly furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roland Enticement Art”, “Slippery Serpent Body”, “Silent Decapitation”, “Death Lotus”, “Summon Corpse Ghoul”, and this domain which could not be seen through. Megan’s performance had already completely surpassed everyone’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For someone of Megan’s current strength to be completely suppressed by Ayrin and his lower arcane rank arcane particles could only be described as somewhat of a miracle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This guy is always trying any arcane skill which catches his eye,” Charlotte said helplessly, “Just like that god awful Skunk Devil Summoning. He just spontaneously uses it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, he likes that Skunk Devil Summoning so much, so why hasn’t he used it yet?” Iron Forest Academy’s Wilde suddenly reacted, “He used it several times during his days of training with boss and nearly suffocated us as we guarded the doorway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Skunk Devil Summoning!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Charlotte, Wilde, and the others all nearly fell out of their seats as Ayrin, as if he could hear their conversation, seemed to have suddenly remembered his favorite skill. His cheery invocation could be heard across the entire arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A striped skunk devil innocently fell from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Warlock Transformation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin’s face was full of excitement and expectation as a colorful ring of light immediately spread outwards from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of transformation will occur this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Leonardo, in his half-crazed state, couldn’t help but widen his eyes in anticipation as he had never combined Warlock Variation with this kind of arcane skill before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan immediately stopped breathing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it was enveloped in light, the striped skunk devil began to quickly inflate until it was about the size of a small elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it landed on the ground with a bang, the entire stage trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An attractive glow emanated from the fur on its body as light faintly formed a crown atop its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless spectators couldn’t help but cry out in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the moment it landed on the ground, the giant skunk immediately turned its body and pointed its ass at Megan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frrrrrtttttt…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, a ghastly greenish-yellow cloud spewed out and enveloped Megan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s another fart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This stench!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the spectators immediately became silent as a terrible, indescribable stench surged into their noses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blargh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The front row spectators closest to Megan abruptly stiffened and then began to twitch as they violently vomited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan, who faced the torrent of stench straight on, immediately turned to stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As some spectators continued to vomit, a white foam spewed out from Megan’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ergh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shrill scream came from her mouth as she fell backwards onto the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to have already fainted as white foam continued to spew out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She actually… directly fainted from the stench?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Window Huntress Megan actually fainted from just the stench? Such a powerful arcane master was actually defeated just like this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless spectators continued to dry heave as they watched Megan fall. The only thought running through their minds was that this scene couldn’t be described with words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It stinks!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It transformed into an extremely stinky bomb!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ayrin himself covered his nose with both of his hands as he dry retched several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This match has ended!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clancy’s face was turning green as he held his breath and waved the flag in his hand.</span></p>
