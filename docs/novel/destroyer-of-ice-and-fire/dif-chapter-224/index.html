 <p><strong>Chapter 224: A Tortoise Appears?</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Even after receiving such a severe wound, Belo still only focused on weakening his opponent… just what has pushed him to refine his blood and fight so hard? He’s not like Chris, who has the desire to complete her father’s dreams behind her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Liszt rubbed his chin as he quietly thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Belo…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin stepped out from Holy Dawn Academy’s corner and walked towards the stage. Upon reaching the edge of the stage, he paused for a moment, and then curled his hand into a fist. He felt like his blood was boiling as he loudly shouted, “For victory, Belo has ended up in such a state. I shall not let his sacrifice be in vain, and will defeat Megan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Ayrin will be the next on one stage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin has already recovered from his injuries?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the fourth fighter? Why is he not the anchor? Then who is Holy Dawn Academy team’s anchor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing Ayrin’s loud cries, everyone’s attention turned to him. As the spectators watched him step onto the stage and walk towards the center, many couldn’t help but stand up from their seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the spectators not from Golden Stag Academy, Ayrin was the Holy Dawn Academy team member they were most interested in watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But due to his injuries, he had been absent in the prior round. Thus, some couldn’t even believe their eyes as he walked atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin! Ayrin! Ayrin! …”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holy Dawn Academy’s student section abruptly erupted into cheers and cries of excitement like a volcano.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be able to rouse them to this level… it seems like he should be the one who Morgan considers talented enough to threaten me?” Morgan’s words reemerged in Jean Camus’s mind as he observed Ayrin. His eyes seemed to be burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fellow is coming out fourth? What exactly is Holy Dawn Academy planning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan’s face had become abnormally flushed as a power containing countless negative effects wandered through her body. She had no clue when the effect from Belo’s arcane skill would diminish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Regardless of what Holy Dawn Academy is planning, if their last member has the same strength as Stingham or Belo… and if Rinsyi is unable to recover his mental state, we will lose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After coldly glaring at Rinsyi, Megan took a deep breath and turned her head to watch the excited and confident Ayrin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m ready!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin had long since been waiting for this moment. The moment he reached his starting position, he immediately turned and spoke to Clancy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s like this, then let’s get this show on the road!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan’s eyes abruptly returned to a calm state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So direct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Stingham and Belo, Ayrin and Megan’s behaviour was just too straightforward. There was such a difference that the spectators were a little unprepared for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roland Enticement Art!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Clancy started to wave his flag to signal the start of the match, Megan immediately invoked her skill once again without any hesitation. Layer upon layer of pink chiffon like fog once again appeared atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Using this again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the spectators were ready this time, many once again fell into a stupor as the pink fog appeared. Lost in the world of temptations, they lost their sense of self and forgot everything existing around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Evil Flaming Eye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin’s invocation immediately caused all of these bewitched people to become clear headed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like Belo, Ayrin seemed to also be unaffected by this any of the images created by this powerful skill as he created an evil flaming eye and shot it towards Megan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s completely unaffected!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Wilde and the others were blushing heavily as the tips of their ears turned crimson. Unable to bear it any longer, they turned to Charlotte beside them and whispered, “Charlotte, we now believe that you and Ayrin have a completely pure relationship. It’s clear that this fellow knows absolutely nothing. Otherwise, how could he not be affected at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You assholes, go die!” Charlotte swore as her face and ears abruptly reddened while she continued to fixedly watch Ayrin atop the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can this be!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After watching her skill fail twice in a row, a feeling of incredulity surged through Megan’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But her actions weren’t affected at all as she fluidly continued to move. The gray rapier in her hand flew out and revolved around her before slicing towards Ayrin’s evil flaming eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silent Decapitation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the five fingers of her left hand slightly moved as a transparent and thin blade suddenly appeared behind Ayrin’s back and quietly slashed towards the back of Ayrin’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to hell, Belo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she used her arcane skill, Megan quietly swore at Belo. With all of the negative effects inflicted on her body, she realized her skill would be easily dodgeable by Ayrin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed. At this moment, Ayrin’s figure flashed and disappeared as he moved and reappeared behind her thin blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simultaneously, a colorful ring of light abruptly blossomed from Ayrin’s body at a rapid pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of arcane skill is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan’s suddenly pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan’s rapier had already destroyed evil flaming eye, but when the remnants of the evil flaming eye collided with the ring of light, it disappeared as if it had been devoured by something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the following instant, everyone’s eyes widened as a layer of black smoke arose and covered the entire stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless beautiful shadows suddenly emerged amidst the black smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ayrin had an expression of disbelief and surprise on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From within the black smoke, countless Rinloran like elves with pointy ears emerged, only their skin was black instead of a pale white and their hair was a dark red. They were all naked and had extremely desirable bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These elves smiled charmingly as they all licked their lips and rushed towards Megan in a bewitching manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dark Elves’ Seduction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean that highest level bewitchment art?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, the spectators collectively let out a breath of cold air in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wilde and the other students of Iron Forest Academy were stunned as their eyes widened in disbelief. He turned to Charlotte and asked, “Charlotte, just what have the two of you been doing? How is Ayrin able to use this kind of disgusting bewitchment art?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the famous Dark Elf’s Seduction art? The one which is rumored to have caused even the admirable and dignified lord of Ancient Foundation Island to die from exhaustion upon learning it because he couldn’t stop using it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more cries of disbelief emerged from the stands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why… can he use this arcane skill?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Death Lotus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill spread across Megan’s body. She knew that if the Dark Elf touched her, it would all be over as she wouldn’t be able to extricate herself from the bewitchment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she fiercely shouted, arcane particles began to wildly spew from her two hands. The rapier began to revolve even faster around her body as the metallic gray lotus reappeared and completely enveloped her. All of the Dark Elves were turned to mincemeat upon approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s not the real Dark Elves’ Seduction. It’s only manipulation of arcane energy to reach a similar effect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, a stunned Jean Camus whispered to himself, “Is this Leonardo’s cocktail ability?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that possible?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time in the stands, Leonardo nearly fell out of his seat as he saw the occurrence on stage. “How can he know my Warlock Variation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ayrin, this guy…” Chris and the other members of Holy Dawn Academy’s team were completely perplexed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It actually created such an effect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he stood atop the middle of the stage, Ayrin couldn’t help but embarrassedly chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless, this arcane skill had managed to wrest him control of the battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m coming again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Megan exerted her full powers to clear the Dark Elves, Ayrin’s hands extended outward before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One black bat after another suddenly began to shoot out from his hands towards Megan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As this arcane skill was used, the members of Golden Stag Academy’s team, as well as the students of Golden Stag Academy in the stands, all shouted in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clearly the arcane skill of Golden Stag Academy team’s Oeness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Ayrin use this arcane skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does he know Oeness’s arcane skill?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Megan couldn’t help but become slightly dispirited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slippery Serpent Body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Megan knew just how hard Oeness’s technique was to deal with, she subconsciously used a defensive skill. An oily white light surged over her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Warlock Variation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ayrin abruptly retracted his arms as another colourful ring of light spread outwards from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the flying black bats were overtaken by the ring of light, they began to contort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black tortoise about half the size of a person suddenly crashed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This tortoise seemed to be a real living creature, but upon seeing its dazed appearance, no one could completely figure out what the was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He summoned a tortoise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the meaning behind this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectators in the stands were all dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ayrin himself was also a bit stupefied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does it need a command?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he shouted a command at the blank-looking tortoise, he also shot out a stream of arcane particles at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the resulting action only caused him to become even more dumbfounded. Meanwhile, the spectators couldn’t help but break into laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing his command, the tortoise seemed to understand as it began to crawl towards Megan. The only issue was that it was crawling at a pace even slower than a snail!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this speed, it wouldn’t reach Megan until tomorrow, even if Megan didn’t move!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what is this arcane skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, it’s just too funny.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ayrin’s speechless and embarrassed appearance, an increasing number of spectators began to loudly guffaw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just too weird… indeed, this was the weirdness and abnormality which had become representative of Ayrin and the rest of Holy Dawn Academy’s team members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?! Go die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon Corpse Ghoul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Megan saw the scenario in front of her after dealing with Ayrin’s Dark Elves’ Seduction, she felt an inexplicable feeling of anger. Myriad streaks of scarlet light abruptly shot out from her ten fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A circle of blinding red light rose up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A figure even taller than three meters slowly stepped out from the circle of red light.</span></p>
