 <p><strong>Chapter 218: Tyrin’s Wild Ambition and Stingham’s Show</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, after receiving a warning from a vice-referee, Stingham began walking back towards center stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is he about to do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham was walking back when he seemed to have suddenly thought of something. Everyone’s eyes widened as they watched him stop and turn towards Golden Stag Academy’s team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait! Where’s Hill?” Stingham suddenly shouted towards Rinsyi and the other team members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hill? Didn’t he just suffer from Moss’s mutual destruction and get carried of the stage by the medical team?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectators were unable to follow Stingham’s train of thought and thus found his words incomprehensible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rinsyi and the other team members also blanked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and bring him back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham began to shout loudly, “Didn’t he make a bet with Belo where the loser had to lick the other’s feet? He hasn’t licked any feet yet, how can he just leave?! Hurry up and bring him back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire arena became silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“While on the stage, it is forbidden to provoke those off stage. Hurry up and come back so we can start the match. Otherwise, you will be disqualified,” main referee Clancy said, his face darkening. He was unable to put up with Stingham’s antics any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham’s face was full of melancholy and annoyance as he returned to his spot. As he walked, he couldn’t help but mutter, “But I wasn’t provoking anyone, I was just reminding them of a deal between men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you still fighting?” The seemingly aloof Tyrin suddenly barked at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a terrifying aura!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tyrin spoke, many nearby spectators simultaneously felt a slight tingle pass through their skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham nonchalantly gestured towards Clancy, indicating that he was ready.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Clancy was about to wave the flag and signal the start of the match, Stingham interrupted once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After calling for a stop, Stingham combed his hair then took an offensive posture which he thought as handsome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, many spectators nearly fell out of their seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’m ready!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stingham versus Tyrin. Start!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afraid that Stingham might do something else, Clancy almost immediately waved his flag and called for the match to start.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rip!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of chatter within the arena was abruptly interrupted by the sound of space being torn apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one had seen Tyrin move, yet a black sphere covered in countless currents of black electricity had already appeared in front of Stingham’s chest as Clancy waved his flag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silent-invocation skill! Such a fast casting speed! Tyrin is much more terrifying than last year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These thoughts hadn’t passed through many spectators’ minds when Stingham suddenly reached forward with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham maintained his “handsome” pose as his hand diagonally extended into the space before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raging dark-red flames surged onto his hand as it extended outwards. The black sphere of arcane energy, which was about to collide with his clothes, suddenly changed directions and flew into the palm of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bang rang through the arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black sphere had been destroyed by Stingham’s hand and turned into countless scattering black flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahahaha, I’m the most handsome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After popping a black sphere with his hand, Stingham immediately began laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Death’s Clutch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must have hurt a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his hand was indeed in pain, Stingham tried to cover it up and maintain a pose which he considered chic and handsome. However, due to a slight contortion of Stingham’s face, many people were able to realize that his hand was in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So fast…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He actually used an arcane skill like that to break through Tyrin’s attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This idiotic fellow… is actually a special genius?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham’s expression and appearance were especially ridiculous, yet not a single person laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Death’s Clutch was a short-ranged attacking skill. Only if Stingham’s invocation rate was no slower than Tyrin’s would he be able to catch Tyrin’s arcane sphere with it. Moreover, Stingham had endured the explosive power contained with the sphere. This meant that not only had the strength of his arcane energy surpassed Tyrin, but that his body was physically strong as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Stingham had clearly suffered some pain, his fingers were still all fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“During last year’s tournament, Tyrin had opened three arcane gates. Could it be that this substitute of Holy Dawn Academy has already opened four?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This fellow, he wasn’t just all talk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This idiotic fellow who hasn’t appeared until now is actually this strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy Dawn Academy were actually hiding a powerhouse like him this entire time?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing his black sphere crushed by Stingham, Tyrin didn’t immediately attack again. He silently observed Stingham, waiting, but Stingham didn’t try to counterattack. The two motionlessly stood atop the stage as the stands descended into turmoil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The strength of their arcane particles is about the same. Neither should have opened the fourth gate yet. However, it seems like Stingham’s affinity with arcane energy is greater than Tyrin’s. Thus, even if they use the same level of arcane skills and consume the same number of arcane particles, Stingham’s skill will be more powerful than Tyrin’s skill. Moreover, Stingham’s body is much stronger. This is an issue caused by the difference in bloodlines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the stands, Morgan whispered in disbelief, “This Stingham fellow… he has a high level dragon bloodline?! Holy Dawn Academy was actually still hiding another high level bloodline?! They have Rinloran’s high level elf bloodline as well as this fellow’s dragon bloodline?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A high level dragon bloodline…” Just like how Morgan couldn’t hold it in any longer, an abnormal light flickered through the calm Jean Camus’ eyes on the other side of the stands as he quietly muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>......</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So this is where your arrogance and self-confidence is all stemming from, your high level dragon bloodline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst the cries of shock and slander, Tyrin turned his head and looked at Rinsyi and his teammates from the center of the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rinsyi, even you have felt the pressure and let it affect you. You are no longer as confident as before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin inwardly whispered to himself. But his external appearance remained the same, he seemed to still be feeling a chill and aloof, and his face was emotionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the eyes of others, Rinsyi would seem to be incomparably calm at this moment. However, those familiar with Rinsyi could see the anxiety, anger, and uncertainty which had emerged within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hill isn’t the only one who has been aiming to defeat you… Captain Rinsyi, I have also always dreamed of defeating and surpassing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your current appearance tells me that you are not so powerful that I cannot surpass you… since it is like this, I will have even more of a reason to fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he coldly thought to himself, Tyrin, who seemed to be the most harmless, slow, and low-key member of Golden Stag Academy’s team, turned his head and looked at Stingham again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such an intense killing intent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tyrin’s aura has become even stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The majority of the audience felt as if Tyrin had become even more terrifying than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, what do you think, am I handsome or what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire audience nearly fell onto their faces as Stingham motioned towards Tyrin and once again narcissistically laughed out loud in response to Tyrin’s terrifying change as if he hadn’t felt it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tyrin’s about to use his entire strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of those spectators who had seen Tyrin’s matches before subconsciously opened wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rip!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The space around Tyrin’s body suddenly distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A total of thirteen arcane spheres covered with black light emerged, one after another, between his hands. Afterwards, the spheres all shot out before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simultaneously, his body began to float in the air as if he had suddenly become weightless. Tyrin began flying around the arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every ten meters, yet another black sphere quietly appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fluctuations of arcane energy coming from these arcane spheres are so strong! So powerful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ayrin intently watched, he couldn’t help but shout out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s really like a mother bird, leaving behind a ball every couple meters,” Ayrin couldn’t help but quietly add.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh… whoosh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each and every one of Tyrin’s black spheres looked exactly the same. From the fluctuations of arcane energy they released, it was likely that many people couldn’t even receive an attack from one of them. The fluctuations were so intense that countless chaotic small tornadoes were formed atop the stage, causing the sound of violently gusting wind to spread across the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time, another shocking scene appeared as Stingham just casually pulled out his comb and brushed his hair!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liszt, this fellow from your academy is just quite a character, but it’s too much, no?” In a corner of the stands, even the perverted medical master Songat couldn’t take it any longer as he huffed and shouted at Liszt, who was lazily leaning against a wall behind him, causing bits of the pie he was currently chewing to fly everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing we could do. Even Rui had headaches due to this fellow,” Liszt responded. He couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin’s body continued flying over the arena. Already, more than thirty black spheres had emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scryer: Spheres of a Corrupt Angel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Tyrin’s arms abruptly flapped like wings as he quickly chanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six black arcane spheres emerged at different positions around Stingham’s body and simultaneously began accelerating towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black light from the spheres connected, forming a hexagonal ring around Stingham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six black arcane spheres were over ten meters away from Stingham, but the black image of a winged angel had already taken form atop the formation. It wielded a giant sword of judgement with arcane energy revolving around it in its hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of taboo skill is this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such power! The condensed arcane energy is too terrifying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This feeling, it’s very similar to Dark Destruction Dragon. It must be a purely destructive offensive skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of Ivan and the others immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tyrin’s strength was even greater than they had imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment, a green sheen, which only Clancy and the other referees could see, suddenly emerged within Stinghan’s eyes as if they had suddenly turned into two emeralds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stingham’s right arm was like a longsword as it fiercely swung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A stream of deep green particle shot out from the palm of his hand, creating a ten meter long beam of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This deep green beam of particles wasn’t directed towards the corrupt angel by his head, but at empty space. Yet, a moment later, the corrupt angel suddenly shattered and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Atop the stands, Dragon Breath Academy captain Morgan unconsciously stood up from his seat.</span></p>
