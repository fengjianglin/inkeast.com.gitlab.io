<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are so many immortal dao sects?” said a shocked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those sects are the most powerful sects in the Northern Plains. In addition, there are also those second-rate and third-rate sects. Who knows how many sects there are? Existences like the Six Great Sky Grottoes can’t even be considered a third-rate sect. If not for the power backing them from behind, a somewhat powerful cultivator could easily annihilate them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those immortal dao sects have their own unique aspects. Pill Ding Sect specializes in pill concoction, Jade Talisman Sect’s sect-guarding techniques involves talismans, Sword Hall specializes purely in the training of swordsmanship and possesses high offensive power. They have an overbearing way of conduct. The moment they decide to take action, they will go for the kill and the other sects are generally wary of provoking them. Flowing Cloud Hall’s Skyward Cloud Sword Formula is said to be an immortal legacy received from the Immortal Plane. After cultivating the formula, one can become an immortal and ascend. The Starfall Sect’s cultivation involves the stars. The cultivation techniques of the Extreme Celestial Sect and Skypond Faction are more complicated. As for the Purple Firmaments, Nine Firmaments and Transcendent Firmaments Palace, the three of them share the same cultivation techniques. Supposedly, their techniques are also immortal techniques that have been passed down since ancient times,” said Ye Ziming in detail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After having said that, Ye Ziming noticed both Chen Feng and Lu Ta looking at him with curious expressions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why are you two giving me that look?” Ye Ziming could not stop himself from asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Didn’t you say you come from the Central Plains?” asked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is correct.” Ye Ziming nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“But how do you know so much about the Northern Plains?” asked Chen Feng again with a puzzled look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. I have been living here in the Northern Plains since little, yet I only know a small bit about those immortal dao sects. How could you know so much about them?” Lu Ta asked as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“About that, ha ha! I have been reading a lot of books since I was little, especially books regarding the various sects of our Eternal World. I even did some research on them. It is only normal for me to know a little about them.” Ye Ziming laughed out. It would appear that he was unwilling to talk too much about it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, neither Chen Feng nor Lu Ta chose to let him shift the topic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Ye, no matter how you cut it, we have braved through life and death. Can’t you tell us about your true situation?” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. We consider you as a friend. Shouldn’t you at least tell us a little about it?” said Lu Ta with a smile as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! I am just a loose cultivator from the Central Plains. I have nothing to hide,” replied Ye Ziming with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t even know how much distance there is between the Northern Plains and the Central Plains. Even for a flying Concealed stage cultivator, it will take probably tens of years to cover that distance. It may even take over a hundred years. Could you have used your spatial magic to travel all the way here? Tsk tsk! Cultivators from the Central Plains sure are rich,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It makes me yearn for it. Brother Ye, when will you bring us to the Central Plains for a tour?” asked Lu Ta.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The opportunity will surely come,” replied Ye Ziming affably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that Ye Ziming was unwilling to divulge any more than that, the two of them stopped asking questions. Everyone had their own secrets after all. Besides, their relationship had not reached the point where they can share everything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not far from here is a fairly sizable city. It is called White Cloud City. Although it is within the Nine Firmaments Palace’s territory, it is controlled by various forces. Many sects have established their own strongholds within the city. After entering the city, we can try to find for more information. Didn’t you say you want to join a sect to practice cultivation? Just spend some money to buy up some information and try to get an understanding of what is going on,” said Ye Ziming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is a good idea.” Chen Feng nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the three wasted no time and leapt upwards, driving their flying swords through the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One day later, the three of them arrived at White Cloud City. The instant Chen Feng laid his eyes on White Cloud City, he became flabbergasted. In his opinion, Black Origin City, with its population size of millions, was big enough as it was. However, when compared with the White Cloud City standing before his eyes, Black Origin City was practically a thatched hut standing beside a palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Its wall rose to a height of a hundred metres, constructed with rocks weighing tens of thousands of jin. Cultivators with sharp eyesight and divine sense will note that the surface of every inch of the wall was glowing with light. Clearly, it had been strengthened by some powerful figures using magic. Should its defensive magic array be activated, the city wall would be capable of holding off the attacks of numerous cultivators (1 jin = 0.5 kg).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The matter that shocked Chen Feng the most was that he was incapable of seeing the end point of the city wall. Just to point out, with his eyesight power, Chen Feng could see a building that was tens of li into the distance on flat terrain (1 li = 0.5 km).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Additionally, he could vaguely make out a number of mountains towering up from within the city, rising up into the clouds. Trees thrived upon the mountain surface; mists and clouds surged through every corner of the mountain. Occasionally, he could see various celestial-like cranes and birds circling around. The mountains rose all the way into the clouds and he could not see the mountaintop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A grand and lofty aura of eminence rushed forward to greet them, sending feelings of utter shock into their hearts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is White Cloud City? It is too unbelievable. The Immortal Plane is likely only at this level,” said Chen Feng. By then, Chen Feng’s evaluation of Black Origin City had fallen once again, from thatched hut into a kitchen stove.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Where did this country bumpkin come from?” A ridiculing voice suddenly rang out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A flamboyant-looking young man riding a variant beast while under the protection of a group of body guards charged over. Strong winds rose in their wake and clumps of smoke rolled about. He was extremely arrogant. When he was moving past Chen Feng’s group, he sent a contemptuous glance at them before continuing on his way.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why is that fellow so arrogant?” Chen Feng could not stop himself from blurting out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Must be the Young Master of some family. Although he is only at level 2 of the Concealed stage, the 12 body guards around him are all at level 4 of the Concealed stage. Additionally, the two old men beside him are even stronger. I cannot identify their level of strength. Even the variant beast that he is riding is at level 2 of the Concealed stage,” said Ye Ziming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cultivators at level 4 of the Concealed stage for body guards?” Chen Feng was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is the son of Purplecloud Sky Grotto’s Sect Master. Some time ago, he was accepted as a disciple of Nine Firmaments Palace. It is said that he was even given a magic treasure. He has become insufferably arrogant and a figure that no ordinary cultivators could provoke,” said someone nearby.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yeah, I heard that a level 5 Concealed stage cultivator had, not long ago, simply said something after finding him distasteful. That cultivator was instantly captured, his blood, essence and magic power were all extracted and processed into a magic treasure.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It turns out he has become a disciple of Nine Firmaments Palace. However, I wonder if he is an outer disciple or an inner disciple. Judging by his level of strength, he should just be an outer disciple. Still, he is being too arrogant. Without a suitable level of strength, he will end up dying without even knowing what hit him,” said Ye Ziming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He truly is insufferably arrogant. If only I possess enough power, I would have slapped him senseless for his words earlier,” said Chen Feng with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is said that this White Cloud City had required the manpower of over ten thousand Concealed stage cultivators and 10 years to build. Its wall is imbued with various defensive magic spells, capable of holding off attacks from even Sky Human stage cultivators. The city stretches out a distance of 200 li into both east and west, and 300 li into both north and south. Normally, its population size is between 30 million to 50 million people. The tallest mountain in the city rises to a height of at least 3,000 zhang. There are many cultivators practicing cultivation within the mountains.” As Ye Ziming was very familiar with White Cloud City, he started explaining the details to Chen Feng (1li = 0.5 km; 1 zhang = 3.333 m).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Impressive. It seems I have been an ignorant frog at the bottom of the well. I wonder though, how important is this city within our Eternal World?” said Chen Feng in a self-deprecating manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A lowly existence,” said Ye Ziming calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Hearing that left Chen Feng flabbergasted once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Truth be told, this is still considered a city of the mundane realm. It doesn’t count as much. A true immortal dao sect will not look like this.” Suddenly, Ye Ziming’s eyes stared off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems you have been to an immortal dao sect before?” Chen Feng suddenly asked him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have only heard about it,” Ye Ziming hastily replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s enter the city, ha ha! This is also my first time here. I must have a good look around,” said Lu Ta cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two rows of mighty-looking soldiers stood before the tall city gate. One glance was all it took for Chen Feng to identify that every soldier there possessed a cultivation base of the astral energy (6<sup>th</sup>) layer. With this level of cultivation base, they could stand out amongst the crowd within Black Origin City. However, here in White Cloud City, they could only qualify to guard the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Two Basic Yang Pills per head,” one of the soldiers there said to them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why did you not take anything from the two that passed by earlier?” Lu Ta spoke up with a displeased tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knew that the Basic Yang Pill was a common form of currency for the cultivation world, concocted using the worldly spiritual energy. Cultivators could refine the Basic Yang Pills in their cultivation practice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mm, they are Concealed stage experts. It is only natural that they do not need to pay the fee for entering the city. One look is all I need to tell that you three are inexperienced country bumpkins. Could it be you do not have any Basic Yang Pills on you?” said the soldier with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If you fellows don’t have the pills, then run back to where you came from. This place is not for lowly plebs like you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing those words infuriated Chen Feng. Their actions were practically that of a dog looking down on a human! The three of them had been through a great deal of battles and looked worse for wear. However, the three of them were still genuine Concealed stage cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is wrong with your eyes? I will have you know, this senior here is a Concealed stage cultivator!” Lu Ta was unable to stop himself from shouting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Just look at you fellows. Concealed stage cultivators? You can’t even produce Basic Yang Pills and you call yourself Concealed stage cultivators?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The group of soldiers outside the city gate immediately burst into a round of laughter. They had been standing guard for the whole day and were feeling bored. Thus, they were in need of entertainment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A snapping sound rang out as the foremost soldier was slapped unconscious. Chen Feng was finally incapable of holding himself back. In the past, when he was weak, he had suffered from a considerable amount of humiliation. Since gaining power, Chen Feng vowed to himself to not be the subject of bullying again. Should there ever be bullying, it should be him bullying others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The instant Chen Feng made his move, the rest of the soldiers made to surround them. However, Chen Feng sent out a strand of divine sense, which swept around. Next, the soldiers clutched their heads and cried out wretchedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A divine sense attack of that level was useless against other Concealed stage cultivators. However, against ordinary cultivators like the soldiers, he was practically bullying the weak.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You guys really are Concealed stage cultivators!” shouted one of the soldiers. Next, the soldiers turned and ran away. It did not take long for them to disappear from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon enough, another two teams of soldiers marched out and once again took up position on either side of the city gate. It seemed as though the earlier incident had never occurred.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems Brother Chen has understood the law of the cultivation world,” said Ye Ziming with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Law? What law?” asked Chen Feng with a puzzled look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Might makes right,” replied Ye Ziming with that same smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s head inside.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, the soldiers guarding the city gate did not stop them. Instead, they looked at the three of them reverently as they walked into the city.</span></p>
