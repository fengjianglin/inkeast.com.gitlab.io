 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, I am going to undergo Lightning Tribulation.” After saying that, Jian Xiaotian’s figure became like a sword piercing through space. In just the blink of an eye, he was already hundreds of metres away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He’s undergoing Lightning Tribulation again? His rate of cultivation is so fast!” Chen Feng was shocked. Even so, he went after Jian Xiaotian. There was no need to worry that others might interfere with the Lightning Tribulation. However, after overcoming Lightning Tribulation, he would be badly wounded and some cultivators might try to plunder the burning house.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After putting a distance of several hundred li between himself and the meteorite, Jian Xiaotian was finally incapable of suppressing his aura. It broke out and dark clouds began gathering up above. Thunder rumbled as his Lightning Tribulation began gathering power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This Lightning Tribulation came swiftly. One joss stick’s worth of time after Jian Xiaotian released his aura, a lightning sphere blasted down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bring it!” Jian Xiaotian swung the great sword in his hand to instantly shatter the lightning sphere apart. The broken lightning sphere then transformed into strands of energy, which flowed into Jian Xiaotian’s body, where they began tempering his fleshly body and soul.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the successive lightning powers were all very powerful, all of them were smashed apart by Jian Xiaotian. The atmosphere radiating from Jian Xiaotian’s body was even more ferocious compared to when he was undergoing his previous Lightning Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian seems to be having an easy time. This Lightning Tribulation should not be an issue, right?” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower did not answer him. Instead, he swiftly flew up into the dark clouds where he began devouring the Lightning Tribulation’s power. As expected, due to the Longevity Tower’s interference, the Lightning Tribulation grew more violent, becoming several times stronger. In the end, however, Tower managed to secretly devour all of it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the Lightning Tribulation ended, Jian Xiaotian sat cross-legged on the ground to recover and sense the changes to his body after levelling up. As for the Longevity Tower, it flew back into Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Too weak! It simply cannot match up against the tribulation lightning of a Human Immortal’s tribulation. This cannot help me much, but it is quite a decent item for your cultivation practice,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I still feel there is not enough time,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. Just wait until I recover a little bit more of my powers and I will be able to accelerate time inside the tower. When that happens, all you need to do is complain that cultivation is boring,” Tower said with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Time acceleration? You mean like those Immortal artefacts? One day outside is the equivalent of one year outside?” Chen Feng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is what I mean. However, I am not strong enough. I still need to advance another level. Any other magic treasures would require reaching the Immortal tier before they can accelerate time. However, I am different! Even without reaching the Immortal tier, I can also accelerate time. Of course, there is a requirement. It consumes spirit stones,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it is empowered using spirit stones. Still, there are many spirit stones inside the tower,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! So, someone was overcoming Lightning Tribulation here! This is a good opportunity. You guys, go and kill that fellow. Then, seize all his items and bring them to me.” A group of cultivators appeared from the distance, flying towards them. Even from afar, they had noticed Jian Xiaotian, who was focused on healing himself. One of them was a young, red-haired cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll do it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A muscular man with cheek line beard descended from the sky and his hand reached out to grab Jian Xiaotian, who was seated still on the ground. That was no ordinary move. Red-coloured flames suddenly appeared across the muscular man’s palm. The flames gathered and the muscular man’s palm seemingly grew twice as large.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Kid, get over here!” The muscular man’s face revealed a savage grin as his palm moved to grasp Jian Xiaotian’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian had noticed the incoming attack the moment the muscular man made his move. However, he did not panic. Neither did he take action to resist. He knew that Chen Feng would surely take action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, just as the muscular man’s palm was about to grab Jian Xiaotian, a beam of sword light suddenly flashed out. It was so fast that the muscular man did not notice it before seeing his palm mysteriously dropping off his arm. The severed part was so clean that no blood trickled out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” The muscular man’s eyes were wide open. Before he could figure out what was happening, he felt a searing pain on his chest and his body felt lighter. Next, a power of destruction enveloped his entire figure and his vision turned dark as he lost all his senses.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even in death, the muscular man did not know what had happened to him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng appeared before Jian Xiaotian, a flaming sword in his hand. It was the Eight Trigrams Fire Sword that he had acquired from the firewasps in the Seven Kills Direlands. It was a grade 6 Prized artefact, capable of splitting up into several swords to form an Eight Trigrams Array when facing its enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the power of the Twin Swords of Life and Death was very powerful, it consumed too much power. Given Chen Feng’s present level of strength, he could not fully master them. On the other hand, Chen Feng was capable of unleashing a major portion of this grade 6 Prized artefact’s power. Additionally, it also felt easy to use.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, Chen Feng had utilized his flaming sword to casually cut off the muscular man’s hand. Next, he cleaved the muscular man’s body from the waist down. The power of fire within the sword then destroyed the muscular man’s vitality in the fastest time possible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the cultivator from their side killed so easily, the remaining cultivators there were either shocked or enraged. One after another, they landed and strode towards Chen Feng. Two amongst them were gathering their magic powers, ready to unleash attacks at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the Eight Trigrams Fire Sword in his hand split up into eight swords, which hovered around both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Raging flames instantly burst out from the eight swords. The flames linked up to quickly form a circular barrier of flames, keeping the cultivators outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Playing fire before us from the Holy Flame Sect? You don’t know the meaning of death! Which one of you will break this barrier for me?” The red-haired youngster laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Watch me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A thin and rather unassuming-looking youngster walked forward. Opening his mouth, he sprayed out a stream of dark-red flames. The flames were like earthen fire and they surged with extremely ferocity towards the barrier that Chen Feng had set up, causing crackling sounds to ring out. Fiery heat waves spread out into the surrounding space as the ground began melting. Even the waters in the distant lakes were beginning to swiftly evaporate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good! Sixth Junior Brother’s Holy Skyburn Flame has improved. Looks like those two fellows will not be able to withstand it. They will surely be burned to ash!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It won’t be that easy. The opponent’s magic treasure is a fairly high-grade fire-type sword. Given Sixth Junior Brother’s strength, it will be somewhat difficult to break the barrier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, I will help him.” Another cultivator stepped forward. Both his hands moved to form one hand seal after another and the surrounding power of fire began condensing, transforming into fire arrows, which shot towards the barrier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Holy Flame Sect. These two are displaying fire techniques.” A look of surprise flashed across Chen Feng’s eyes. Next, his mind linked up with the Eight Trigrams Fire Sword and the eight swords instantly spun. Next, one astral sword after another shot furiously towards the two attacking cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two attacking cultivators were only at level 3 of the Sky Human stage. As for Chen Feng, the flaming sword he was using was a grade 6 Prized artefact. Two astral swords were enough to send the two attacking cultivators flying. Additionally, the power of fire within the two astral swords set the two attacking cultivators ablaze. Not only that, after sending the two attacking cultivators flying, there were still more astral swords, which shot towards the other cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!” The red-haired youngster finally took action. He waved his hand and the astral swords shooting towards them were all absorbed into his palm. Even the flames on the other cultivators, who were rolling on the ground, were absorbed into his palm. Then, he tightened his grip to crush the flames. After that, the red-haired youngster swung his hand at the nearby barrier of fire. A huge, flaming palm silhouette slammed against the barrier. First, that part of the barrier sank to form a concave. Next, like a bubble, it burst.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the barrier of fire was broken, eight flaming swords united to become one sword. The sword, burning with raging flames, charged towards the red-haired youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fire technique, Dual Fire Palms!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Both of the red-haired youngster’s hands kept moving to form one magic seal after another. Next, two large flaming palm silhouettes appeared up in the sky. The red-haired youngster abruptly slapped both his palms together and the two fire palms followed suit, slapping together to entrap the flaming sword that Chen Feng had sent out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? This youngster has some skills.” Seeing his attack stopped, Chen Feng felt surprised. Thus, he increased his soul power to increase the might of the flaming sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The flaming sword’s power of fire was something extracted from the sun throughout the years. As for the red-haired youngster’s fire palms, their power of fire came from their surroundings and the red-haired youngster’s own cultivation base. The clash between the two caused popping sounds to ring out ceaselessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The flaming sword kept vibrating, but the two fire palms kept it tightly clamped. As for the red-haired youngster, he dared not retract his power. Thus, the situation became a deadlock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are you fellows spacing out for? Hurry up and attack!” the red-haired youngster shouted. At the same time, flames burst out from his entire body and the fire palms up in the air grew denser.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! This sword is not bad. A fire-type sword that can split up to set up an array. Since I have taken a fancy to it, it is now mine.” The red-haired youngster wanted the flaming sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! That’s right! Young master has stopped this fellow’s magic treasure. His powers must be greatly weakened now. Watch as I kill him!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t fight me for it. I should do it. I have not killed anyone for the past few days, it’s practically suffocating me to death here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Blazing Skyburst Fist!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dual Wave Flames!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two cultivators rushed out to attack Chen Feng simultaneously, one from the left and one from the right. One unleashed a flaming fist while the other one unleashed waves of sky-encompassing flames that looked like tidal waves. They wanted to engulf Chen Feng with their attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you fellows think that I only have one magic treasure? You are too stupid.” Chen Feng smirked. With a grasping motion, the Fire Wyrm Sword appeared in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Fire Wyrm Sword, a grade 9 Prized artefact, forged using the fangs of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm. Both its grade and power were at a level that the earlier Eight Trigrams Fire Sword could not hope to match.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wielding the Fire Wyrm Sword, Chen Feng displayed the Longevity Sword Technique. With one sword move, the fist exploded and half of the attacking cultivator’s body disappeared. Another sword move cleaved the waves of flames, causing them to split to the sides. As for the attacking cultivator, he was cleaved into two from top to bottom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad! It’s another high-grade Prized artefact!” Seeing Chen Feng kill off the two cultivators in quick succession, the remaining cultivators who were rushing forward immediately halted. A look of dread escaped their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
