 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where we are? We should have left Extreme Celestial Sect, right?” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, how far away did we jump?” Chen Feng secretly asked Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“19,000 kilometres,” Tower swiftly answered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>19,000 kilometres? In other words, we are already outside Extreme Celestial Mountain. However, we are still within Extreme Celestial Sect’s territory,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are no cultivators here. Let’s go find some people and ask them first,” Chen Feng suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian nodded. Next, his great sword rapidly descended. When they finally landed, the great sword flew back to rest on Jian Xiaotian’s back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They were quite lucky. It did not take them long to find three cultivators. One glance at the three revealed that they were ordinary loose cultivators. The strongest amongst them was only at level 3 of the Concealed stage. They were ant-like existences before Chen Feng’s team.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After questioning the three cultivators, Chen Feng’s team learned that they were within Sift Mountain, under Myriad Sift Empire’s jurisdiction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Myriad Sift Empire, Sift Mountain.” Jian Xiaotian quickly brought out a piece of jade stone. Tapping it with his finger, he caused a map to appear before them. One glance was all it took for Chen Feng to realize that it was a map of the Northern Plains. However, it was quite crude. The only places marked on the map were some important mountains and rivers, empires and sects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is Myriad Sift Empire and this is Sift Mountain. There is a distance of over 15,000 kilometres between this place and Extreme Celestial Sect. In other words, we are still within Extreme Celestial Sect’s territory,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right now, both Extreme Celestial Sect and Nine Firmaments Palace are pursuing us. In the Northern Plains, offending any one of the immortal dao sects means death. Right now, we have offended both. Ha ha! I wonder how many more days do we have to live?” Chen Feng said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They shouldn’t be able to catch up to us so quickly. Besides, they will have to pay a steep price if they want to kill us,” Lin Shaokun said icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Check how far Azuremist Mountain is from here,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Azuremist Mountain is located within Transcendent Firmaments Palace’s territory. There are 150,000 kilometres to cover. Tsk, tsk. This will be troublesome,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So far? Not to mention, it is located within Transcendent Firmaments Palace’s territory.” Chen Feng knitted his brows. There was none within the Northern Plains who did not know that Nine Firmaments Palace, Transcendent Firmaments Palace and Purple Firmaments Palace shared the same roots. Long ago, all three used to be one sect. If they head to Transcendent Firmaments Palace, wouldn’t they end up getting attacked by cultivators from Transcendent Firmaments Palace?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what do you think?” Jian Xiaotian asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t have any way to deal with this either. For a distance of over 100,000 kilometres, we’ll definitely have to use teleportation arrays. However, that is only available within large cities. Since Nine Firmaments Palace have already taken action, they must have mobilized a high number of people to monitor the teleportation arrays within the cities,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. We cannot enter cities now, not even small cities.” Jian Xiaotian nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If so, we can only find someplace to hide,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Judging by the looks of it, that is the only thing we can do. The Northern Plains cover a radius of at least tens of millions of li. Can the three of us not hide ourselves here?” Jian Xiaotian laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, let’s not pause. Hurry up and find a place to hide. It will be difficult to get away once some powerful cultivators get to us,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After coming to the decision, the three of them began moving. In order to avoid attracting attention, they changed their attires. Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian kept their weapons as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng held a map made from unknown materials as he moved forward. It was a crude and simplistic map that Chen Feng had casually brought out from the Longevity Tower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, Chen Feng’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pot Mountain!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng whispered out. After seeing the words Pot Mountain on the map, Chen Feng was immediately reminded of the Pot Brothers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There is a distance of 50,000 kilometres between this place and Pot Mountain. I nearly forgot about the five brothers,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is it, Brother Chen?” Seeing Chen Feng spacing out, Jian Xiaotian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you fellows know Pot Mountain?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pot Mountain? No.” Jian Xiaotian shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pot Mountain?” Lin Shaokun’s eyes glinted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? Brother Lin knows about Pot Mountain?” Chen Feng asked smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course. To outsiders, Pot Mountain is just an ordinary place. Additionally, as Pot Mountain is not too large, people from the cultivation world and even ordinary people do not know about the place. However, I know that it is not an ordinary place,” Lin Shaokun said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you mean by not ordinary?” Jian Xiaotian’s curiosity was aroused by Lin Shaokun’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh? Do you two know why I would go around hunting yao beasts and collecting their cores?” Lin Shaokun suddenly changed the topic of discussion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, why? Is it not for pill concoctions?” Jian Xiaotian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are for my master’s recuperation needs,” Lin Shaokun said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You master’s recuperation needs?” Both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian revealed looks of shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My master is a Human Immortal, but he is seriously wounded. Due to his cultivation technique, he requires a high number of natural treasures to heal himself. However, natural treasures are difficult to find. Thus, I have to go for the next best thing, hunt yao beasts and collect their cores,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human Immortal!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Absorb and refine yao cores?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian exclaimed simultaneously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Lin, I didn’t think that your master could be a Human Immortal. I believe your master’s wounds must be connected to Pot Mountain,” Chen Feng suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. My master was wounded in Pot Mountain. However, I do not know the specifics,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>So, that is what happened. Back then, the Pot Brothers did mention that Pot Mountain is an ancient immortal mountain. However, despite having lived in Pot Mountain for tens of years, they were unable to find anything. To think that even a Human Immortal can end up getting wounded there. Looks like Pot Mountain is truly not an ordinary place,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, why did you ask about Pot Mountain?” Lin Shaokun cast a curious gaze at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have several friends living there,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Interesting. If we have the time, we should visit Pot Mountain and have a look. We might come across immortal serendipity,” Jian Xiaotian said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Despite being a Human Immortal, my master ended up getting seriously wounded. If we go, there might be nothing left of us,” Lin Shaokun said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Like I said, we might come across immortal serendipity.” Jian Xiaotian laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I will definitely go to Pot Mountain, but not now. We still haven’t shaken off our pursuers. I do not wish to bring this danger to my friends,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. By the way, there is a small city up ahead. Should we circle around it?” Jian Xiaotian said, peering ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I think we should circle around,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I agree.” Lin Shaokun nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For the next three days, the three of them spent most of their time traversing through mountains and forests. Those were all small mountains and valleys. It was not an issue for ordinary humans to hide themselves there. However, it would be difficult for them to hide there. Cultivators with a few Lightning Tribulations under their belts could scan the mountains and valleys quickly with their divine senses.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is a distance of 50,000 kilometres between here and the largest mountain range available. We cannot openly fly using flying swords. I think we should pretend to be ordinary humans and hide in some small cities,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s strange. Since leaving Extreme Celestial Sect, I keep getting this feeling that there is a danger enveloping us. And yet, no pursuers have appeared so far. What is going on here?” Chen Feng said, frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We have not approached any cities along the way. Even when we encounter some cultivators, we would take the initiative to avoid them. It is probably not easy for Nine Firmaments Palace and Extreme Celestial Sect to find us,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It would still be better for us to not be careless. These sects are very powerful. At any rate, we are still within Extreme Celestial Sect’s territory. Truth be told, I am not worried about the pursuers. I am more worried about my master.” Chen Feng sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Sage Enigma Flame was very powerful, he had yet to cultivate up to the Human Immortal stage, after all. Additionally, there was no telling how many formidable characters he was up against. In order to allow Chen Feng’s team of three to escape, Sage Enigma Flame had stepped forward to block off the other cultivators. It was unknown just what had happened to him in the end. Chen Feng would feel terribly guilty if something were to happen to Sage Enigma Flame.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry, Brother Chen. No matter what, Senior Enigma Flame is still a high-ranking figure within Extreme Celestial Sect. Extreme Celestial Sect will not take any reckless actions against him,” Jian Xiaotian comforted Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I hope so.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three of them covered several thousand more li. Finally, they could not stop themselves and they decided to enter a small city. It was only slightly larger than Black Origin City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Before entering the city, they used their soul power to swiftly scan it. After discovering that the strongest amongst the cultivators within the city was only at the Concealed stage, the three of them grew at ease.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They rested in the city for about half a day before quickly leaving again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Everything was normal and the three of them did not manage to obtain any useful information.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, not long after leaving the small city, they sensed a formidable killing intent coming from the distance. The killing intent seemingly pierced through the sky as it charged towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! They have finally caught up to us!” Chen Feng’s face grew grim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder, is it Extreme Celestial Sect or Nine Firmaments Palace?” Jian Xiaotian whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team did not choose to stay and fight. Instead, they quickly leapt into the sky and swiftly flew far away. At any rate, their position was already exposed. Continuing to hide was pointless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After flying for 1,500 kilometres, they were obstructed by three fellows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Who are you guys?” Chen Feng shouted. From what Chen Feng could sense, those three were neither from Extreme Celestial Sect nor Nine Firmaments Palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack!” The three cultivators were not weak. Every single one of them was at level 3 of the Sky Human stage. After obstructing Chen Feng’s team, they said nothing and immediately attacked. Seeing that surprised Chen Feng’s team.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!” Chen Feng decided not to get entangled with them. He directly brought out the Demon Sealing Sword. He activated the sword’s sealing power, sending it out to envelop the three cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun swiftly killed off one of them with a staff blow. Jian Xiaotian, too, killed another cultivator with a sword strike. The final cultivator was then beaten up until he was in a half-dead state and captured.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Too weak. They must be loose cultivators,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Loose cultivators? Why would loose cultivators want to attack us?” Jian Xiaotian felt puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me have a look.” After saying that, Chen Feng utilized the Demonic Heavengorging Art to utterly devour the soul power within the cultivator’s sea of wisdom. Next, he quickly went through anything useful within the devoured soul power.</span></p>
