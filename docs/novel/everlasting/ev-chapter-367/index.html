 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng ignored Tower’s complaints. Instead, he focused on experiencing the various mysteries within the Longevity Sword Technique. After displaying the Longevity Sword Technique, Chen Feng was able to alleviate his disadvantageous position somewhat. However, he was still incapable of catching Liu Feifei’s movements. Thus, he could not completely block her attacks. Even so, he was in a better position compared to earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like Chen Feng is really going to lose this match. I didn’t think Liu Feifei is so strong!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not necessarily. Chen Feng is Sage Enigma Flame’s apprentice. He must have some powerful cards up his sleeve.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What powerful cards can he have? He has already brought out his Sacred artefact. And yet, he is still no match for Liu Feifei. He is definitely going to lose this match.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is just a temporary situation!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng and Liu Feifei were fighting fiercely in the arena, some of the spectators began arguing. Some people thought highly of Chen Feng, but more thought highly of Liu Feifei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen’s situation appears unfavourable,” Luo Kong said, furrowing his brows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In everyone’s opinion, Chen Feng’s trump card was his Sacred artefact. At that moment, Chen Feng had already brought out his Sacred artefact, but he was still in a disadvantageous position. Forget the other cultivators, even Luo Kong’s gang thought so.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As expected of a great sect. They have plenty of talents. This woman is really strong.” Lin Shaokun, who had been keeping silent all this time, suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha!” Hearing Lin Shaokun’s words, Jian Xiaotian and the others laughed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although this female cultivator is strong, I still believe that Brother Chen can win,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why do you say that?” Luo Kong and the others asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A feeling.” Jian Xiaotian then laughed again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Feifei’s movements were becoming increasingly peculiar while her movement speed kept increasing. Liu Feifei’s figures filled the area around Chen Feng. It was unknown which one of those figures was the real Liu Feifei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was only passively defending himself, relying solely on his feelings to fight against Liu Feifei. During their confrontation, three more wounds had appeared on Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Freedom Movement Technique, Nine Cycles Phantom Movement Technique. Those two were peerless techniques within Extreme Celestial Sect. Those were not the techniques that any cultivators could practice. Even core disciples would need a high number of contribution points if they wanted to practice those techniques.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, the two movement techniques were quite similar. However, Chi Lianfeng was not as proficient in his movement technique compared to Liu Feifei. If it were not for that, Chen Feng would not have been able to defeat Chi Lianfeng so easily back then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Liu Feifei’s ghost-like attacks, Chen Feng could truly feel how slow he was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Snatching chestnuts from the fire!” Suddenly, Chen Feng allowed himself to be struck. In return, he stabbed at Liu Feifei. His stab appeared normal, not particularly fast and without any special powers behind it. However, Liu Feifei swiftly backed away and all the other images of her disappeared.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What kind of sword technique is that?” Liu Feifei looked at Chen Feng, a look of shock in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Sister Liu is truly an outstanding disciple from the Liu Family. Not only is your movement technique unpredictable, your swordsmanship is also incomparable,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? You are addressing me as Junior Sister? Do you think you can win?” Liu Feifei replied with an ambiguous smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since you are addressing me as Senior Brother, I will have to address you as Junior Sister. Besides, I will definitely win this match.” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? You are so confident?” Liu Feifei asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Feifei considered for a moment before saying, “How about this? Let’s make a bet.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A bet? What kind of bet?” Chen Feng grew curious. He did not understand what Liu Feifei was up to.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s simple. If you lose, join our Liu Family. How about it?” Liu Feifei said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Join your Liu Family?” An odd look appeared on Chen Feng’s face. Unexpectedly, Liu Feifei was trying to recruit him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. You will not be disadvantaged by joining our Liu Family. At any rate, we possess quite some strength within the sect. Additionally, we also have a Human Immortal. After you join our Liu Family, you can obtain better cultivation conditions and resources. Besides, didn’t you offend the Zhao Family? Although you have Sage Enigma Flame as your backer, the Zhao Family has plenty of easily-offended characters. They will definitely try to trouble you in the future,” Liu Feifei was quick to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean to say, if I join your Liu Family, the Zhao Family wouldn’t dare bother me again?” Chen Feng asked, a grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Joining our Liu Family will only bring you benefits. Surely, you will not refuse,” Liu Feifei replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! And what if you lose?” Chen Feng chuckled and changed the topic of discussion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If I lose, I will give you a Sky-tier medicinal pill,” Liu Feifei said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sky-tier medicinal pill? Tsk, tsk. Junior Sister Liu, you are very generous. Judging from your offer, be it a win or a loss, I will not be losing out in the end, is that right?” Chen Feng chortled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. How about it? Do you agree? If you do, then make your move,” Liu Feifei said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine. Let me experience your true power.” Chen Feng smiled, nodding his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After saying that, Chen Feng saw a flash and Liu Feifei appeared before him. At the same time, hundreds of sword silhouettes descended from the sky to form a dome, entrapping Chen Feng within.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>She’s even faster now</span></em><span>. Chen Feng was shocked and the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand furiously created a barrier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A lightning bolt seemingly descended, giving Chen Feng a bout of dizziness. The barrier around him was shattered as the overpowering impact caused Chen Feng to stagger, seemingly on the brink of falling down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Like agile snakes, streams of formidable sword energy coursed through Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng! Weng! Weng! Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The body armour that Chen Feng was wearing immediately activated. The powers of ice and fire circulated in an attempt to stop the streams of sword energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of grating sounds rang out and Chen Feng’s body armour was completely revealed. Sword marks could be seen all over its surface as Chen Feng sensed countless streams of sword energy making their way into his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After making their way into his body, the streams of sword energy began rampaging about wildly. In but less than half a breath’s worth of time, Chen Feng could already feel several hundred parts of his body getting damaged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heavengulping Absorption Technique!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shouted inwardly and the insight acupoints he had opened up immediately exerted potent suction forces to completely devour all the sword energy within his body in a flash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? They were all refined?” Liu Feifei was even more stunned. She was capable of sensing each stream of sword energy. At that very moment, however, she could clearly sense that Chen Feng had refined all the energy streams.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eight wilderness and six accords! Rampage!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng continued brandishing the Demon Sealing Sword while displaying a move from the Longevity Blade Technique. Blade beams erupted with an incomparable atmosphere of tyranny and an unstoppable momentum soared out from Chen Feng’s body. Chen Feng could sense it. Not only was his combat prowess rising, a desire to annihilate everything had appeared within his heart. It was as though he was capable of charging wantonly through the cosmos, an invincible existence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Deng! Deng! Deng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the atmosphere radiating from Chen Feng’s body, Liu Feifei felt shocked and she reflexively took several steps back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua! Shua! Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword light flashed out from Chen Feng’s sword. Next, the atmosphere he radiated rose even further, rising without respite as he stirred out the power of the Demon Sealing Sword. Stream after stream of formidable powers flowed out from the blade of the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was the astral lightning power within the Demon Sealing Sword. Even Chen Feng was incapable of controlling it. Eight bolts of astral lightning shot out, but only two of them shot towards Liu Feifei while the other six streaked about around the arena.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A booming sound rang out and the barrier set up around the arena suddenly burst apart. The formidable power continued to streak outwards and the nearby cultivators were immediately forced to jumped up and down in a wretched manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry! Put up the barrier!” The faces of the supervising elders outside the arena sank and they furiously shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Instantly, eight supervising elders rushed forward to occupy eight different positions. Beams of light shone out from their hands and a new layer of barrier was quickly set up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible! The barrier for the competition arena was set up by a Human Immortal. Unexpectedly, they managed to break it. This fight is quite exciting. Looks like our positions might be threatened,” a cultivator in white clothes said with a smile as he hovered up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! They are just relying on the power of their magic treasures. They are not worth getting concerned over. What is it, Ming Tianfeng? Are you feeling scared?” A dashing-looking cultivator in blue clothes was hovering beside the cultivator in white.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of them was Jian Kongming while the other was Ming Tianfeng. They were both the best of the best amongst the younger generation of Extreme Celestial Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Me, scared? Are you joking? In my eyes, there is only one opponent worth my while in this competition. And that opponent is you, Jian Kongming!” Ming Tianfeng said arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you not think anything of Zhao Yizhan and the others?” There was a smile on Jian Kongming’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are just waiting to be defeated. Extreme Celestial Hall and the other major groups were careless. They did not send out their true powerhouses for this competition,” Ming Tianfeng said, shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You can’t say that. We are the ones who are bullying others here.” Jian Kongming chuckled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, we are the bullies here. It has been a long time since we are able to have a good fight. This time, you better go all out,” Ming Tianfeng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If I go all out, you will never get the Heart of Seven Apertures,” Jian Kongming said with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! You think I care about that? The reason I decided to participate in this Grand Competition is because I wanted to see if there are any experts participating. Unexpectedly, this result is too disappointing,” Ming Tianfeng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, considering your wealth, you have no need to care about the rewards. In that case, I will take the Heart of Seven Apertures and exchange it for something good.” Jian Kongming nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t brag. You might lose to me this time. Besides, if you need anything, just come find me. Why participate in something so pointless?” Ming Tianfeng seemed displeased.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Many of the Extreme Celestial Sect disciples did not know, but these two highly arrogant core disciples were good friends.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Of the two bolts of astral lightning shooting towards Liu Feifei, one was shattered by Liu Feifei’s sword swing while the other one struck her, sending her and her sword flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was planning to execute a follow-up attack, Liu Feifei’s figure suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>She disappeared into the void. This is the true Void Sword Technique!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought as he vigilantly assessed his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A chilling glint of light suddenly pierced out from the void above Chen Feng’s head, not making a single sound as it did. Next, Liu Feifei – wielding her Sacred-tier sword – appeared above Chen Feng. Sword beams shot out to once again surround Chen Feng.</span></p>
