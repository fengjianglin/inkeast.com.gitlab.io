 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful, someone is coming up.” By then, the two descending cultivators had already noticed Chen Feng as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As neither side were moving slowly, it took merely two breaths’ worth of time before they encountered one another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid! What did you find under this lake? &nbsp;Hurry up and hand it over!” Seeing that Chen Feng was a young cultivator, hints of killing intent promptly appeared within the two cultivators’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Did you two damage your head somewhere?” Chen Feng replied with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a death wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators grew furious and they simultaneously attacked Chen Feng. Two beams of light sliced through the lake’s waters at they stabbed towards Chen Feng, one from the left and one from the right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Quite the ruthless attack.” Chen Feng sneered. He did not do anything to fight back. As expected, before the two sword beams could reach Chen Feng’s body, the halo of light radiated by the Longevity Tower blocked them. The sword beams shattered and the fragments shot back at the two cultivators, leaving wounds on their bodies instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What?” The two cultivators were stunned. Next, they looked at the nine-level pagoda tower in Chen Feng’s hand and a fiery look appeared on their faces. Even a fool would be able to see that the nine-level pagoda tower was an extraordinary item.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, hurry up and hand over the tower in your hand. That way, you will be able to preserve your life!” one of the two cultivators bellowed. However, he did not attack Chen Feng again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Moron!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng scoffed and ignored the two cultivators. He rapidly increased the rate at which he was moving upwards, smashing the two fellows aside before continuing his assent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chase him!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Exchanging glances, the two cultivators then moved to pursue Chen Feng. However, an undercurrent suddenly surged towards the two of them. Two colossal water monsters had targeted the two cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Humph! Have fun playing with the water monsters under the lake.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng snickered to himself as he continued to charge upwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After breaking out from under the lake, Chen Feng was not even given the time to get his bearings when a net – shining with golden light – wrapped around him. At the same time, two ropes, filled with sharp hooks, shot out from left and right to bind his arms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower emanated an invisible ripple and the net and ropes were broken apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oomph!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three cultivators backed away and they cast looks of dread at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why did you fellows attack me?” Chen Feng asked, a ferocious grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, why exchange nonsensical words with them? Just kill them,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t just kill people all the time. If I do that, what is the difference between me and a demon?” Chen Feng retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What about demons? Even demons can cultivate the peerless dao,” Tower said disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivator holding the geomantic compass stared at Chen Feng and asked, “Where are the other two fellows?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, you fellows are after some other people. However, why did you attack me for no reason? If you fellows cannot give me a reasonable answer, you fellows will die,” Chen Feng said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, cut the bullshit. Did you find a meteorite under this lake?” another cultivator who was wielding a flaming blade moved forward and shouted</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows did not answer my question. So, you have chosen death.” After saying that, Chen Feng shook the Longevity Tower slightly. The Longevity Tower’s spire immediately fired out three faint-yellow streams of light to accurately strike the three cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After getting struck by the faint-yellow beams, the three cultivators could not even put up a fight before their bodies were paralyzed and they drifted down to float upon the surface of the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the Myriad Induction Geocompass, which was within the grasp of one of the cultivators, flew into his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three cultivators were extremely shocked. They wanted to get up, but found that there was an invisible force restraining their bodies, making it impossible for them to move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng moved to hover before the cultivator and asked, “What is this thing?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!” The cultivator merely grunted, ignoring Chen Feng’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! In that case, I will have to use a simpler method.” After saying that, Chen Feng sent his soul power into the Myriad Induction Geocompass. A series of popping sounds rang out as the soul imprint left inside it was utterly cleared away. Next, Chen Feng placed his own soul imprint inside it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pu!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the soul imprint within the Myriad Induction Geocompass was cleared away, the cultivator instantly sprayed blood out from his mouth. His face was pale and the essence, energy and soul within his body withered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, this magic treasure is known as the Myriad Induction Geocompass. It is capable of scanning for meteorites. It can even scan for underground mines. It also has tracking and offensive capabilities. This is a good magic treasure,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, with a thought from Chen Feng, the pointer on the Myriad Induction Geocompass transformed into a stream of light and flew out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It pierced the head of a water monster within the lake before flying back to the geomantic compass.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not bad. It is even faster than flying swords and can kill without a trace. It is a good item. I will be keeping this,” Chen Feng said, keeping the Myriad Induction Geocompass into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!” Seeing Chen Feng snatch away his magic treasure, the cultivator was enraged to the point of nearly puking blood. However, he was powerless to do anything about it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the surface of the lake exploded and the two cultivators who entered the lake earlier flew out, looking wretched as they did so. Two savage water monsters were quick to charge out from the lake as well. The two water monsters looked like mutated pythons. They had long bodies that were covered with sharp scales. Sharp spikes grew upon their large heads. When they opened their mouths, a tongue – ten plus metres in length – swirled towards the two cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These two fellows are quite skilled. They could actually make it out.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After breaking out from the lake, the two cultivators had wanted to flee. However, the two water monsters were quick to entangle them up, leading to another battle between the two sides.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators were already wounded back when they were under the lake. Thus, they could not hold on for long. Blood kept trickling out from their bodies and their auras gradually grew weaker. The two cultivators were about to become food for the two water monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng finally took action. Two suction forces emerged from the Longevity Tower to suck in the two water monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng collected all the storage gears on the five cultivators. After a quick inspection, he shook his head. “Only some spiritual herbs and ores. They don’t even have a decent number of spirit stones on them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing Chen Feng’s words, the five cultivators felt their minds reeling. Truth be told, they possessed a considerable number of items on them. They could already be considered relatively wealthy amongst those on the same level as them. However, in the face of a rich guy like Chen Feng, they were just poor fellows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Still, better than nothing. I’ll take it.” Chen Feng put all the items into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellow friend, you have already taken away everything we have. Can you spare our lives?” the former owner of the Myriad Induction Geocompass asked with a concerned tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why would I kill you fellows? If you fellows did not attack me in the first place, I would not have bothered doing anything to you. You only have yourselves to blame for being greedy. If you don’t have the ability, don’t recklessly offend others. Since I am in a good mood today, I will let you fellows off.” After saying that, Chen Feng did not bother waiting for their answer before leaving the place. Astral energy shielded his body and it did not take long for Chen Feng to cover a distance of over 50 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! How unfortunate.” Watching Chen Feng’s departure, the cultivators sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Finding a meteorite has not been easy. I originally thought that we would be making a fortune. Unexpectedly, we ended up encountering something like this. Even our savings are gone. Right now, we are left with nothing at all. It will be difficult for us to even heal up. I think we should leave Starsea Region after we recover!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I agree. Before coming here, I had thought that this is a paradise for adventurers. Only now do I know; even Sky Human stage cultivators could easily die here. This is not a safe place at all!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough! Be content, you fellows. The fact that we can preserve our lives this time around is already a good thing. Luckily, the other fellow is not a killer. The way I see it, we should leave this place and find somewhere to heal up first. There might be other water monsters here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“By the way, did you fellows notice? That youngster looks like the criminal that Nine Firmaments Palace is after!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean Chen Feng from Extreme Celestial Sect? Hmm, yes. They do look similar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I think it is most likely Chen Feng. What should we do now? Do we go notify the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace? This Starsea Region has a good number of disciples from Nine Firmaments Palace.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Forget it. Let’s not get involved with this matter. Even if that person is Chen Feng, we’ll just pretend we don’t know about it. You’ve already seen it earlier. For that fellow, killing us is just a matter of lifting a hand!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ignoring whether or not those cultivators would report his whereabouts, Chen Feng had already flown far away. As Chen Feng was flying forward, he sensed several formidable soul powers scanning around. Chen Feng figured that those fellows must have been lured over due to the actions he took back at Skycloud Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, that’s a Myriad Induction Geocompass you’re holding.” By then, Jian Xiaotian had already emerged from the Longevity Tower. His wounds were already completely healed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Brother Jian, you know of this item?” Chen Feng replied smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have seen it before. It is a magic treasure used for finding items. Some trade associations and auction houses would sell this magic treasure and many adventurers would carry this with them. Generally, though, the grades of those magic treasures are low. It is rare to see such a high-grade one,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a grade 4 Prized artefact. Speaking of which, this is one of the biggest gains I got this time,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had already refined the Thousand Seeker Mirror, which possessed a tracking function. However, when compared to this Myriad Induction Geocompass, the Thousand Seeker Mirror was clearly far inferior.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were chatting, the pointer on the Myriad Induction Geocompass, held in Chen Feng’s hand, suddenly spun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? There is something!” Chen Feng injected his soul power into it. After spinning a few times, the pointer then pointed at a certain direction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The pointer is pointing south. Could there be a large meteorite there?” said a shocked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll find out once we get there.” Jian Xiaotian grew interested as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No rush. I’ll do a more thorough scan first,” Chen Feng said and he closed both his eyes. Like a storm, his soul power roared as he empowered the Myriad Induction Geocompass.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After one joss stick’s worth of time, Chen Feng opened his eyes. “I have only just refined this magic treasure, so I am not too familiar with it just yet. However, according to the geomantic compass and my calculations, there is definitely a treasure somewhere far ahead. Even if it’s not a large meteorite, it must at least be a sizable spirit stone mine!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is a treasure? We cannot miss out on this. At any rate, the Starsea Region is an incomparably chaotic place. There is no need to fear even if our identities get exposed,” Jian Xiaotian was quick to say.</span></p>
