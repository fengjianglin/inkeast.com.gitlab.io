 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful-” The white-clad cultivator knew just how powerful the lightning power was and he quickly tried to warn the black-clad cultivator. However, the black-clad cultivator had already sent his own palm forward to meet Chen Feng’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black-clad cultivator’s palm burst apart as the flesh on his hand was torn, blackened by the clash. All of that was caused by the tribulation lightning that Chen Feng unleashed. Seeing such a display of might, Chen Feng felt satisfied. All those bitter days spent tempering himself were paying off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The white-clad cultivator quickly rushed forward to perform a stabbing attack at Chen Feng, wanting to save his wounded companion. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng chose to ignore his attack to instead rush forward to land a heavy palm strike upon the black-clad cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a booming sound, the black-clad cultivator’s chest exploded, becoming charred as a result. His figure fell and he could no longer get up. As for Chen Feng, he endured the attack to his back. Due to the attack, a shallow wound appeared on his back. His muscles twitched a few times and the wound completely healed up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are the only one left.” Chen Feng turned and smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The white-clad cultivator’s face sank and his whole figure disappeared. Next, he re-appeared beside the black-clad cultivator. He grabbed the black-clad cultivator and the two of them disappeared. He wanted to leave. However, Chen Feng swung to send his sword flying out. With a swooshing sound, the white-clad cultivator’s arm was severed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even so, they managed to escape in the end. It was because Chen Feng did not choose to pursue them. By using his Sacred artefacts, he could have easily killed them off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Judging by their way of conduct, they must be from Killer Palace. Just two level 6 Sky Human stage cultivators are this powerful. If they were to send out Human Immortals, wouldn’t they be able to kill me with a sneak attack?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Considering that, Chen Feng felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The Killer Palace is highly mysterious and its overall strength is in no way inferior to the great sects. Additionally, they possess a better array of means compared to the great sects. It will be problematic for me if this organization targets me. However, in order to employ the Killer Palace’s services, one must pay a high price. I do not believe that Nine Firmaments Palace will employ that many assassins.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Come to think about it, facing assassins of this level will be a form of training for me, no?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Chen Feng suddenly exclaimed. He brought out a piece of jade talisman. After using it to scan around for a while, he said, “Brother Jian is nearby.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng leapt into the sky to rush towards Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that very moment, Jian Xiaotian was in a very rough spot. Jian Xiaotian, Liu Wenlong and two other disciples from Heavenly Sword Faction were tightly besieged by a group of cultivators. Judging by their situation, it would not take long for the besieging cultivators to kill off Jian Xiaotian’s group.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Aren’t you fellows from Heavenly Sword Faction always the arrogant, unbridled sort who view others as nobodies? And yet, you fellows are going to die to us today!” A cultivator who was standing outside the encirclement laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Unexpectedly, you fellows from Heartless Heaven Sect would be supporting the bandits of the Twospan Mountain Range. If news of this were to spread, how will your Heartless Heaven Sect manage?” Liu Wenlong shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! What a joke! Is your Heavenly Sword Faction any better? Don’t think I do not know why you fellows came here. Your Heavenly Sword Faction have been secretly nurturing an army here. We have long since gotten wind of this matter. Forget you fellows, even the army you’ve hidden here can forget about leaving.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian’s group of four instantly realized that things were not looking good for them. At that moment, all they could do was to charge out and have one of them get reinforcements from the sect. Failing to do so would mean that their army in the Twospan Mountain Range would all be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Send more men. Kill them. That way, we can avoid any future issues.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another three cultivators joined the fight and the pressure on Jian Xiaotian’s group further increased. Although the cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction were formidable, they were gradually losing ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“After killing these four, we’ll head to the hidden site of the Heavenly Sword Faction. I want to see what they have hidden there.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A young cultivator from Heartless Heaven Sect said with a derisive smile. The ones around him were all infamous bandits and loose cultivators from the Twospan Mountain Range. They were the secret agents that Heartless Heaven Sect had scattered around the Twospan Mountain Range over the years.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Chen Feng had already arrived. He stayed hidden within the void somewhere close as he inspected his surroundings. Although Jian Xiaotian’s group was in danger, Chen Feng did not rush forward. He activated his Magic Eyes of Darkness and both his eyes turned black as he attempted to get a clear view of his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>As expected, there is a Human Immortal hiding in the dark. Looks like he is planning on luring me out. If this Human Immortal had taken action, their side could have easily finished off Jian Xiaotian and the others,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the beginning, Chen Feng had wanted to utilize the power of darkness to hide himself and execute a sneak attack. However, after discovering the Human Immortal, Chen Feng changed his mind. After a moment’s consideration, Chen Feng began setting up magic arrays. One by one, Chen Feng brought out crystals of varying attributes from the Longevity Tower. He quickly engraved runes on the crystals. Even some of the metal puppets within the Longevity Tower moved to help him out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon enough, Chen Feng had set up three magic arrays. He set up two magic arrays around them while carrying the third one with him. He had learned how to set up these magic arrays by studying the magic arrays on the second floor of the Longevity Tower. Naturally, he was incapable of replicating the magic arrays completely. Every one of the magic arrays within the Longevity Tower was incomparably powerful. A complete version of just one of the magic arrays could obliterate every one of the cultivators there, even the Human Immortal who was hiding in the dark.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An attack sent Jian Xiaotian flying and he fell into a group of cultivators. Immediately, various attacks shot towards Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Xiaotian!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The other three shouted loudly. Although Jian Xiaotian’s cultivation base was not as strong as them, his potential was far greater. Additionally, Jian Xiaotian also possessed the Absolute Combat Constitution. He was someone that Heavenly Sword Faction would want to spend a great deal of efforts nurturing. While their deaths could be considered acceptable, Jian Xiaotian’s death would translate to a huge loss for their sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was then that Chen Feng took action. He started off by unleashing his strongest move, the Storm of Sword Beams and the cultivators surrounding Jian Xiaotian were blown away, shredded into a mist of blood. Despite that, the Storm of Sword Beams did not subside. Instead, it continued to spread into its surroundings and cultivators were instantly killed in its wake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Phew!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the powerful aura, Jian Xiaotian breathed a sigh of relief. Knowing that Chen Feng had arrived, he quickly got up and immediately started focusing on healing himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’re finally here. I want to see how you plan on escaping.” The Human Immortal who was hiding in the dark made ready to step forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng displayed the Longevity Sword Technique to carve a bloody path forward and many of the cultivators there were killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, how are you holding up?” Chen Feng asked smilingly. He waved his hand to send a stream of longevity-type primary energy into Jian Xiaotian’s body, allowing Jian Xiaotian’s body to recover at an even faster rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That was close. If you had appeared any later, I would have died.” Jian Xiaotian laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you have a death wish!” An astral sword, tens of zhang in length, descended upon Chen Feng. This was an attack by a very powerful Sky Human stage cultivator. This astral sword attack by him was aimed at instantly killing Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!” Chen Feng swung his hand, firing out an extremely concentrated sword beam which shattered the astral sword. The sword beam tore a hole through the attacker and his body violently exploded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellow cultivator, thank you for the assistance!” Liu Wenlong was quick to express his gratitude.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No need to be so courteous. He is an honorary elder of our Heavenly Sword Faction,” said Jian Xiaotian, who laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Wenlong and the other two were surprised to hear that. However, they were quick to understand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right, let’s not talk too much now. We should charge out first.” Chen Feng waved his hand. He could see that Liu Wenlong and the others were not in a good condition. They had suffered from grievous injuries and were practically only holding on through sheer will. Without that, they would have fallen long ago.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You want to leave? Not so fast!” The surrounding cultivators bellowed and they rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows still do not have what it takes to stop us,” Chen Feng said as he rapidly activated the magic arrays that he had set up beforehand. Sharp wailing sounds rang out, dark clouds descended, strong winds rose up all around them and sword beams rampaged about. Immediately, another tens of cultivators were killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Insolence!” The Great Manager of Blackwind Stronghold, who had been hiding in the dark, was finally incapable of holding back. With one step, he appeared before Chen Feng. Then, he stretched his hand out to catch Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ve been waiting for you.” Chen Feng swung his hand and the third magic array was unleashed. One crystal after another swirled about in the air to surround the Great Manager and various attacks inundated him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!” Chen Feng swung his hand again and Jian Xiaotian and the others fell onto the Sword of Life, which transformed into a sword beam as it charged out from the encirclement. In just one breath, they were already tens of li away from the cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A Sacred artefact!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Wenlong and the others exchanged glances. They had not expected this honorary elder of theirs who had appeared so suddenly to be so powerful. Not to mention, he also possessed such a formidable magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Did you actually manage to kill off the Human Immortal?” Jian Xiaotian asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No way. That move will only occupy him for a moment. He will be able to break free very quickly.” Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After just a moment, they had covered a distance of several thousand li. Chen Feng then landed the sword and set up a layer of barrier. After that, Jian Xiaotian and the others began working on their recovery.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian was the first to recover after just a while. Then, both Jian Xiaotian and Chen Feng began talking about what happened to the both of them after Chen Feng entered the crack back then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was surprised. He did not think that Jian Xiaotian would manage to gain something from the place as well. He had actually found and absorbed some pure power within the crack, allowing him to overcome Lightning Tribulation again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How did you end up getting besieged?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s the Heartless Heaven Sect. Our sect and Heartless Heaven Sect have always been at odds. We are now at war with each other again. Our sect and Heartless Heaven Sect have a hidden force here in the Twospan Mountain Range. This is just one of the conflicts between our sect and them. However, I do not understand why Blackwind Stronghold would interfere.” Jian Xiaotian shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was quick to understand. “It’s because of me. I had raided two of Blackwind Stronghold’s outposts.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng informed Jian Xiaotian about his actions of raiding Blackwind Stronghold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is not your fault. At any rate, the two of us had been together in the beginning. However, your actions of raiding their outposts is a good thing. Our Heavenly Sword Faction have long since wanted to take action against these bandit nests,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
