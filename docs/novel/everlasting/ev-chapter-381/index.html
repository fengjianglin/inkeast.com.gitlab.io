 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is Pot Mountain!” Jian Xiaotian suddenly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After emerging from the Skysoar Shuttle, they found no pursuers around. Thus, they began investigating their location. After spending some time on it, they suddenly realized that they were actually within the vicinity of Pot Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Surely not? So coincidental?” Chen Feng was surprised. He did not think that the Skysoar Shuttle would have brought them here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian simultaneously turned to look at Lin Shaokun. At any rate, Lin Shaokun had been the one controlling the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Don’t look at me like that. I had randomly picked a direction back then. Who could have guessed that we would end up here?” Lin Shaokun said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng considered for a moment before saying, “Very well. Since we are already here, I might as well go check up on my friends while I am here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe we’ll come across immortal serendipity,” Jian Xiaotian said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As if it would be that easy.” Lin Shaokun shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pot Mountain was not a particularly large place. Additionally, only a small number of cultivators knew that Pot Mountain was an ancient immortal mountain. Naturally, those people who knew had either secretly or openly come here before. However, they were all incapable of finding anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The five Pot Brothers had been residing in Pot Mountain for decades, so much so that they ended up with the nickname Five Heroes of Pot Mountain. Unfortunately for them, they were incapable of finding anything good at all. In the end, they simply treated Pot Mountain as a cultivation ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, many of the cultivators who knew that Pot Mountain was an ancient immortal mountain ended up determining that it was simply a rumour after failing to find anything. Finally, they lost interest in Pot Mountain. As time went by, the number of people who knew about this grew even scarcer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team of three circled the peripheral area of Pot Mountain. As expected, they encountered some cultivators. However, they were all ordinary cultivators. Not a single one of them had overcome Lightning Tribulation before. Chen Feng’s team, who were secretly observing the cultivators, knew that these cultivators were not pursuing them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Boss, this place is Pot Mountain. We are already here. Why don’t we see the Pot Brothers?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Did they flee?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That should not be the case. Although the Pot Brothers do not possess high cultivation bases, they are very strong-willed. Since they have agreed to a duel today, they will not flee.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right, let’s not talk anymore. Since we are already here, let’s just enter Pot Mountain and check it out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The group consisted of six people. All of them were cultivators in the Concealed stage. After listening in to their conversation, Chen Feng was able to surmise what was happening.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like these fellows are here to trouble your friends. Should we take action and get rid of them?” Jian Xiaotian whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No hurry. Let’s follow them first,” Chen Feng replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng’s team possessed a much higher cultivation base compared to the six cultivators, they could follow them from a distance without being detected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take the six cultivators long to find the Pot Brothers’ place of residence. There was a total of five artificially-dug caves. The entrances were wide and the walls were smooth and flat. Some patterns were engraved into the walls. Beside the entrances were doors made from stones. Clearly, these were not ordinary caves. Rather, this place had been carefully crafted by the Pot Brothers. The Pot Brothers had been living here for decades, after all. This place was practically like their lair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The five caves were facing a small and clean valley. The flowers, grasses, trees and vegetation within the valley had been meticulously tended to. There was also a small river flowing through the valley and a pavilion amidst a garden of flowers. It almost looked like paradise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Pot Brothers sure know how to enjoy themselves. The environment here is quite good. The amount of spiritual energy here is also acceptable. It is a good place for cultivation,” one of the cultivators said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Boss, if you like it, let’s just take it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is strange. It looks like there is nobody here at all. Could this be a trap?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, the six cultivators cautiously entered and searched the caves. It did not take them long to come out from the caves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is really nobody here. The Pot Brothers must have run away due to fear!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Looks like this trip was in vain. It turns out the Pot Brothers are so cowardly. In that case, from this moment onwards, this place will belong to us. Everyone, go look around. There might be some items here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the six of them were looking around, Chen Feng’s team of three appeared. Seeing the sudden appearance of three cultivators shocked the six cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you people?” One of them forced himself to calm down and asked. None of them could determine how these three fellows had appeared. Thus, their hearts were all palpitating furiously as they knew that these three were not to be trifled with.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just scram,” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!” Hearing Chen Feng’s words, a look of anger appeared on the faces of all six. However, they dared not attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The strongest amongst the six cultivators was only at level 6 of the Concealed stage. He had yet to even condense out his Soulflame and was simply not worthy of being noticed by Chen Feng’s team.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why exchange so much nonsense with them? Just kill them all,” Jian Xiaotian said as he casually released a portion of his aura.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All six became so terrified that they stepped backwards. Looks of dread appeared on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sky Human stage cultivators!” All six were terrified senseless. That aura earlier was clearly from one who had overcome Lightning Tribulation. If so, these three fellows were not characters that they could offend.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One breath. If you do not get out of our sights by then, you can forget about leaving,” Lin Shaokun said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, the six cultivators grew so terrified, they immediately turned around and fled. They disappeared from the mountain in less than one breath’s worth of time, running over 50 kilometres before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! That was too dangerous! To think that those fellows are Sky Human stage experts. It would have been easy for them to kill us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Boss, did the Pot Brothers get them to come?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Probably not. If the Pot Brothers possess such a backing, they would not have run away. Forget it. Since there is no sign of the Pot Brothers, our objective has also been met. Let’s just hurry back!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right, right! It would be bad if those three fellows chase after us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a brief discussion, the six cultivators left.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Strange, there is no one here. Did your friends leave?” Jian Xiaotian said with a puzzled tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is a little strange. Let’s split up and search.” As Chen Feng spoke, he released his soul power to begin scanning Pot Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take them long to search through Pot Mountain. In the end, however, they found nothing special.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, Jian Xiaotian called out, “Brother Chen, I found a stone stele.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A stone stele?” Chen Feng’s heart skipped a beat and he swiftly arrived before Jian Xiaotian. Lin Shaokun arrived at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was a very ordinary-looking stone stele. One zhang tall and one metre wide. It stood firmly somewhere halfway up the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There are no words on it</span></em><span>. Chen Feng circled the stone stele. He recalled what the Pot Brothers had said to him back then. According to them, there should be words on the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Is it not this one?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng grew doubtful. However, he quickly tossed away that thought. This stone stele was the only thing they had found after searching through the whole mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It looks like an ordinary stone stele. There is nothing extraordinary about it,” Jian Xiaotian said, stepping forward to feel the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, too, sent out his soul power to scan the stone stele. In the end, however, Chen Feng was disappointed to find that this was indeed just an ordinary piece of stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How strange.” Chen Feng kept circling around the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is strange about it? Maybe the mystery lies beneath this stone stele,” Jian Xiaotian said, reaching out with his palm to grab the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Jian Xiaotian became surprised. He had failed to budge the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even if the stone stele had a weight of over 5,000 kilogrammes, Jian Xiaotian should have been able to casually lift it up. And yet, this stone stele had remained immobile in the face of Jian Xiaotian’s might.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Something is not right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Both Chen Feng and Lin Shaokun stared with widened eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me try again!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After saying that, Jian Xiaotian stepped forward and stretched out both his hands to encircle and grab the stone stele. Streams of primary energy surged within Jian Xiaotian’s body and astral energy flowed out to envelop his whole body. Even so, no matter how hard Jian Xiaotian tried, he was unable to move the stone stele in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Jian Xiaotian let go and shook his head. “Something is strange. This stone stele feels like a mountain!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not step forward. Instead, he stretched his palm out. Streams of primary energy surged and a palm silhouette – formed with the power of the five elements – appeared in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the palm silhouette flew forward to grab a thick giant tree that was 100 metres away. Next, the giant tree was easily uprooted by the palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, the palm silhouette swiftly moved to grab the stone stele. The power inside Chen Feng’s body surged and the palm silhouette became more tangible. It appeared like a hand of god, one capable of ripping up an entire mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, no matter how hard Chen Feng channelled his magic power, the stone stele remained immobile, not budging in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng swung his hand and the palm silhouette slapped the ground heavily, causing dust to rise up. A huge palm print was left on the ground as a result.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This stone stele is more than meets the eye,” Chen Feng said, frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll smash it with my staff,” said Lin Shaokun, who swung his staff furiously against the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wait!” Chen Feng quickly uttered, wanting to stop him. However, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The gilded staff heavily struck the stone stele. Next, a dazzling light flashed out from the stone stele, forcing Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian to close their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although they were forced to close their eyes, they could still hear the sound of winds blowing. They knew that Lin Shaokun had been sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The light only lasted for a moment. Then, the stone stele returned to its normal state. However, Lin Shaokun was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Lin!” Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian exchanged glances, looks of shock on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them quickly found Lin Shaokun somewhere within a radius of over 100 zhang away from the stone stele. To their surprise, Lin Shaokun had been knocked unconscious and the gilded staff in his hand had disappeared. However, what had caught their attention the most were Lin Shaokun’s palms. They were torn and blood kept flowing out from them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng swiftly stepped forward to inspect Lin Shaokun’s situation and found that Lin Shaokun had only passed out. Other than that, there was nothing particularly serious about his condition.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then sent out a stream of longevity-type primary energy, which swiftly flowed around Lin Shaokun’s body. Lin Shaokun then woke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cough! Cough!” Lin Shaokun clutched his head as he got up. He appeared to be feeling somewhat dizzy still. Seeing that further stunned Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. The ability to leave a level 3 Sky Human stage cultivator in such a state without damaging his internal organs was something that only a high-level Sky Human stage cultivator could accomplish.</span></p>
