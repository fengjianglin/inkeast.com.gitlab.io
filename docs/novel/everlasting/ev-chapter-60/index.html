<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng spent the next few days stabilizing his cultivation base. In the end, he spent a whole month practicing within the valley. Only then did he decide to leave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a really good place to practice cultivation. If not for the fact that I want to go out for an adventure, I would stay here and enter cultivation retreat,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>During the past month, Chen Feng had established a link with the Longevity Tower, successfully opened up his 1<sup>st</sup> sea of wisdom layer, his Heavenly Origin acupoint and even learnt how to drive a flying sword. Additionally, his cultivation base of level 1 of the Concealed stage was practically at the major success phase. At present, Chen Feng lacked the experience that could only be gained by combating other cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The increase in strength was naturally a good thing. For Chen Feng, however, he could finally feel the path he needed to take and an objective had formed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To constantly grow stronger and discover his own identity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“According to the mysterious voice, he is the Longevity Tower and the Longevity Tower is him. What a peculiar statement. I wonder what that means.” Chen Feng pondered those words with a frowning face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Regardless, this fellow had helped me improve my cultivation base and gave me a complete version of the Longevity Scripture. He even gave me the ability to control the Longevity Tower. This should be a good thing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, ‘he’ seems to be in a terribly wounded state. Could it be that after I have grown stronger, I will have to go repair all the cracks and damage on the Longevity Tower? Surely, it won’t be as simple as that?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whatever, thinking so much about it is pointless. I should hurry up and improve my cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng shook his head and cast the issue aside. After clearing his mind, he willed himself into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By now, the Four-eared Spirit Monkey was no longer radiating an atmosphere of wildness. Even the violent aura that it had been emanating had been retracted. Instead, there was a slight look of exhaustion on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk! Tsk! You are truly a powerful yao beast. Even though you have not had anything to eat and drink for so long, you don’t appear particularly listless,” said Chen Feng, who was unable to stop himself from smiling. Next, he retrieved a fresh, pink-coloured peach the size of a bowl and tossed it over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four-eared Spirit Monkey opened its mouth, which produced a suction force, pulling the peach into its mouth. In but moments, it had swallowed the peach.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human, what do you want? If you want to kill me, then just kill me. Tying me up like this, what kind of hero are you?” the Four-eared Spirit Monkey said calmly, its eyes glinting, seemingly thinking about something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nothing much. I just want you to submit to me,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Submit to you?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing those words, the Four-eared Spirit Monkey instantly barked out loudly. It was as though it had just the funniest joke ever.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“With your current state, you have no way of making me submit to you. You want me to submit to you? Simple. Release me. As long as you can defeat me, I will submit to you. For us yao beasts, might is everything. As long as you can defeat me, you can be my boss,” the Four-eared Spirit Monkey barked out with a laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, you can continue staying here. However, I will not mistreat you. Here, this is a bottle of Fasting Pills. It will be enough to last you for quite a while.” Chen Feng tossed out a bottle of medicinal pills before leaving the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems subjugating this yao beast will not be as easy as it looks. It looks easy since all I need to do is be stronger than him. However, given my present level of strength, it is likely that I am truly no match for the monkey.” Chen Feng shook his head as a somewhat helpless feeling rose within him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, I will first consider it as raising a pet. Once I am strong enough, I will subjugate him,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Then, Chen Feng stepped on the Overwhelming Astral Sword and began driving the flying sword through the sky. Mountain peaks and the various ancient, towering trees zoomed by beneath his feet. Shifting his gaze towards the distant horizon, he observed the rolling mountains. Various flying creatures would dart in and out of his sight every now and again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His eyes could gaze a thousand li into the distance, broadening his vision and stirring his heart. Chen Feng could not stop himself from releasing a loud laugh. His mighty laughter rose up to the clouds (1 li = 0.5 km).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Chen Feng felt a harmonious feeling within his heart, his thoughts clear and his spirits lifted. As a result, his state of mind underwent a slight improvement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Driving a flying sword to cover ten thousand li in a single day while appreciating the white and ephemeral clouds, a journey through a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers. This is the dream of who knows how many men. To think that I can now attain it,” said Chen Feng in excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng quickly recollected himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He, he! I am just driving a flying sword. This is merely a way of moving around. This is just the first step on my dao of cultivation. A Concealed stage cultivator like me is probably at the lowest level compared to those in this world, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where should I go next? Hmm, let’s go deeper into Black Origin Mountain Range and explore around.” After saying that, Chen Feng sped up and his figure flew across another mountain in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It is said that there are Great Yaos and Yao Kings who can take on human forms deep within Black Origin Mountain Range. I wonder if it is true? If it is true, I will need to be very careful.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s flying speed was very fast and it did not take him long to cover several hundred li again, going even deeper into the mountain range. Occasionally, he could sense powerful auras emanating from the ground. Chen Feng knew that those auras belonged to yao beasts. One time, Chen Feng had even encountered two large birds. When the birds spread open their wings, they appeared like small mountains, capable of blocking off the sky and blotting out the sun. When they radiated their aura outwards, the various yao beasts in the forest below reined back their auras. As for Chen Feng, he had immediately plummeted to the ground to hide himself. Chen Feng estimated that one swipe from one of the birds’ wing was enough to send him flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It seems not even the sky is safe.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Thought Chen Feng dreadfully, his heart still palpitating with dread.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span><em>I never expected Black Origin Mountain Range to be this big. Given my flying speed, it will probably take me tens of days to fly through it. Not to mention, according to the book, within the Northern Plains, this Black Origin Mountain Range is merely a place that is not worth mentioning.</em> There was shock in Chen Feng’s heart. After that, though, he flew back up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long before Chen Feng caught sight of a group of mountains, whose peaks rose high up into the clouds. Amongst them were several imposing-looking mountains. Every one of them rose into the white clouds and Chen Feng was unable to tell just how high up they went.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those mountains are likely over a thousand zhang high,” exclaimed Chen Feng. This was his first time seeing such a large mountain. After comparing them, Chen Feng found that the mountains he had seen in the past were practically little hills (1 zhang = 3.333 m).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was appreciating the distant mountains, two streams of light approached from afar to stop before Chen Feng. They were actually two cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators appeared to be around 20 years of age and there was an arrogant expression on their faces as they cast a condescending look at Chen Feng. Standing on flying swords, which gleamed with light, they stood with an upright stature. They sported long hair, long resplendent robes and had decorative jades on their waists. Their faces unobliging, they exuded a presence that only cultivators could have.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You there, hurry up and turn back!” The two of them shouted in unison, their eyes staring at Chen Feng. It felt as though they wanted to start a fight without even giving a single explanation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Chen Feng was shocked as he did not understand why they would want to stop him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The place in front has been cordoned off by our Purplecloud Sky Grotto, hurry up and turn back. Otherwise, we will kill you regardless of who you may be.” Seeing that Chen Feng was not reacting, the two of them shouted out once more. At the same time, a sharp sword intent radiated out from their bodies towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Purplecloud Sky Grotto, what a coincidence.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought to himself. That ‘Fifth Senior Brother’ that he had killed back then was from Purplecloud Sky Grotto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These two are likely cultivators at level 1 of the Concealed stage. The flying swords they are flying on are merely grade 1 Magic artefacts. Although they are also wearing protective clothing, if a fight erupts, they are certainly no match for me. However, they may have reinforcements nearby.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Surely this place is not within your Purplecloud Sky Grotto’s territory? Stopping others just like this, aren’t you fellows being too overbearing?” asked Chen Feng coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Overbearing? Ha ha ha ha! Kid! Are you new to the cultivation world? You are actually not backing off after hearing the name Purplecloud Sky Grotto. Since that is the case, don’t blame us for being rough. Once we take action, getting utterly obliterated will be the end for you. A pity, your cultivation will be lost,” said one of them with a sneer as he opened up his palm. A purple stream of light glowed from within his palm. It appeared he was about to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was inwardly infuriated. These fellows wanted to kill him for no reason at all. Purplecloud Sky Grotto, what a haughty existence. Just as Chen Feng was about to attack and kill off the two cultivators, another cultivator arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Purplecloud Sky Grotto, what infamy! To think that you would dare set up a blockade here! What? Do you people really consider this place as your Purplecloud Sky Grotto’s territory?” A menacing voice rang out from the side as a dark-faced and tall middle-aged cultivator flew over. He wore voluminous cultivator clothing and there were some scars on his face, scars which intersected one another. His eyes gleamed with a belligerent light. One glance was all it took for Chen Feng to tell that he was not some good-natured fellow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you? Hold it right there and turn back!” The two cultivators from Purplecloud Sky Grotto shouted out once more. However, their eyes revealed wariness as this newcomer had flown over without the help of flying swords or any other Magic artefacts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That meant this newcomer’s cultivation base had exceeded the controlling objects with divine sense (1<sup>st</sup>) level. He was at least at level 2 of the Concealed stage. He may even be at level 3.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A loud sound rang out as one of the Purplecloud Sky Grotto cultivators was slapped on the face by the dark-faced cultivator. The slap was so strong, it caused the cultivator’s figure to spiral fiercely in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are courting death!” The other Purplecloud Sky Grotto cultivator’s face sank and the purple stream of light in his palm flashed at an increased rate. It swiftly formed a sharp sword. The cultivator then swung it towards the dark-faced cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The dark-faced cultivator simply reached out with his hand and made a grasping motion, causing the purple sword to explode into smithereens. Next, he spread out his fingers once more and sent another slap forward, striking the attacking cultivator on the face. The two cultivators from Purplecloud Sky Grotto were thus left spiralling non-stop in the middle of the air. They were momentarily incapable of utilizing their cultivation base at all and an abnormal amount of humiliation rose within their hearts. It was such that they found themselves on the verge of vomiting blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hold!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them bellowed out in unison and energy currents surged through their bodies, causing their bodies to abruptly come to a halt. After that, the two of them shouted again as they attacked the dark-faced cultivator once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A small and exquisite flying sword and a bluish-green seal stamp pierced through the sky as they charged towards the dark-faced cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The exquisite flying sword was only one chi in length. Its surface gleamed with light as it pierced through the sky with a dextrous and lightning-like speed. It was shooting at the dark-faced cultivator with the intention to kill him (1 chi = 0.333 m).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, the bluish-green seal that was still charging through the sky grew increasingly large. In but an instant, it had become as big as a building. The force of a falling hill descended from the sky towards the dark-faced cultivator.</span></p>
