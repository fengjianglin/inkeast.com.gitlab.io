 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s action of flying in from the distance had immediately caught the attention of Mo Ji and the others. Naturally, the bandits merely took Chen Feng to be a passing-by cultivator. However, it was different with Mo Ji. When Mo Ji saw Chen Feng, light shone from her eyes before subsiding. It was unknown what was going on within her mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Did she recognize me?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After arriving, Chen Feng hovered in the sky as he observed their fight from a distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The four blade-wielding bodyguards attacked and at least one bandit would fall with every passing moment. That caused the rate at which the bandits were losing to quicken. In the end, they turned and ran. All that was left in their minds was the desire to flee. Thus, they dispersed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The bandits have quite a high level of combat power. Only after losing so many people could they be routed. However, those blade-wielding bodyguards are even stronger. Although their respective levels are not high, their auras are as deep as the ocean and as thick as mountains. Cultivators on the same level as them are simply no match for them. Not to mention, they complement each other spectacularly. The attacks they unleashed bolstered one another, helping to finish off their enemies. It could even help increase their offensive prowess. It seems these bodyguards must have trained together since their younger days, otherwise such a level of cooperation would have been impossible.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng carefully analysed the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Judging by that, this Mo Ji must have some background. Hey, last time, this woman deceived me and so many others to go to our deaths in Demon Soul Valley. In the end, I snatched away her weapon. How will she react if she recognizes me?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng snickered. He was looking forward to seeing how things will develop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, the fleeing bandits ran into the nearby Blackwind Mountain. Some had failed to flee and were killed off by the four bodyguards. The four bodyguards left not a single straggler alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was wondering what to do next, Mo Ji suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellow cultivator, why don’t you come down and have a chat?” Mo Ji’s voice was as languid as ever. Hearing that voice would invoke a feeling of laziness within others, making them not want to resist.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he.” Chen Feng chuckled. Next, his figure abruptly drew an arc across the sky as he landed in front of Mo Ji.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After getting a clear look at Chen Feng’s face, Mo Ji spontaneously exclaimed. A tangled expression appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is it, Miss Mo Ji? Do you not recognize an old friend?” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is you! Chen Feng, what are you doing here?” Mo Ji’s eyes flared and a hint of killing intent seeped out from her body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The eight bodyguards stepped forward simultaneously to surround Chen Feng. Immediately, Chen Feng sensed eight auras locking down on him. Any overt moves from him would result in formidable attacks aimed at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this? Are you planning to do something to me?” Chen Feng revealed an easy-going smile as he ignored the pressure bearing down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Ji glared at Chen Feng for a moment before waving her hand. Next, the auras emanating from the eight bodyguards disappeared. Then, moving in a uniform manner, they lined up behind Mo Ji.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, hand over my Bloody Soul and I will spare you today,” Mo Ji said icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, is that so? Right, I remembered! You still owe me my payment,” Chen Feng said light-heartedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was speculating. Since Mo Ji could emerge unscathed, the fox yao must have won in the fight against Sage Whitelake and Sage Ironsleeve. However, did the fox yao succeed in breaking free from the seal within Demon Soul Valley?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was a Yao King, after all. After recovering its powers, it could turn the world of cultivation upside down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Tower had mentioned before that Mo Ji’s body contains the fox yao’s blood. Does that mean Mo Ji is a descendant of the Nine-tailed Fox? He he</span></em><span>. When Chen Feng thought of that, he could not stop himself from smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems you specifically came here to settle the account.” The aura on Mo Ji’s body abruptly converged and her voice turned cool. The change made it impossible to figure out her state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. I did not come here for you. However, since we’ve encountered one another, we should settle our previous account,” Chen Feng said with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, do you not understand your current situation? Although your recent improvement in cultivation base is shocking, I can easily kill you right now.” Once again, Mo Ji’s voice took on the same languid tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You think that you, these eight fellows and the hidden old man can do it?” Chen Feng grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? You-” Mo Ji’s face finally sank. With a grasping move, she brought her Demonfiend Sword out. At the same time, her eight bodyguards unleashed their sharp blade energies from their bodies once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Little girl, don’t do it.” An elderly voice rang out and an elderly man with white hair and beard suddenly appeared before Mo Ji.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Little brother, you are not to be underestimated. To think that you can notice me.” The elderly man turned towards Chen Feng, a smile on his face. It would appear he bore no ill will against Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The way I see it, Miss Mo Ji is even more of a character that should not be underestimated. To possess an expert with 6 Lightning Tribulations under his belt protecting her, she must possess quite the background,” Chen Feng said with his own smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that shocked the elderly man as well. His eyes shone as he attempted to look right through Chen Feng’s state. The fact that Chen Feng could notice him hiding nearby was already surprising. But right now, Chen Feng had successfully determined his level of strength. He was beyond surprised now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, who are you exactly?” the elderly man asked in a serious voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Extreme Celestial Sect’s elite disciple, Chen Feng,” Chen Feng said, a grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Extreme Celestial Sect’s disciple?” Mo Ji was taken aback and she froze for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What, don’t believe me? I have my token here.” After saying that, Chen Feng brought out his elite disciple identification token and shook it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You really are a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. I had misjudged you back then.” Mo Ji’s eyes flashed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After pondering for a moment, Mo Ji said, “Chen Feng, it is better to put an end to grudges. How about this? I will forget about Bloody Soul and we forget about the grudge between us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Aren’t you generous? This is a grade 2 Prized artefact. Not to mention, it is also a demonic artefact with an extraordinary value. Do you really not want to snatch it back?” Chen Feng grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Your show of confidence and your nonchalance towards whether or not I would try to snatch it back means you must already be prepared. Not to mention, you are a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. I would rather not offend another disciple from the great orthodox sects. Rather than make an enemy, why not make a friend? Since you like that lance, I will give it to you,” Mo Ji said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! If so, we can forget about what happened in the past,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since we are friends now, Miss Mo Ji should be able to tell me about your background, right?” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. It would be best for you to not know about my background. Knowing about it will not benefit you.” Mo Ji revealed a mysterious smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Mo Ji’s unwillingness to divulge anything, Chen Feng chose not to probe further. At any rate, everyone had their own secrets. Additionally, the relationship between Chen Feng and Mo Ji had not reached the point where they can trust one another. They had been on the brink of attacking each other earlier, after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right. Chen Feng, since you are a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect, why did you come here? Driftcloud Immortal Mountain has recently become a very popular place and many cultivators from your Extreme Celestial Sect have gone there. Why aren’t you going there?” Mo Ji changed the topic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. I don’t like going to lively places,” Chen Feng answered smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am here to perform a task for the sect, to wipe out the bandits in Blackwind Mountain. Then, I can rise to the rank of core disciple,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? You are after the bandits here?” A look of shock flashed across Mo Ji’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. What is it? You look like you have something on your mind.” Chen Feng found something peculiar about Mo Ji’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You should already know the might of the bandits here when you accepted the task, right?” Mo Ji said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course. The three bandit leaders here are only at level 1 of the Sky Human stage. There’s nothing to fear,” Chen Feng replied, grinning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems you’ve made yourself quite a number of enemies inside the sect.” There was a hint of amusement within Mo Ji’s voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you mean by that?” Chen Feng already had an inkling of what Mo Ji would say next.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The might of the bandits here is not what you imagine. From what I can tell, there are at least 10 Sky Human stage cultivators amongst the Blackwind Mountain bandits. Additionally, in order to enter Blackwind Mountain, you must go through layer after layer of killing arrays. Even the ordinary Sky Human stage cultivators would not be able to make it past the killing arrays.” Mo Ji casted an ambiguous smile at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you telling the truth?” Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is there a reason for me to lie to you? My objective for coming here is Blackwind Mountain. The way I see it, we can cooperate,” Mo Ji said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cooperate? He he! I am afraid that what happened last time will happen again.” Chen Feng sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Regardless if you believe me or not, your strength alone is insufficient to fight against the Blackwind Mountain bandits,” Mo Ji said with a chortle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? But if Blackwind Mountain possesses such a formidable force, even our combined might will be incapable of dealing with them, no?” Chen Feng countered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My men are not limited to just these fellows. My men have yet to arrive. I have simply come in advance to check out the enemy,” Mo Ji said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Since you have enough manpower, why bother cooperating with me? I am just a minor Concealed stage cultivator,” Chen Feng said with a sneer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, if you do not believe me, then so be it. Forget about a cooperation. You handle your own matters and I will handle mine. Let’s just keep our distance in the future.” Clearly, Mo Ji was growing angry.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng fell silent. He could not let his guard down against Mo Ji. This woman was too mysterious and there was no way to know what she was plotting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, young man. Although you are just at the Concealed stage, you possess a combat power equivalent to those in the Sky Human stage. Am I right?” the elder standing beside Mo Ji finally said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he.” Chen Feng chuckled, not answering the question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In truth, Chen Feng was pondering. <em>If Mo Ji is right, then the might of the bandits here is several times higher than what I had expected. In other words, there is something wrong with the information provided by the sect. Originally, I had assumed that this is just a simple task. But now, it would appear that this is an extremely dangerous one. If I had recklessly charged into Blackwind Mountain without knowing anything beforehand, he he, that would have resulted in quite the show!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>An elite disciple wanting to get promoted must face the siege of at least 10 Sky Human stage cultivators? That fellow will surely die. In other words, those guys wanted me dead. He he. No wonder I felt something amiss with their expressions back then. To think that they were plotting something behind my backs.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng sneered inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
