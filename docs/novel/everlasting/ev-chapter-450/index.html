 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good. If so, stay here. Once I have collected everything here, I will deal with you two.” After saying that, Chen Feng released the grip on Xiao Jian and the insidious-looking man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, you’re up,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! I’ve been waiting a long time for this,” Tower said, waving his hand. The mountain range shook and items flew out from several spots before flying into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Those were none other than cultivation materials such as spirit stones, metal ores, magic treasures and others. All of them were items owned by the Skycloud Mountain bandits. At that moment, Tower was looting everything, leaving not a single scrap behind. Likewise, he had long since collected the storage-type magic treasures on the killed bandits.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, the insidious-looking man and Xiao Jian’s mouths twitched. There was an incomparable feeling of pain within their hearts. The Skycloud Mountain bandits had had to risk their lives for years to seize those resources. And now, Chen Feng had looted everything. The insidious-looking man felt as though his heart was bleeding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. I didn’t think that such a small place could have so many good items.” Jian Xiaotian then walked over. He stood before a pile of magic treasures, the wounds on his body were already almost fully healed up. Stretching his hand out, he picked up a sword and tutted as he praised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Looks like we gained ourselves quite the harvest this time. All this while, we’ve had to put up with being hunted. This can be a small form of compensation for us. Right, Brother Jian. You are a sword cultivator. Check and see if there are any swords that you like,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing Chen Feng’s words, the insidious-looking man grew even more vexed. He thought to himself: <em>The one who wanted to hunt you fellows down is Nine Firmaments Palace. Why on earth are you taking our items as compensation?</em> Naturally, he kept the thought to himself, not daring to speak it aloud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me have a look. There sure are a good number of magic treasures here. Looks like you fellows swindled and killed quite a high number of cultivators. In other words, the bandit profession is quite a good one. Brother Chen, I have a suggestion. Should we establish a bandit group to rob the passing-by cultivators?” Jian Xiaotian said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s a good idea. Unfortunately, we are not strong enough. There are too few of us. Not to mention, Nine Firmaments Palace is on the hunt for us. It would be great if we have a few Human Immortals to defend the place,” Chen Feng said with a grin. At the same time, he waved his hand and a black piece of metal flew into his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. This Starsource Stone must have fallen from outer space. It weighs at least 50 kilogrammes. This is a good material for forging magic treasures,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After saying that, Chen Feng sent the Starsource Stone flying away from his hand. The stone then flew into the Longevity Tower before disappearing from sight. Clearly, the Longevity Tower had devoured it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng smiled and picked up a wooden bar shaped like a dragon. After inspecting it for a moment, a look of shock appeared on his face. “Wyrmwood! It is around 3,000 years old. A good item. This is a good item for pill concoction!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I want this sword.” Jian Xiaotian picked up a sheathed sword. Even before he pulled out the sword, Chen Feng could already sense traces of sharp intent coming from it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A grade 6 metal-type Prized-tier sword, a good item!” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not spend too much time going through the looted items. After all, he did not have that much time to waste. His earlier actions of utilizing the Longevity Tower had caused quite a scene. Who knows if it would bring them any troubles?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are Manager He from Heavenly Origin Trade Association, right?” Chen Feng turned to look at the insidious-looking man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. I am a manager from Heavenly Origin Trade Association.” Manager He nodded his head, a look of shock flashing across his face. He did not understand how Chen Feng could know about him. However, he honestly answered Chen Feng’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me ask you. Other than these items, what other good items do you have?” Chen Feng asked smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No more. You have taken away all of our items here,” Manager He quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you certain there are no other treasures here?” Chen Feng asked in a serious tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am certain. All the items that Skycloud Mountain had looted in the past are now here,” Manager He said, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he!” Chen Feng snickered. Next, he turned to look at Xiao Jian. “Your name is Xiao Jian, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Xiao Jian nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You tell me. Was Manager He lying just now?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, a look of panic flashed across Manager He’s face. “I did not lie. I did not lie! Xiao Jian, tell him I did not lie!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not say anything. He simply stared intently at Xiao Jian, causing an incomparable feeling of dread to assail Xiao Jian’s heart. Gritting his teeth, Xiao Jian said, “Yes, Manager He was lying!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Xiao Jian, you’re courting death!” Manager He’s face sank sharply and he shouted at Xiao Jian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’re the one courting death.” Chen Feng’s face turned icy and he sent a palm strike out. Manager He was struck and blood sprayed out ceaselessly from his mouth as his figure flew over 100 metres backwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s figure flashed and he re-appeared before Manager He. Extending his finger, he jabbed Manager He’s forehead as he utilized the Soul Subduing Mantra’s Soul Lock Mantra to lock Manager He’s soul.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Even now, you can still lie. Looks like I cannot keep you alive,” Chen Feng said, grinning ferociously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I wouldn’t do such a thing again. I beg you, please don’t kill me. I will definitely answer whatever questions you have for me.” Manager He’s face was as pale as ash and he quickly begged for mercy, fearing that Chen Feng would kill him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I won’t kill you for now. However, you had the guts to lie to me. You must be punished.” After saying that, Chen Feng waved his hand and a swarm of fire wasps buzzed thunderously as they flew out. Since getting caught by Chen Feng and placed inside the Longevity Tower, the fire wasps’ rate of cultivation had grown much higher compared to their previous rate of cultivation. Already, more than 100 of them were close to reaching the Great Yao stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Woah!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Under Chen Feng’s command, the fire wasps instantly pounced upon Manager He. Immediately, a series of wretched screams escaped Manager He’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, do it! We cannot waste too much time,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! You are the one who keeps wasting time. I would have just killed them all. Why go through all this trouble?” Tower said with a dissatisfied tone. Next, he quickly moved towards one of the mountains there. With a wave of his hand, a formidable blast of energy shot out to easily cleave the mountain open. A large crack appeared and a thick amount of spiritual energy surged out from the crack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No wonder these bandits are so strong. There is actually a Prized crystal mine here,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the reveal of the Prized crystal mine, one cultivator after another swiftly emerged from the mountain. All of them were in tattered rags. Their faces were pale and they were all skinny. After emerging, there were looks of shock and apprehension on their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These people must have been captured for mining operations,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Before those people could figure out what was going on, a massive sword suddenly appeared. With a sweeping motion, it killed off all of the cultivators who had emerged from the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, Tower was the one who had attacked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity Sword, sigh!” Chen Feng sighed. He did not stop Tower. He did, however, felt his heart stirring. None of those cultivators could be allowed to live. And yet, killing off all those people for no reason was hard for Chen Feng to bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After locating the spirit stone mine, things became easier. The Longevity Tower went to work and it did not take long for it to devour the spirit stone mine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were 300 million Prized crystals in total. Tower devoured 280 million Prized crystals and left 20 million Prized crystals for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The rate at which the Longevity Tower devoured the spirit stones and the amount that it devoured shocked Jian Xiaotian. However, despite his shock, Jian Xiaotian did not ask anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower quickly shrank, becoming a small, one-chi-long miniature tower before flying into Chen Feng’s hand. The present Longevity Tower was slightly different compared to the past. Although there were still plenty of cracks on its surface, the simple-looking tower was emanating faint streams of spiritual energy. The streams of spiritual energy did not dissipate away. Instead, they swirled within a radius of one metre around the Longevity Tower, giving off the impression that there were clouds swirling around the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We caused such an uproar. We should hurry up and leave this place as soon as possible,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No rush. There is something else here,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There’s more?” Chen Feng was puzzled. The Longevity Tower had already enveloped the entire Skycloud Mountain earlier. Could they have missed anything?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Follow me.” The Longevity Tower radiated a halo of light, which enveloped Chen Feng before transforming into a stream of light as it flew through the sky. When it landed, Chen Feng saw that they were already 50 kilometres away from Skycloud Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This lake.” There was a lake with a radius of over 50 kilometres there. Although Chen Feng was incapable of seeing what was inside, he could instinctively sense that the lake was not an ordinary lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is there a treasure inside this lake?” Chen Feng guessed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’ll know soon enough,” Tower said with an amused tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Chen Feng was about to enter the lake, the surface of the lake abruptly exploded and large pillars of water rose upwards. As the lake’s waters heaved and splashed, a colossal creature charged out from the lake and opened its mouth to reveal serrated fangs. It then moved to chomp Chen Feng. At the same time, a formidable suction force enveloped Chen Feng’s figure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng unleashed a palm strike to send the water monster flying. Immediately after that, however, the water monster spun and its wide and mighty tail swiped at Chen Feng. The swiping move affected the lake, which exploded yet again. The force behind the explosions could pierce even a thick steel plate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the attack, Chen Feng unleashed a lightning-fast punch, which collided against the large incoming tail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a thunderous boom, Chen Feng’s figure slid over 100 metres backwards. As for the water monster, it simply flipped over once before charging at Chen Feng once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What an immense amount of power. That attack contains a force of at least half a million kilogrammes behind it. Just what kind of water monster is this?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Before Chen Feng could get a good look at the appearance of the water monster, the water monster’s attack had arrived once more. Opening its mouth, it fired a torrential pillar of water at Chen Feng. It was so fast that Chen Feng could not dodge the attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, who had positioned his palms forward to block the attack, felt as though a mountain had slammed against him. His entire body shook and he lost control over himself. His figure was once again sent several hundred metres backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s figure had only just flown some distance away when the pillar of water which had smashed against him suddenly twisted. It twisted to form tangible-looking ropes and moved to form circles, which then moved to bind Chen Feng.</span></p>
