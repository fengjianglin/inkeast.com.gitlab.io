 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These two old men are so fast. We are definitely no match for them,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like we can no longer flee. We’ll have to figure some way to kill them off,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Where else can you two run off to?” The two old men drew a line of light across the sky to intercept Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. One of the two old men waved his hand to bring about the clouds and winds, and the forces within their surroundings moved to suppress Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Such speed! With just a wave of his hand, he could mobilize worldly forces. These two are truly very powerful!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought. He swiftly brought out the Demon Sealing Sword and the space before him was seemingly sliced into two; the attack that the old man sent out was split and the two split portions of the attack flew past Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk! The first thing you bring out is a Sacred artefact? Hey, hey, you two must have some good items on you. Fine! Since you fellows are unwilling to come quietly, I’ll have to take action!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scarlet Yang Soul Refining Formula!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A miniature blazing sun suddenly rose up from one of the old man’s hand. Next, it shot towards both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian at an extreme velocity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the blazing sun, Chen Feng immediately felt his mind falling into a state of panic. If he hadn’t practiced the Soul Subduing Mantra, his soul power would have been scattered by this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pu!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian’s body shuddered and he instantly coughed out a mouthful of blood. Even though the blazing sun had yet to make contact, Jian Xiaotian had already lost the ability to fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What a formidable soul attack! I wonder, can the Demon Sealing Sword defend against it?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered. As Chen Feng was displaying his sword techniques to take on the attack, the Longevity Tower, still hidden within his body, took action on its own. A suction force absorbed the blazing sun into the tower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As expected, he is practicing soul refining techniques. Kid, this time, there is hope for your Soul and Anima acupoints,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Cha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A scraping sound rang out as the Demon Sealing Sword in Chen Feng’s grasp left a sword wound on the old man’s body. Blood began flowing ceaselessly from the wound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? What happened?” Looks of shock appeared on both of the old men’s faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The kid has something else on him. All right. Let’s attack together! Hurry up and kill the two of them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scarlet Yang Soul Refining Formula!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Elemental Sun Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two miniature blazing suns descended; one was emitting an unending wave of emanations capable of shocking the soul while the other was shining with a dazzling intensity that resembled that of the real sun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One was a soul attack while the other one was a magic attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Remarkable! These two old men have such sinister appearances. Unexpectedly, the techniques they practice are so overbearing!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng reflexively thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A suction force suddenly appeared and the two blazing suns were absorbed once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, two ropes suddenly emerged from the void to tie up and pull the two old men into the Longevity Tower, where they were then suppressed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sii! Brother Chen, what artefact tier is your magic treasure at? Is it really an Immortal artefact?” asked a shocked Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I am uncertain about that myself,” Chen Feng replied with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As a matter of fact, Chen Feng truly did not know what artefact tier the Longevity Tower was at. In the beginning, Chen Feng had assumed that the Longevity Tower was only an Immortal artefact at best. However, judging from the words he had exchanged with Tower and the tone of Tower’s voice during their exchange of words, Chen Feng had this feeling that it was not just an Immortal artefact. However, Chen Feng did not even know what artefact tier was above the Immortal tier. Thus, Chen Feng himself was confused.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, let’s hurry up and leave.” Chen Feng waved his hand and brought Jian Xiaotian into the Longevity Tower. Next, he utilized the Longevity Tower’s power to jump through space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower’s ability to jump through space was not much slower compared to the speed of the teleportation array. It did not take long for them to cover a distance of over 5,000 kilometres.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! Looks like our plan to utilize the teleportation arrays in large cities is unreliable. Even the small cities could be prone to unknown variables. Looks like we’ll have to figure some other ways,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No worries. If it comes down to it, we’ll just use the Longevity Tower to slowly jump there,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the Longevity Tower shook and a formidable aura surged into every part of Chen Feng’s body. However, the aura did not disappear. Instead, it kept scouring Chen Feng’s entire body, both interior and exterior. As the scouring process was going on, Chen Feng felt as though his body had become transparent. He could sense every cell and every bit of flesh on his body. However, that was not all. The aura was extremely profound and powerful, far more powerful compared to the immortal energy that he had absorbed in the past. Every time it scoured his body, his body would grow stronger by a notch. Even the intensity of his burning Soulflame grew by a notch. Additionally, there was no bottleneck and no saturation point.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Originally, Chen Feng’s cultivation base had hit a bottleneck. However, under the effects of the scouring aura, his body’s power began rising again. In fact, the rate of growth was so fast, it secretly shocked Chen Feng, who wondered if he was dreaming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, due to his flesh becoming crystal clear to the eyes, the various insight acupoints on his body began flashing faintly, like stars flashing from within Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Starting from the Heavenly Origin acupoint to the recently-opened Life and Death acupoints, it then spread to the other insight acupoints that Chen Feng had yet to open. All of them kept flashing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many insight acupoints! The human body is truly wondrous! These two should be the Soul and Anima acupoints, these two are the Yin and Yang acupoints, these two are the Void and Manifest acupoints and this brightest one should be the Return acupoint. There are countless more insight acupoints here. Whatever! I’ll just remember as much of them as I can!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite his present level of soul power, Chen Feng was still incapable of remembering the location of all the flashing insight acupoints. Even so, he was already very satisfied. This sudden turn of events would greatly reduce the amount of time needed for his future cultivation progress. This was a terrifying amount of reduction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every time Chen Feng managed to break through, impurities would be ejected out from his body. This time, the amount of impurities ejected was even greater than before. His fleshly body became even more exquisite and durable, like an amalgamation of jade and metal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The aura scoured Chen Feng’s body several hundred times before stopping. Chen Feng’s body was left with a relaxing feeling. When his primary energy circulated, every one of his pores would breathe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, what happened?” Chen Feng, who was feeling surprised, finally had the time to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My powers have recovered to the Sacred artefact tier,” Tower replied happily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s truly wonderful news! However, how did that aura boost my cultivation by this much? Even if I am to cultivate by breathing in immortal energy for 10 years, I will not be able to improve my cultivation base by this much, no?” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are seriously underestimating me here. When you think about it, I can be considered as your lifebound magic treasure. My powers, the powers of the Longevity Tower, have risen. As it is part of you, it is only natural that you, too, would be able to obtain a great deal of benefits,” Tower said happily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, there is one drawback for you. I am less able to take action in the future. Things were different when my powers were weak as others would not be able to sense anything. At present, however, I have recovered to the Sacred artefact tier. Thus, by constantly taking action, it becomes possible for my former enemies to notice me. Although the chances of that happening is small, you should be cautious. After all, it wasn’t easy to recover to this level,” Tower said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. Unless absolutely necessary, I will not use the Longevity Tower,” Chen Feng replied solemnly as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what happened to you earlier?” Seeing Chen Feng grow still, Jian Xiaotian came to stand before him. The aura that Chen Feng had suddenly emanated earlier was too ferocious, scaring Jian Xiaotian to the point where he had to retreat up to tens of metres away from Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s nothing. I was able to comprehend something and managed to acquire a sudden breakthrough,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? A sudden breakthrough? For real? From what I can sense from your aura earlier, you have probably become several times stronger. This is too absurd!” Jian Xiaotian’s eyes were wide open. When he had first met Chen Feng, there had not been too much of a difference in strength between them. However, after just a short time, Chen Feng’s strength had risen, seemingly at a straight, multiplicative line.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In terms of combat prowess, Chen Feng had long since surpassed him. Most importantly, he was already at level 3 of the Sky Human stage while Chen Feng had yet to even overcome his first Lightning Tribulation. The past Jian Xiaotian had considered himself a genius. Since meeting Chen Feng, however, his arrogance had taken a hit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were chatting away, Tower had finished off the two old men he sucked in. The two old men were elders from Star Assembly Sect, cultivators at level 8 of the Sky Human stage. Tower had used them to concoct Pure Essence Pills. This time, the Pure Essence Pills he concocted contained the power of Soul and Anima. After taking the pills, Chen Feng will be able to increase the rate at which he can assail his Soul and Anima acupoints, thereby increasing his strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Two experts from Star Assembly Sect have died to me. Looks like my list of enemies in the Northern Plains is growing longer</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng was quick to shift his feelings of concern aside. If he could attain enough power, the one who should feel concerned would be those people and not him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian would intermittently move in the direction of the Central Plains. When they encountered cultivators, they would hide, going to some sparsely populated place to cultivate themselves for some time. It did not take long for three months to pass. The two of them continued their journey, moving and stopping on occasions to finally cover a distance of 50,000 kilometres. It was a somewhat leisurely feeling. Not getting pursued by those who either wanted to kill or capture them, they no longer felt like fugitives on the run.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! I am getting closer to level 4 of the Sky Human stage. Looks like my Lightning Tribulation is not far off. Unexpectedly, this trip to the Northern Plains would allow my cultivation base to rise so quickly. Ha ha ha! When I return to the sect, I will surely shock my fellow brothers and sisters!” Jian Xiaotian laughed, feeling pleased with himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had been spending the past few months assailing his Soul and Anima acupoints. Today, he finally felt something. Thus, he had decided to stop within a small and somewhat sparse forest to cultivate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had originally intended on going to a mountain range 500 kilometres ahead. The winding mountain range stretched across a distance of 5,000 kilometres. And while there were many yao beasts and cultivators there, it was a good place to hide and practice cultivation. However, as the feeling had come, Chen Feng could no longer go forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were a few reasons why Chen Feng could cultivate so quickly. Firstly, it was because of the profundity of the Longevity Scripture. Secondly, it was because of the Pure Essence Pills containing the power of Soul and Anima.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Chen Feng had already determined the positions of his Soul and Anima acupoints. Thus, he intended on opening the two insight acupoints in one go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He circulated his cultivation technique and the power of Soul and Anima that he had absorbed began coursing through his body. Finally, they linked up with the Soul and Anima acupoints. The power of Soul and Anima transformed, assuming the shape of a Longevity Lance and it began spinning as it assailed the Soul and Anima acupoints.</span></p>
