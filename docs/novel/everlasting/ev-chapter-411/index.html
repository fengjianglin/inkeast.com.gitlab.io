 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With Mu Sheng’s assistance, Grotto Mistress Hypnosis became filled with vigour and was able to face the next tribulation lightning at full strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha. Thank you, Senior Mu,” Chen Feng gave his thanks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is just a simple matter for me. Besides, I had absorbed so much of your immortal energy. It is only right that I repay you for it.” Mu Sheng waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Grotto Mistress Hypnosis succeeded in overcoming her Lightning Tribulation, rising up to level 2 of the Sky Human stage. However, her whole body was covered in wounds and she was left in a terribly weakened state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Sheng waved his hand again and the life-type spiritual energy within the valley converged before entering Grotto Mistress Hypnosis’ body. Once again, the wounds on Grotto Mistress Hypnosis’ body began healing rapidly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thank you, Senior Mu!” Grotto Mistress Hypnosis came before Mu Sheng and said, her face filled with gratitude.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, don’t mention it,” Mu Sheng replied with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good! This is good! This time, everyone managed to grow stronger and the three of you even managed to overcome Lightning Tribulation. This is a joyous occasion!” Chen Feng said, beaming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you look so happy. Did you manage to gain something as well?” Tower secretly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Observing the Lightning Tribulations earlier, by feeling the energies and impression they gave off, I feel enlightened. There is also the atmosphere of vitality created by Senior Mu’s cultivation process earlier. The Life and Death acupoints within my body have begun to loosen,” Chen Feng replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, really? Looks like you are not without any comprehension abilities,” Tower then said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!” Chen Feng responded with a snort and ignored Tower. Instead, he silently focused on recalling the impression of life and death that he had experienced earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Following the Longevity Scripture, the Nine Grand acupoints had to be opened for level 9 of the Concealed stage. The nine acupoints were: Soul, Anima, Yin, Yang, Life, Death, Void, Actual and Return. At that moment, Chen Feng had managed to gain some comprehension towards the Life and Death acupoints, making them the first two insight acupoints that he would work on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, they did not leave the valley as they silently cultivated themselves. The spiritual energy there was high. Add the immortal energy that Chen Feng released into the equation, everyone’s cultivation base kept rising.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ten days after Chen Feng began cultivating his Life and Death acupoints, he found that he could not accurately point out the locations of the two acupoints. He could only acquire a faint feeling for them. Even so, Chen Feng did gain some harvest for his efforts. The level of his soul had risen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Truly shocking. I didn’t think that my attempts to assail these insight acupoints alone could increase the level of my soul</span></em><span>, Chen Feng blurted inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! You are currently just cultivating the Life and Death acupoints. Wait until you are cultivating the Soul and Anima acupoints. Just see how much stronger your soul power would become then!” Tower laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Soul and Anima. Yes. Once I open these two insight acupoints, my soul power will skyrocket.” Chen Feng nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for another month to pass by. All they did within the valley was cultivate and cultivate and their strength rose every day. Thus, not a single one of them felt bored. As for Mu Sheng, he casually sat within the valley with his eyes closed, not moving in the slightest. He looked like a dead man. However, everyone could clearly feel that the vitality within the valley was growing stronger by the day.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>On this particular day, Chen Feng was attempting to sense the location of the Life acupoint when he sensed formidable ripples coming from the space around him. Immediately, he snapped open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are people fighting nearby.” Jian Xiaotian swiftly moved towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This has been a very peaceful month. It would appear that someone has found this valley. However, there are powerful yao beasts defending the outer areas of Azuremist Mountain. For this to happen despite that, the other side must be experts,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had only just said that when a rainbow appeared on the sky. The rainbow streaked forward from the distance to enter the valley. A cultivator with a highly domineering atmosphere stood atop the rainbow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A level 9 Sky Human stage cultivator. There is only one step between him and the Human Immortal stage,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Finally, these experts have begun taking action,” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows below, report your names!” The cultivator appeared to be around 30 years old. Wearing black clothes, he sported a tall coronet on his head while his hand gripped a sword, which was gleaming with dazzling light. His shout caused a world-encompassing aura to assail Chen Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ta! Ta! Ta!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Everyone there, Chen Feng included, reflexively took a few steps backwards. At the same time, Chen Feng could feel an unfathomable soul power pressing down on his sea of wisdom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Humph! Regardless of who he may be, this action of his is too overbearing!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng immediately grew irritated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“And who are you? You broke in without asking the owner’s permission. What is the difference between you and a bandit?” Chen Feng said loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, after hearing Chen Feng’s words, an icy and harsh look flashed across the cultivator’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Impudence! A little insect dares to talk back to me? You don’t know the meaning of death!” The cultivator waved his hand and a five-coloured stream of light converged to form a sword beam before shooting towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Judging by the direction taken by the sword beam, it was aimed right at Chen Feng’s sea of energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A tree branch suddenly flew over to smash the sword beam apart. Mu Sheng had taken action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! You don’t even know me, but you unleashed such a vicious move right from the start? You are quite ruthless, oh exalted one!” Chen Feng said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, there are experts here. It seems my assessment was wrong.” The black-clad cultivator turned to look at Mu Sheng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I dare not take on the title of expert. However, killing a small fry like you will not be an issue for me,” Mu Sheng said nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“With your abilities? What a braggart! Whatever, I will teach you insects a lesson,” the black-clad cultivator said as a five-coloured light radiated fiercely from his entire body. Like rays of sunlight, sword beams descended towards every single person in the valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sword beams appeared weak. However, Chen Feng and the others knew that every one of them could easily kill off those below level 9 of the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as the sword beams were about to land on their heads, a huge flower suddenly grew out from the ground. The delicate-looking petals were actually capable of completely blocking off the sword beams.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? So, you are not a human, but a spirit monster. Whatever! Today, I will be purging demons and slaying yaos!” said the black-clad cultivator, who pulled out the sword in his hand. Unsheathing his sword, he caused light to shine brightly, and the atmosphere he radiated became even more powerful. He appeared like a Heavenly God stepping down upon the mundane world.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fool.” A ridiculing look appeared on Mu Sheng’s face. With a flick of his fingers, an emerald-coloured tree branch appeared in the sky. Next, it gave a sudden swing and a loud popping sound could be heard as the black-clad cultivator was slapped away. His figure landed head first into the ground and mud entered his mouth as a result. He cut quite the wretched sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black-clad cultivator was not badly wounded by that. However, it was an extremely embarrassing situation. It was the equivalent of getting kicked down from Heaven into Hell.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black-clad cultivator stood up and roared at the sky. His face had turned red and his voice was filled with rage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha!” Chen Feng and the others laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Die! All of you must die!” The black-clad cultivator grew even more enraged. The sword in his grip flashed with golden light as he made ready to attack once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Is this fellow suffering from a mental condition? He is obviously no match for Senior Mu. And yet, he is still not trying to run away.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng mused, a smirk on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The tree branch swung and the black-clad cultivator was slapped to the ground once again. This time, the slap was even stronger than the previous one. Chen Feng and the others could even hear the sound of bones breaking coming from the black-clad cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One vine after another drilled out from the ground to tie the black-clad cultivator up. No matter how hard he struggled, he could not break free.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only then did the black-clad cultivator finally revealed a look of terror. Even so, he refused to show weakness and continued roaring.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. Who are you? Hurry up and spill it out,” Chen Feng stepped forward and said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scram! You have not even overcome your Lightning Tribulation! You dare speak to me? You don’t know the meaning of death!” the black-clad cultivator shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha!” Chen Feng laughed out loudly. Jian Xiaotian and the others had also gathered around. All of them were pointing at the black-clad cultivator, laughing as they did.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am certain. This fellow is definitely an idiot. However, I do not understand how he could cultivate up to this level!” Jian Xiaotian could not stop himself from laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! The way I see it, this fellow must be used to being in a lofty position, so much so that he could no longer view others normally. This is a typical display of arrogance. Today, I will wake him up,” said Chen Feng, who waved his hand. A sword light flashed out and a sword wound instantly appeared on the cultivator’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The wound was long and deep, exposing even the bones inside. More importantly, the sword Chen Feng used was the grade 9 Prized-tier sword, Fire Wyrm Sword. Fiery sword energy kept drilling into the cultivator’s body, destroying the vitality within.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! You damnable fellows! You dare treat me like this? Don’t you know who I am?” the black-clad cultivator cried out wretchedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As if I care.” Chen Feng waved his hand again and another deep sword wound appeared on the black-clad cultivator’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am Purple Firmaments Palace’s elder, Kuang Batian! You dare treat me like this? I will bring the nine familial extermination down upon you!” the black-clad cultivator bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, he is someone from Purple Firmaments Palace.” Everyone exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Afraid now, aren’t you? Hurry up and let me go! You buffoons! Hurry up and let me go!” Kuang Batian shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, this fellow is suffering from a mental condition. Just kill him. He’s a real bother,” Lin Shaokun said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No rush,” Chen Feng said, his palm suddenly exerting a suction force. A torrential sound rang out as vast amounts of blood was pulled out due to his actions. The blood condensed within Chen Feng’s palm to become a ball of blood, which kept spinning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. The blood essence of a level 9 Sky Human stage cultivator. The Blood Pill concocted using his blood will surely have a high grade, no?” After saying that, Chen Feng began utilizing the Longevity Tower’s power. Soon, a blood-red medicinal pill appeared in his palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Lin, you have only just overcome your Lightning Tribulation. You should be needing energy right now. Try this Blood Pill,” said Chen Feng, who tossed the Blood Pill to Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“High-grade Earthen-tier medicinal pill. Not bad,” Lin Shaokun said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, where is mine?” Jian Xiaotian asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t be anxious. There is one for everyone,” said Chen Feng, who utilized the Demonic Heavengorging Art to absorb more blood essence from Kuang Batian’s body. It did not take long for him to concoct out two more Blood Pills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! My blood essence! You fellows will not have a good death! Do you all have a death wish?!” Kuang Batian bellowed madly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, a violent roar rang out from the sky and two cultivators displayed spiritwalking techniques to arrive at the valley. Even from afar, one of them had unleashed an attack aimed at Chen Feng and the others. With a swing of his hand, he sent a massive palm silhouette towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Two more level 9 Sky Human stage cultivators,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Sheng continued to display a look of nonchalance. His fingers flicked and a hurricane swirled up from the ground. A foliage expanded in size, reaching a radius of 10 zhang to block the massive palm silhouette.</span></p>
