 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The carvings on the surface of the mountain was of creatures that Chen Feng had never seen before. Every one of them were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, with clearly distinct scales and vivid colours. They looked so lifelike. There were even spiritual light gleaming within their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At any rate, the carvings of the creatures appeared alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The first creature Chen Feng laid his eyes on was something of a yao beast that looked like a wolf and yet, not quite like a wolf either. There were some other characteristics on it that made it look not like a wolf.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was more muscular, with thicker limbs and the hairs on its body were like steel needles. It seemed as though there was a bloody light flowing within each of its eyes. The most noticeable aspect of this creature was that it had two pairs of dark-red wings growing out from its back. It gave off an impression of wildness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That looks like a Four-winged Skysoar Wolf,” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! It is not. That is a demonic beast, the Demonic Nightwolf. It cultivates the power of darkness, blood and demons,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it’s a demonic beast. However, why does it feel alive?” Chen Feng found it strange. His eyes stared at the relief intently. That was especially so when he turned his attention towards the wolf’s eyes. He felt as though there was a magic power shooting out from the eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh!” Tower chuckled, but said nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng pondered for a moment. Next, his figure flashed forward to rapidly circle the mountain once. In the end, he noticed that there was a total of eight creature carvings on the relief. All the creatures looked like either yao beasts or demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In addition to the Demonic Nightwolf, there were seven other demonic beasts with ferocious appearances. The reason why Chen Feng finally decided that they were all demonic beasts was because he could not recognize a single one of them. More importantly, he could seemingly sense strands of demonic energy there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All of the creature carvings are demonic beasts, right? Ha ha! I actually do not recognize a single one. No. This one looks like a Nine-tailed Fox, a yao beast.” Chen Feng suddenly came to a halt before one of the creature carvings on the relief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A massive and sturdy body, with nine tails buoying in the air. It looked like the Nine-tailed Fox that Chen Feng knew of. The only difference was that there was a faint demonic energy coming out from this fox yao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Look closer,” Tower said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was thinking about getting a closer look, the corner of his eyes flashed with light, seemingly having noticed something. He turned to look to the side. One glance. His face instantly sank and his figure flashed backwards, covering a distance of over 1,000 metres in a flash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For Chen Feng, it felt as though he was moving beyond his limits. Although he believed that he was already in possession of a power that would allow him to remain collected in the face of death, his heart was still beating profusely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Promptly, Chen Feng activated his eye technique and the sharpness of his eyes was pushed to the max in a flash. The reason Chen Feng became so shocked all of a sudden was because he had finally found the Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the reason why Chen Feng became so shocked was not due to the existence of the Demon King. After all, he was chasing the Demon King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As he was observing the carving of the Nine-tailed Fox earlier, Chen Feng suddenly noticed that one of its tails was tightly wrapping up the Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demonic One-eyed Lizard had seemingly become one with the relief and it kept struggling and howling. However, no sound came from it. In fact, Chen Feng had been incapable of even noticing its acts of struggling earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It gave him a strangely unbearable feeling. If it weren’t for the fact that he had cultivated out the Magic Eyes of Darkness, one look at that would have caused his head to spin and vomit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The carvings are all alive!</span></em><span>&nbsp;The thought flashed across Chen Feng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, everything before Chen Feng seemingly flashed and he saw only fiery-red before his eyes. The surrounding space became as hard as iron and wave after wave of formidable restraining power surrounded him firmly. It felt as though the power wanted to crush him into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It's attacking me!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng dared not be careless. He channelled all his power into the Magic Eyes of Darkness as he attempted to see what was going on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His pupils spun and his vision grew slightly clearer. Seemingly figuring out what was happening, Chen Feng sent out the Twin Swords of Life and Death, using them to quickly create a large sword energy shield around him. Next, he flew back again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The amount of power that the Twin Swords of Life and Death unleashed this time was far stronger than before. Chen Feng could sense an intense crisis unfolding. If he were to fail to escape, he would face the same ending as the Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even a Demon King could get caught. Chen Feng was not one to overestimate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After steadying his figure, Chen Feng then found flames surging out before him. A domineering-looking Nine-tailed Fox had appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Raising his head, he saw that the carving of the Nine-tailed Fox on the surface of the mountain had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>So, they really are alive. That was truly dangerous. I was standing so close to it just now.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng felt shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Fiery heat waves blew towards Chen Feng, giving him a scorched feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Five Elemental acupoints’ Water acupoint and the Eight Trigram acupoints’ Water Trigram acupoint within Chen Feng’s body activated and a layer of water-type power enveloped him. At the same time, the power of ice from his body armour activated and strands of refreshing sensation washed over his whole body, making Chen Feng feel more comfortable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was defending against this opponent’s attack, the sky-encompassing flames abruptly disappeared. Next, the massive Nine-tailed Fox shrank to the size of a normal fox. However, the coercive atmosphere of power emanating from its body caused Chen Feng to gulp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It's so powerful! Its power far surpasses the Demonic One-eyed Lizard. Could it be the equivalent of a high-level Human Immortal?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There are eight carvings in total. One of them has transformed into a yao beast. If so, what about the others?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, the other carvings began moving as well. They started moving the same moment the thought flashed through Chen Feng’s mind. Although none of them moved out from the relief, their gazes were directed at Chen Feng. Due to their gazes, Chen Feng felt his blood roiling. It felt as though his body might blow up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Twin Swords of Life and Death could no longer protect Chen Feng and blood – like two arrows of blood – sprayed out from Chen Feng’s nostrils.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Realizing that this was a crisis, Chen Feng could not be bothered with concealing his power anymore. He immediately linked up with the Longevity Tower. After the Longevity Tower’s aura enveloped Chen Feng, the pressure bearing down on him instantly disappeared and his roiling blood returned to its normal state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng unscathed, the eight monsters grew surprised. Their gazes grew even more fiery. However, those gazes could no longer do anything to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human, why did you come here? Is it for the sake of capturing this little lizard?” A nonchalant voice rang out. Next, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard was swung heavily against the ground. The Demon King was still struggling to escape. However, its body was still tightly bound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You guys…” Chen Feng had wanted to continue the conversation only for the Nine-tailed Fox to cut him off. “It doesn’t matter why you are here. Now that you are here, there is only one end for you, death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After saying that, the Nine-tailed Fox immediately attacked Chen Feng. A massive tail swung to appear right before Chen Feng. Next, it buoyed about like a ribbon as it swirled around Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s figure flashed around as he did his best to display the Kirin Steps. Even so, he was still incapable of avoiding this attack. Just as the ribbon-like tail was about to wrap him up, he utilized the Longevity Tower’s power again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A formidable power coursed through every part of Chen Feng’s body, becoming one with him. Next, Chen Feng’s speed multiplied and he evaded the attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Human, you are just a minor Sky Human stage cultivator. How could you have evaded my attack?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was not just the Nine-tailed Fox, even the other monsters were looking at Chen Feng with shocked expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of them were very powerful. Naturally, they were also able to determine Chen Feng’s cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, this power does not belong to you. It comes from inside your body. I want to see just what is interfering here. Is it a magic treasure?” said the Nine-tailed Fox, who prepared to attack once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you are no match for this Four-eyed Spirit Fox. Let me help you,” Tower suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Four-eyed Spirit Fox? Isn’t that a Nine-tailed Fox?” Chen Feng was shocked. However, there was no longer anytime to be dwelling on it. Tower had already taken action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A semi-transparent silhouette of the Longevity Tower suddenly appeared to envelop Chen Feng and it allowed the Four-eyed Spirit Fox’s tail to swirl around Chen Feng, binding him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the silhouette of the Longevity Tower spun all of a sudden, emanating waves of slicing power as it did. It was as though it was the spinning form of countless flying swords, shredding the tail into minced meat in a flash, eliciting a furious howl from the Four-eyed Spirit Fox.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this?! It can actually hurt me? Human!!! You are dead!” The Four-eyed Spirit Fox’s tails swept around swiftly. They were no longer attempting to tie Chen Feng up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The semi-transparent silhouette of the Longevity Tower continued to spin. Next, a highly formidable suction force emerged from it. This suction force did not spread out. Instead, it was condensed into something of a beam, which swept out. As a result, the tails on the Four-eyed Spirit Fox instantly withered and the essence and blood energy were all devoured by the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heavengulping Absorption Technique!” Chen Feng was astounded. Unexpectedly, the Longevity Tower would utilize this move. However, the power behind this move from the Longevity Tower was over a million times stronger compared to his usage of the move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four-eyed Spirit Fox became somewhat terrified. It wasn’t just the blood essence within his tails that was devoured. Rather, even his essence power – inside his body – was stirring from the move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was then that a slit appeared above each of the Four-eyed Spirit Fox’s pair of eyes. The slits then grew larger. Surprisingly, two more eyes had appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It actually possesses four eyes. No wonder it is called the Four-eyed Spirit Fox.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The four eyes fired out beams of light simultaneously. Like sharp swords, the four beams sliced apart the suction force that the Longevity Tower sent out. &nbsp;Next, the Four-eyed Spirit Fox, feeling somewhat terrified, flew backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are you guys spacing out for! Hurry up and attack!” the Four-eyed Spirit Fox screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One by one, the seven monsters jumped out from the surface of the mountain. Every one of them radiated a savagery that could seemingly overflow the Heavens. Thick streams of demonic energy surged and they bellowed loudly the moment they emerged. If it weren’t for the protection of the semi-transparent silhouette of the Longevity Tower, the energy waves coming off the monsters alone could have quaked Chen Feng to death.</span></p>
