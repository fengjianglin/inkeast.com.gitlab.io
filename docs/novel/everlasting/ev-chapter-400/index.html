 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kiddo, the guys pursuing you fellows are getting closer, ke ke!” Tower suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These fellows are courting death! I’ll finish them off!” said Chen Feng, who brought out the Demon Sealing Sword. He linked up with it and began stimulating its power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to the bombardment from the besieging cultivators, the speed of the Skysoar Shuttle gradually slowed down. As a top-grade Prized artefact, the Skysoar Shuttle had remained unbroken in the face of the attacks. Even so, it was getting increasingly hard for Lin Shaokun to continue. Even the Pot Brothers were in a dizzy state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I really want to bring out the Longevity Tower and quake these fellows to death!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng swore inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, attack together! Break this Skysoar Shuttle!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I didn’t think that the Spirit Diviner’s divination is so accurate. He could actually predict that Chen Feng would appear here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another cultivator was smashed to death by the Skysoar Shuttle. In the process, however, a square-shaped seal stamp smashed against the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pu!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Lin Shaokun was no longer able to hold on. He sprayed out a mouthful of blood and the Skysoar Shuttle began wobbling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! They won’t be able to hold out much longer. Chen Feng, hurry up and come out! Do you want the shockwaves to kill you while you are still inside?” shouted a cultivator with a seal stamp in his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go out and fight them!” The will to fight radiated from Jian Xiaotian’s figure. He wanted to charge out and fight them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We cannot stop. We need to charge forward as soon as possible. Let me.” After saying that, Chen Feng’s figure flashed to re-appear outside the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng emerged, a blade beam, a sword beam and a square-shaped seal stamp instantly shot towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come.” Rays of sword light blossomed out from the Demon Sealing Sword in Chen Feng’s hand. The blade beam and sword beam were instantly dispersed while the seal stamp was shattered into bits by the light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! It’s a Sacred artefact!” The cultivators cried out in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a pulse, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chen Feng’s hand then unleashed several bolts of lightning forward. After that, however, Chen Feng did not bother observing the results of his move. Instead, he quickly flew back into the Skysoar Shuttle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After entering the shuttle, Chen Feng quickly sat down. He absorbed the immortal energy within the Longevity Tower to restore his power. That move earlier had exhausted 80 % of his power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Outside…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The bolts of lightning that Chen Feng sent out blew up several cultivators, tearing a total of 10 cultivators into pieces. The remaining cultivators were so horrified by the sight, they kept backing away. Not a single one of them dared to continue attacking. Watching the mist of blood, which continued to drift about in the sky, they stared with widened eyes. It was as though they had seen a ghost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun used the opportunity to have the Skysoar Shuttle charge ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and streams of thick immortal energy filled the Skysoar Shuttle. Lin Shaokun, who was already in a weakened state, inhaled once and was immediately reinvigorated. At the same time, the flight speed of the Skysoar Shuttle, too, rose.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They were getting closer and closer towards Azuremist Mountain. However, the pursuing auras were growing stronger. Perhaps it was because their pursuers were too confident in themselves, but they did not conceal their auras. Due to that, everyone could feel their backs shivering. It was as though there were thorns pricking their backs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four Old Phenoms quickly flew past the earlier battle site. Observing the remnant blood energy and killing intent that had yet to dissipate, they immediately realized what had happened just now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These little fellows are not to be underestimated. I had assumed that they would be obstructed. Unexpectedly, these loose cultivators are so worthless,” Second Phenom Bro said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The aura of a Sacred artefact! Someone utilized a Sacred artefact earlier!” Big Phenom Bro said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact? No wonder they could evade capture for so long. So, these kids have some good items on them.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll be reaching Azuremist Mountain soon!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They won’t be getting away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Magic Seal of Four Imagery!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the four old men sent out a stream of light from each of their palms. The four streams of light merged as one before abruptly spreading out, forming a peculiar-looking talisman.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The talisman moved with lightning-like speed. In fact, it was several times faster compared to the flight speed of the sword that the four of them were seated on. In just the blink of an eye, the talisman had disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After just a few breaths’ worth of time, the talisman caught up to the Skysoar Shuttle carrying Chen Feng and the others. Next, it pasted itself onto the surface of the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, countless runes began spreading out from the talisman to quickly wrap up the entire Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hnghh! What happened?” Lin Shaokun flinched. The Skysoar Shuttle slowed down continuously, seemingly on the verge of stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” Chen Feng hastily asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Skysoar Shuttle is under attack!” Lin Shaokun gritted his teeth. Next, he sprayed out a mouthful of blood essence. In response, the Skysoar Shuttle vibrated fiercely and the runes wrapping up the surface of the Skysoar Shuttle began receding.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ho! They could actually break our Magic Seal of Four Imagery. However, how many can you break?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the four old men unleashed another talisman. The Skysoar Shuttle, which had only just recovered, was not given any time to charge forward before another talisman entangled it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What the hell is this?” By then, Jian Xiaotian and the others had noticed what was happening outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is just a type of sealing magic,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll go out and deal with it.” Chen Feng flew out once again. The Demon Sealing Sword in his hand swung rapidly and the talisman glued to the Skysoar Shuttle instantly burst apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Skysoar Shuttle recovered its forward momentum. As for Chen Feng, he stood firmly atop the Skysoar Shuttle, his eyes focused, not blinking in the slightest as he stared at the back of the shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, another talisman flew forward. Like a meteor, it charged towards the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng swung, ripping the talisman into pieces with a sword strike.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? They can actually rip apart our Magic Seal of Four Imagery!” The Four Old Phenoms were surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are just relying on the power of a Sacred artefact. Grand Magic of Four Imagery, Six Paths and Eight Wilderness of the Cosmos!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the four of them began unleashing long-ranged attacks. This time, over 100 talismans charged towards the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many! Dimensional power!” Chen Feng set the Demon Sealing Sword straight atop the Skysoar Shuttle. Next, a dimensional power enveloped the Skysoar Shuttle and himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The attacks kept smashing against the barrier of the dimension, causing a series of booming sounds to ring out. After the series of attacks was over, the dimension that Chen Feng unleashed, too, disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Chen Feng saw their pursuers. They were four old men seated on a massive sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Our opponent’s speed is really fast. Looks like they’ll catch up to us before we even enter Azuremist Mountain,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! You there, kid! Hurry up and stop!” A thunderous voice crashed towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These are the four cultivators with 8 Lightning Tribulations under their belts. Kid, if I don’t do anything, you fellows will be incapable of handling them,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Eight Lightning Tribulations. These experts are finally taking action. I wonder if they are loose cultivators or men from Nine Firmaments Palace.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng considered the issue for a moment. Immediately, he swung the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand and bursts of light erupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dimensional power!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sealing power!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, ripples spread out from the space before him as layer after layer of dimensions and seals appeared to obstruct the incoming pursuers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A huge palm silhouette smashed forward to instantly smash against the barrier of one of the dimensions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, after shaking for a moment, the dimension endured.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? This Palm of Four Imagery should already be strong enough to break the defence of a Sacred artefact. Does the kid possess a high-grade Sacred artefact?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, we’ll be getting a huge harvest this time!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Put all your power into it! Hurry up and catch up to those little fellows!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Alright! Let’s go all out! Sacred Sword of Four Imagery! Strike!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the sword that the Four Old Phenoms were on shone with a dazzling light. Sword luminescence extended tens of zhang out from the sword and it broke the obstructing dimension with just a few collisions. Next, the four old men steered the sword forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The dimensions and seals that Chen Feng set up were all smashed apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After setting up tens of dimensions and seals in a row, Chen Feng was finally no longer able to hold on. His whole body felt weak and he quickly slipped back into the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Jian Xiaotian and the others were helping Lin Shaokun operate the Skysoar Shuttle. Lin Shaokun would not be able to hold on by himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Azuremist Mountain is just up ahead,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I do not know how long my actions can delay them. A pity! I am incapable of unleashing the Demon Sealing Sword’s full power, otherwise I could just kill them off,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng absorbed spiritual energy to restore his energy while keeping an eye on what was happening behind the Skysoar Shuttle. However, Chen Feng had only recovered 30 % of his power when the four old men caught up to them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you still thinking of running?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A huge palm silhouette roared forward, charging at the shuttle from behind. It exuded a terrifying and ferocious atmosphere, seemingly capable of ripping up mountains and fill the seas. In just an instant, it managed to grasp the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! Everyone, give it all you’ve got!” Lin Shaokun shouted. At that very moment, blood was already trickling out from the pores all over his body and he looked like a blood-stained man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Go all out!” The Pot Brothers forced out every last drop of power within them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword luminescence radiated out from Jian Xiaotian’s entire body as he continuously channelled his power into the Skysoar Shuttle. The Knight Yaoblade trio, knowing just how dire of a situation they were in, dared not hold back. Gritting their teeth, they pushed out all the power they possessed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Booming sounds kept ringing out from the palm silhouette grasping the Skysoar Shuttle. However, the shuttle was simply incapable of extricating itself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! How do you fellows plan on running now?” The Four Old Phenoms finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A sword beam erupted within the sky and the sword intent contained within the explosion shocked the four old men, forcing them to back away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to the sword beam, the palm silhouette grasping the Skysoar Shuttle burst apart. Next, like a falling meteor, the Skysoar Shuttle plummeted into Azuremist Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? They actually managed to break away. However, they cannot get far.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s Azuremist Mountain up ahead. It is said that there is a Human Immortal residing there!”</span></p>
