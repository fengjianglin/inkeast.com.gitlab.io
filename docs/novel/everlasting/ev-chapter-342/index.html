 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A massive bear, earthen-yellow in colour and the size of a small mountain, suddenly appeared before them. Although it did not attack, the powerful atmosphere of oppression that it was emanating pressed down on their nerves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Earthen Bear!” Jian Xiaotian cried out in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No match for it!” Chen Feng hissed through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian was quick to say it. Thus, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian – despite not having come to an agreement beforehand – bolted away in different directions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The very spot that the two of them had been standing upon just a moment ago exploded and cracks spread out into its surrounding areas.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sii! This guy is far stronger than the Wolf King.” Chen Feng flew up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are not on the same level,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Like a moving hill, the Earthen Bear that had suddenly appeared before them was at least ten zhang tall. That earthquake earlier was due to a simple stamp from the Earthen Bear. If Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had been slightly slower in dodging away, they would have been reduced into minced meat by now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Its appearance alone was shocking enough for Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, let alone its aura, which caused a chill to run down their hearts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, who were rushing up into the sky, suddenly felt a formidable pulling force coming from the ground. Their upward momentum came to a sudden halt and they fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian’s figures smashed heavily against the ground, causing two circular craters to appear as a result.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the ground trembled and large stretches of soil surged up into the sky to quickly form a gigantic, bowl-shaped earthen dome. The dome, with the appearance of a bowl, trapped Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian inside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That suction force earlier is the gravitational force of Eternal World. Unexpectedly, this yao beast could casually utilize it. It seems there is no way for us to escape through the sky,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! This big fellow trapped us in the middle. Looks like it wants to play a game of cat and mouse with us,” Chen Feng said while quickly spurring the Magnetic acupoints on his feet. A levitating power of magnetism enveloped Chen Feng’s entire body and his figure floated up, having escaped the gravitational force pressing down on him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? You are also cultivating the power of earth?” By then, the massive Earthen Bear had disappeared. Instead, a muscular and boorish-looking man with a height of three metres walked towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them knew that this person was the human form of the Earthen Bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the fellow walked closer, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian could feel the power of gravity emanating from the ground growing stronger. Finally, Chen Feng’s figure landed on the ground once more. Jian Xiaotian, on the other hand, had both his feet submerged into the soil as a result.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Say, how many Lightning Tribulations do you reckon this bear has overcome?” Chen Feng asked grimly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“At least five,” Jian Xiaotian said, clenching his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m guessing six.” After saying that, Chen Feng waved his hand. The Thunder Sword transformed into a bolt of lightning and shot towards the earthen-yellow wall of soil that was blocking their way.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunder Sword had seemingly struck a steel plate. However, the wall of soil was hundreds of times stronger than an ordinary steel plate. Chen Feng’s Thunder Sword should have been capable of easily cutting apart an ordinary steel plate, after all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Useless. Not even a cultivator with 5 Lightning Tribulations under his belt can break my earthen prison power,” the Earthen Bear said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is that so? Well, I don’t believe it!” Jian Xiaotian said as sword energy accumulated within his body. Next, holding his sword with both hands, he seemingly became one with his sword and stabbed towards the wall of soil.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The entire dome shook and clumps of soil spilled onto the ground. A circular dent had appeared on the surface of the wall of soil.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian kept howling as he mobilized the sword energy within his body, pushing himself to his limits. Even so, he was incapable of blasting through the wall of soil.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Like I said, with the level of power you two possess, charging out is impossible,” the Earthen Bear said. With a wave of his hand, the circular dent that Jian Xiaotian created with his attack earlier swiftly turned back to its former shape, smooth and unblemished.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This-” Jian Xiaotian was immediately dumbfounded. The dent that he had created with all his might had returned to its normal shape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, looks like we are in dire straits this time,” Jian Xiaotian said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not necessarily. Brother Jian, do not be discouraged,” Chen Feng said solemnly. He was secretly channelling the power of earth in an attempt to resist the power of gravity. However, his efforts could only bring about a minor bit of effect. His attainments in the power of earth was nowhere near that of the Earthen Bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Earthen Bear suddenly lifted his foot and stamped down. The aftermath caused Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian to stagger and they nearly fell to their knees.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack!” Jian Xiaotian shouted. Once again, he unleashed his ‘man and sword as one’ attack. This time, however, he attacked the Earthen Bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Jian Xiaotian’s attack, the Earthen Bear simply raised a palm, blocking Jian Xiaotian’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With his Absolute Combat Constitution, Jian Xiaotian could do battle against even a cultivator with 4 Lightning Tribulations under his or her belt. At that moment, however, his formidable sword attack had seemingly stabbed into a mountain made entirely of high-quality steel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m here as well!” As Jian Xiaotian was attacking, Chen Feng appeared behind the Earthen Bear. Brandishing Bloody Soul, he stabbed at the Earthen Bear’s back, right in the middle spot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A potent rebound power flowed through Bloody Soul into Chen Feng’s body, forcing Chen Feng to retreat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Useless. The two of you are too weak.” After saying that, the Earthen Bear lightly stamped. Next, the resulting quake caused both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian to tumble on the ground. They felt their blood roiling and their internal organs displaced. It was extremely unbearable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even more unbearable was the feeling of helplessness rising from their hearts. It was clear as day that there was too big of a difference between their two sides.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How many Lightning Tribulations have you overcome?” Chen Feng could not stop himself from asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“7 Lightning Tribulations,” the Earthen Bear said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since you are already so powerful, isn’t this action of yours that of a pure bully?” Chen Feng shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is not an act of bullying. You two are my food, that is all.” After saying that, the Earthen Bear sent his hand out in a grasping motion aimed at Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ropes made from soil emerged from the ground to quickly bind Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! We no longer have to worry about getting chased by Nine Firmaments Palace. We are going to die now,” Jian Xiaotian said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“7 Lightning Tribulations. There is too big of a difference. How unexpected! After entering the Seven Kills Direlands, I did not encounter dire killer arrays or highly venomous or unique entities. Instead, I will be eaten by a yao beast,” Chen Feng too, could not stop himself from muttering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! The two of you think you are qualified to experience the dire killer arrays? He he! You don’t know the heights of Heaven and the depths of the Earth!” The Earthen Bear sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have not eaten anything for the past few days. Unexpectedly, two tender humans would send themselves to me. Let me see, which one should I eat first.” The Earthen Bear’s gaze alternated between Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, do you have any methods of escaping?” Jian Xiaotian asked using secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“None for now,” Chen Feng replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Get ready. Later, I will utilize a secret technique that can make me 10 times stronger. Hopefully, we’ll be able to break through this soil dome,” Jian Xiaotian said, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Make you 10 times stronger?” Chen Feng was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are the after-effects?” After a moment, however, Chen Feng realized that this secret technique should be similar to the Soul Subduing Mantra that he had cultivated. There will surely be a backlash for using it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All my meridians will be broken and all internal organs will be worn out,” Jian Xiaotian replied grimly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? So serious?” Chen Feng was startled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is it? Have you two concluded your discussion? Have you fellows figured out any methods of escaping? If you fellows cannot bring out anything, I won’t hold back now.” As the two of them were secretly discussing, the Earthen Bear moved to stand before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Brother Jian. Looks like you don’t have the chance to use that secret technique to go all out anymore,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Are you planning on using that trick again? However, this situation doesn’t seem suitable for it.” Jian Xiaotian thought that Chen Feng was planning on utilizing the Soul Subduing Mantra again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, I will be feasting on you first!” After saying that, the Earthen Bear stretched his hand out to grab Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the Earthen Bear’s palm was about to grab Chen Feng’s body, a formidable power of ice and fire suddenly broke out from Chen Feng’s body and the ropes binding Chen Feng were immediately shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately after that, a red light flashed out, piercing the Earthen Bear’s body. The Earthen Bear cried out in shock and backed away. A head-sized, see-through hole had suddenly appeared on his belly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A fiery-red sword had appeared in Chen Feng’s hand. It was none other than the Fire Wyrm Sword, forged using the fangs of the Two-headed IceFire Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was a grade 9 Prized-tier sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, Chen Feng was inwardly lamenting. If the sword he brought out had been the Demon Sealing Sword, that attack he unleashed would not have simply pierced the other party. The Demon Sealing Sword, as a Sacred-tier sword, would have instantly killed the Earthen Bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua! Shua! Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sword in Chen Feng’s hand flashed and the ropes binding Jian Xiaotian were broken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng leapt into the sky. The Fire Wyrm Sword in his hand punched a hole through the soil dome above them. Next, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian charged out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!!! Humans! Where do you think you’re going?!” The Earthen Bear howled out and the soil dome exploded, transforming into countless soil fragments, which shot towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. At the same time, the formidable gravitational force grew even stronger. Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, who were soaring upwards, staggered slightly and their figures descended once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grabbed Jian Xiaotian. The body armour he wore had unleashed its power once more. The power of ice and fire circulated to assist Chen Feng in resisting the gravitational force.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, Chen Feng swung the Fire Wyrm Sword to create a sphere-shaped sword trail, enveloping both Jian Xiaotian and himself, thereby blocking off the fragments of soil shooting towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Taste my staff!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was swinging the Fire Wyrm Sword, dragging Jian Xiaotian with him when golden light suddenly shone out from somewhere nearby. Next, a gilded staff accompanied a loud shout to strike the raging Earthen Bear’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The ground, covering a radius of over one hundred zhang, shook. Shockingly, the Earthen Bear’s muscular body was smashed so deep into the soil, his figure could no longer be seen. All that remained was a large and deep crater.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian felt their bodies becoming lighter. The gravitational force that was enveloping their bodies had suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The young cultivator with the gilded staff that Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had encountered earlier suddenly appeared before them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!” Chen Feng nodded. The three of them then flew far away.</span></p>
