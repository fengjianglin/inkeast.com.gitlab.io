 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun’s aura suddenly surged and Chen Feng watched as a staff silhouette lashed out, sending a cultivator flying. As the cultivator’s body was hurtling through the sky, it split apart, causing blood and flesh to scatter all over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Lin Shaokun’s burst of fury managed to kill off one of the cultivators, his action revealed a gap in his defence. Two sword lights flashed out and two more wounds appeared on Lin Shaokun’s body. One of the attacks had nearly pierced through his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, Chen Feng knew that Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian would die if he were to tarry any longer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng wanted to rush forward, but two ferocious tigers suddenly appeared before him. The two tigers were much bigger compared to the tiger yaos that Chen Feng had encountered in the past. They had a height of two zhang and a length of three zhang each. Their sharp fangs and claws resembled swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seemingly having appeared out of nowhere, the two ferocious tigers pounced at Chen Feng, one from the left and one from the right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!” Chen Feng let out a harrumph and the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand swung out. With just one slash, the two extremely domineering tigers were cleaved into two each. However, not a drop of blood was spilled. Surprisingly, the two tigers immediately unravelled to become strands of spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, they were condensed out using primary energy,” Chen Feng said, sneering. Next, he swung and a Longevity Lance shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A soft sound could be heard as a cultivator in black was revealed. The lance that Chen Feng hurled forward could be seen piercing his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Lance exploded, instantly blowing up the cultivator in black. Even his soul power was shattered by the explosion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just a level 1 Sky Human stage cultivator. You dare come to your death?” Chen Feng said, sneering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng stretched his palm out. Next, streams of primary energy swirled upon his palm as one miniature Longevity Lance after another was condensed out. In the blink of an eye, the tens of Longevity Lances shot towards the seven cultivators besieging Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was not hoping for the miniature Longevity Lances to do anything serious. He just wanted to disrupt the actions of the cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After sending out the Longevity Lances, Chen Feng rushed forward. This time, he did not utilize the power of the Demon Sealing Sword. Instead, he utilized the Soul Subduing Mantra. Additionally, he unleashed a wide-ranged attack with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators merely smirked in the face of Chen Feng’s lance attacks. They simply did not view it as a threat. Two of them performed casual swings with their arms to obliterate all the miniature Longevity Lances that Chen Feng had sent towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, invisible ripples swiftly slipped into their minds. The Soul Subduing Mantra was a soul attack. However, it was several times more overbearing, more powerful and harder to detect compared to the average soul attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, after falling under Chen Feng’s Soul Subduing Mantra, all seven cultivators ended up staring blankly into space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was only for a short moment, not even one blink’s worth of time. However, it was enough for Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Staff silhouettes filled the sky and all seven cultivators were sent flying. Chen Feng rapidly rushed forward to capture two of the cultivators before utilizing the Demonic Heavengorging Art to utterly devour their souls.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry, run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun and Chen Feng exchanged glances. Ignoring whether or not the other cultivators were still alive, they rushed up into the sky and flew far away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, they could no longer care whether or not leaving the forest would cause them to encounter their pursuers. It was imperative that they leave immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team had spent too much time inside the forest, after all. Many cultivators had probably gotten wind of this news. Add the commotion caused by Jian Xiaotian’s Lightning Tribulation into the equation, more cultivators would come to this forest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Lin Shaokun kept flying high up into the sky. Even after reaching an altitude of 10,000 metres, they did not stop. They kept going upwards, even after reaching an altitude of 20,000 metres, only stopping after reaching an altitude of 30,000 metres. That was practically their limit. Strong winds blew at that altitude and air streams swirled about. Those with inferior cultivation bases would be incapable of reaching this altitude. Even if they could, the strong winds here would tear them apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Lin Shaokun waved his hand and a 100-zhang-long Skysoar Shuttle appeared before them. The grade of this Skysoar Shuttle was higher than all the previous shuttles that Chen Feng had seen in the past. Its only drawback was its somewhat old look. There wasn’t the tiniest hint of resplendence on the shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a Skysoar Shuttle that my master gave me. It is a top-grade Prized artefact. However, I do not use it often as it requires too much spirit stones,” Lin Shaokun said as a circular hole appeared on the side surface of the shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They made their way in. Without any overt movements from Lin Shaokun, the Skysoar Shuttle began flying forward. Its flight speed was so fast, it shocked Chen Feng. Secretly making a comparison, Chen Feng determined that this flight speed was at least ten times higher than what he could achieve when going all out. Additionally, it would appear that this was not its limit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, I do not have a lot of spirit stones on me. I hear that you have quite a bit.” Lin Shaokun was frank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. Although it is not a lot, it should be enough.” After saying that, Chen Feng brought out 10,000 Prized crystals from the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were even more Magic crystals within the Longevity Tower. However, this Skysoar Shuttle was a top-grade Prized artefact. Magic crystals would not be too useful in this regard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, let’s speed up a little,” Lin Shaokun said, waving his hand. The 10,000 Prized crystals disappeared. At the same time, Chen Feng felt the speed of the Skysoar Shuttle increasing by two notches.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s check Jian Xiaotian’s situation,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, the Skysoar Shuttle had flown past several thousand li. They did not encounter any dangers or obstructions along the way. Seeing that put the two of them at ease.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, it was not that no one had noticed the Skysoar Shuttle. Rather, the Skysoar Shuttle was too fast. Some cultivators had wanted to stop it, but were incapable of doing so. Additionally, the grade of the Skysoar Shuttle was too high. Before they could determine that Chen Feng’s team was inside the shuttle, most cultivators dared not provoke whoever was inside it. It would be terrible if they were to offend some bigshot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian suddenly spoke up. His act of opening his mouth revealed his two rows of white teeth. Those were probably the only intact places on his person. Even his eyelids were scorched black by the Lightning Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He then struggled to sit up. Shoving a handful of medicinal pills into his mouth, he began adjusting his rate of breathing. Although Jian Xiaotian’s injuries appeared quite severe, he had successfully overcome his 2<sup>nd</sup> Lightning Tribulation and his cultivation base had improved significantly. It would not take long for the wounds on his body to recover. Additionally, his cultivation base would continue to improve as well. Furthermore, Jian Xiaotian had also absorbed some of the Sky Lightning during the Lightning Tribulation process. They would prove useful for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng gradually sensed a feeling of weakness growing from his sea of wisdom. It did not take long for it to envelop his whole body. Giving a faint sigh, Chen Feng then slowly sat down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The insight acupoints within his body kept circulating and streams of power were drawn out from them. Only then did Chen Feng feel slightly better. Next, he ignored what was happening outside the shuttle and instead focused on refining and absorbing the souls he had absorbed from the two cultivators earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>On Lin Shaokun’s side, he was both controlling the Skysoar Shuttle and healing himself up. Thankfully, all three possessed extraordinary physical might. An average cultivator would have lost consciousness long ago.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun controlled the Skysoar Shuttle, quickly flying through 15,000 kilometres before coming to a halt. Then, it descended into a remote and uninhabited valley. After that, the Skysoar Shuttle shrank until it was only the size of a building and descended into a lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The fastest amongst the three to recover was Chen Feng. He had long since recovered all his primary energy. However, he had yet to fully refine the souls of the two cultivators. Additionally, fearing potential side effects, Chen Feng had repeatedly refined the souls he devoured until it reached a highly fundamental form before slowly absorbing it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The process lasted for several days. Only then was Chen Feng able to fully refine and absorb the souls he devoured. He could sense it. His soul power had doubled in strength. Even his Soulflame had grown more exuberant. Originally just a fire seedling in the past, it was now a clump of raging fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, the blackened layer of skin on Jian Xiaotian had begun falling off to reveal smooth skin. Hair had also begun growing from the once-scorched scalp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, his vitality was gradually growing stronger. Sensing that, Chen Feng knew that Jian Xiaotian had truly succeeded in overcoming his Lightning Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After turning to look at Lin Shaokun, who was focused on healing himself as well, Chen Feng decided not to bother either of them. He then flew out from the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng emerged from the surface of the lake without causing any ripples to appear. This was due to Chen Feng having opened up his Five Elemental acupoints.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His soul power spread out continuously, only stopping after reaching a radius of 1,000 metres. Next, with a thought from Chen Feng, a boulder, over 50 kilogrammes in weight, slowly floated upwards. Next, it began moving about, up and down, left and right, again and again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing this, an ordinary human would have screamed ghost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s eyes suddenly lit up and the boulder instantly exploded into powdery bits. It was as though someone had crushed it with a formidable grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, Chen Feng’s soul power continued expanding, reaching a radius of over 1,000 zhang before coming to a halt. Chen Feng could clearly sense everything happening within the range of his soul power. It was a highly wondrous experience.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a thought, his soul power slowly retracted, like a receding tide. Finally, all of them returned to his sea of wisdom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After circling around a few times, Chen Feng finally headed back into the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian were still focused on healing themselves. The layer of black skin on Jian Xiaotian’s body was still in the process of falling off. Chen Feng did not go out. Instead, he too, sat down and began cultivating himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three days later, Lin Shaokun stood up. The wounds on his body were completely healed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another three days went by and Jian Xiaotian finally opened his eyes. Two beams of light shone out from his eyes. They were seemingly capable of capturing the soul. Additionally, the aura radiating off his body was extremely strong. Sensing the power within him, Jian Xiaotian smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, congratulations on successfully overcoming the Lightning Tribulation,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is all thanks to you two, protecting me during it all, otherwise I would have died to others,” Jian Xiaotian said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, let’s head out. We’ve been cooped inside this place for a long time now,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Lin Shaokun kept the Skysoar Shuttle and the three of them flew out from the lake. Although the three of them had had to face a high number of deathly battles, the pressure they faced had allowed their cultivation bases to rise considerably. That was especially true for Jian Xiaotian, who managed to overcome his 2<sup>nd</sup> Lightning Tribulation. His cultivation base had increased several times thanks to that.</span></p>
