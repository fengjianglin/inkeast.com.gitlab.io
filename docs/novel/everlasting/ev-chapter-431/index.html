 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for the auction house to send out a middle-aged fellow to entertain Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. With a glance, Chen Feng could tell that this person had overcome 4 Lightning Tribulations. There was a wide smile on his face and his eyes shone with a dazzling light. He was clearly an astute cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am Manager Liu, representing this auction house. I hear that the two of you have Prized artefacts that you wish to auction off?” The middle-aged cultivator asked with a smile. At the same time, he also instructed his subordinates to prepare some high-grade tea and snacks for Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng nodded his head and waved his hand. A total of five magic treasures appeared before Manager Liu. Sensing the emanations coming off the five magic treasures, Manager Liu instantly got up. He stepped forward to inspect them in detail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I say, Brother Chen. Is there a need to do this just to get better seats?” Jian Xiaotian sent Chen Feng a secret vocal transmission. Naturally, Jian Xiaotian understood why Chen Feng was doing this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I won’t be using these magic treasures anyways. Selling them off is something that would happen sooner or later,” Chen Feng replied smilingly. In the beginning, Chen Feng had been lacking Prized artefacts. However, since the Pot Mountain incident, he had obtained a high number of magic treasures; most of which were Prized artefacts. There were also those he had obtained from other avenues. There were the various cultivators pursuing him. In their attempts to capture or kill him, a considerable number of Sky Human stage cultivators had died under Chen Feng’s hands. After their deaths, all their magic treasures and spatial pouches ended up in Chen Feng’s hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to that, Chen Feng was able to casually bring out some Prized artefacts for this auction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This staff is a grade 1 Prized artefact capable of poison-type attacks. This spear is a grade 3 Prized artefact, crafted using Star Vein Steel. It contains the power of tribulation lightning. Its offensive power is quite good. This flaming blade is a grade 4 Prized artefact containing solar primary flames. This sword’s blade is very fine, convenient for assassinations. It is also a grade 4 Prized artefact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This last one is a magic seal stamp containing a potent power of mountains and lakes. The force behind its attack can reach up to half a million kilogrammes. It is a grade 3 Prized artefact. Am I correct?” Manager Liu did possess quite the discerning eyes. He was able to quickly give a rough description of the five magic treasures, even their natures and grades.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Manager Liu, you have good eyes.” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha. Do you want to entrust us with auctioning these magic treasures, or do you want to just sell them to us?” Manager Liu asked smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll just sell it. Auctioning it will be too troublesome,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well. Do you want just spirit stones or some other items?” Manager Liu asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just spirit stones,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well. Now, let’s calculate the price for these Prized artefacts. This staff for 0.2 million Prized crystals, this spear for 1.2 million Prized crystals, this flaming blade and this sword for 2 million Prized crystals each and this seal stamp for 1 million Prized crystals. In total, all of them for 6.4 million Prized crystals.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you think about the price?” Manager Liu said, looking at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng nodded. He figured that the five magic treasures were worth roughly 7 million Prized crystals. He knew that Manager Liu was waiting for him to raise the price. However, he had no such intentions. Thus, he simply nodded his head and said, “Alright. I have no objections!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right! Little brother is truly a straightforward person. How about this. I will round it up to 6.5 million Prized crystals.” Seeing no attempts by Chen Feng to haggle, Manager Liu grew happy. This was quite a sizable transaction and he would be able to take a sizable cut from it. It was also enough for him to get promoted once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon enough, 6.5 million Prized crystals were delivered to Chen Feng. At the same time, he also received a VIP Card. With the VIP Card, Chen Feng would be able to get preferential treatment from the auction house. For example, there was now a private deluxe room waiting for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The private room Chen Feng entered was opulently decorated. The tables and chairs, all made from high-grade wood, had unique shapes. Additionally, they also exuded a faint aroma. Spread out across the long wooden table there was a variety of expensive fruits, snacks, refreshments and wine. There in the centre of the room was a lit crystal-clear candle. After sniffing it, Jian Xiaotian smiled and said, “This candle is made using the oil from the body of a Deepsea Overlord Whale while the wick is made from Vacant Nethergrass. Lighting it up when cultivating would allow the soul to calm down and the blood energy to flow steadily.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Additionally, there were also four slender female cultivators awaiting their instructions. With a glance, Chen Feng could see that all four of them were Concealed stage cultivators at the condensed Soulflame realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Tsk, tsk! This auction house has some means. Even for big cities, there aren’t many auction houses at this level,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There on the wall was a square-shaped jade stone. Everything transpiring within the auction floor would be shown clearly on the jade stone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. You fellows wait outside.” Chen Feng waved his hand and the four female cultivators nodded respectfully before leaving the room.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If we didn’t sell a few of those magic treasures, we would likely still be waiting inside the messy lobby,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. This place is quieter. However, I wonder what good items would come out?” said Jian Xiaotian, who reached out to grab a group of reddish grapes. Next, he stuffed one grape after another into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It doesn’t matter if there is anything good or not. We are just here to have fun.” Chen Feng smiled. For Chen Feng, although there was a considerable number of people participating in this auction, there was likely nothing that could attract his attention.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At any rate, there was a high enough number of cultivation materials within the Longevity Tower. Even if a Sacred artefact were to appear, Chen Feng would not be moved. There were a few Sacred artefacts within his body that he had yet to fully refine and master.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After waiting inside the private room for nearly two hours, the auction officially began. The raucous auction hall gradually fell silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To Chen Feng’s surprise, the first treasure to be auctioned was a 3,000-year-old knotweed root.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The knotweed root was not large, only the size of a palm. However, when it was brought out to be displayed, all the cultivators within the auction hall cried out in shock. The reason for that was because the palm-sized knotweed root had grown a human face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It looks like a knotweed root that has successfully formed its own spirit!” someone there exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! This fellow here is correct. This is indeed a knotweed root that has successfully formed its own spirit. However, someone has utilized magic powers to seal its spirit inside. Everyone knows that knotweed roots are like ginsengs, containing a great deal of supplementary energy. It doesn’t matter if you use this 3,000-year-old knotweed root to concoct medicinal pills or take it as it is, you will be able to increase your cultivation base and life span,” the auctioneer in charge explained loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A 3,000-year-old knotweed root is indeed a good spiritual herb!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If I take it, I should be able to gain tens of years’ worth of strength!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It just so happens that I am planning to concoct a Spirit Accumulation Pill. I am just lacking a highly supplementary ingredient. I want this knotweed root!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He Yaozi, I have also taken a fancy to this knotweed root. I think it’s better for you to let me have it. The Cyan Vine Technique that I am cultivating is already about to level up!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Stop fighting, guys. We should check out the starting price for the knotweed root first!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! They are bringing out a spiritual herb of this level out right from the start. Looks like this auction house has quite the foundation,” Chen Feng said, chuckling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the knotweed root was quite good, it was not much in Chen Feng’s eyes. There was an uncountable number of spiritual herbs within the Longevity Tower. A considerable number of those herbs were thousands of years old. In fact, some of the top-grade spiritual herbs there were over 5,000 years old. As such, this knotweed root was not essential for him. Naturally, Chen Feng was not one to begrudge having too many spiritual herbs. If the price of the knotweed root was reasonable, he would buy it up and plant it inside the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had discovered that, the more spiritual herbs there were inside the Longevity Tower, the stronger the Longevity Tower’s vitality would become. Additionally, due to the Longevity Tower’s aura, herbs and grasses would grow much faster within the Longevity Tower compared to the outside world.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The starting price is 10,000 Prized crystals. Each bid increment is set at 100 Prized crystals. Now, begin your bids!” the auctioneer shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, this knotweed root is quite good. Taking it would increase a person’s vitality, reducing ten years’ worth of hard work,” Jian Xiaotian said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, if you are interested in it, you can bid for it.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! I am just saying. I cultivate the sword dao. Spirit stones work for my cultivation as well,” Jian Xiaotian said, waving his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“10,100!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators within the hall began bidding. However, it would appear that they were only testing the waters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“10,500!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“11,000!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“12,000!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The price kept rising. On the other hand, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were like young masters from affluent families, eating fruits and sipping fine wine as they leisurely observed what was transpiring inside the auction hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha!” Jian Xiaotian suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was puzzled. He did not understand why Jian Xiaotian would laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are currently being pursued by all the cultivators of the Northern Plains. Unexpectedly, we can still leisurely enjoy ourselves here,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is only temporary. I have this feeling that if we want to go to the Central Plains, we will have to face a series of battles,” Chen Feng suddenly said, his voice grim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! It doesn’t matter how many enemies there are, they are free to come. My sword intent needs polishing,” said Jian Xiaotian, his body exuding a will to fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I bid 20,000!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the two of them were conversing, the price for the knotweed root kept rising.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the number of people fighting for it has grown scarce. No matter how precious the knotweed root may be, there was still a limit to its worth. Once the price exceeded the limit within the minds of some cultivators, they would give up on it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“30,000!” Suddenly, Chen Feng spoke up, his voice travelling through the wall of the private room and into the auction hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was the first time a cultivator from the private rooms had spoken up. At any rate, for those cultivators with identities and power, this spiritual herb was no match for even one Earthen-tier medicinal pill.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The auction hall fell into a momentary state of silence. Then, someone bid again. “I offer 30,100!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“40,000!” Chen Feng was very direct in his bid.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, no one stepped forward to compete with Chen Feng. Everyone knew that cultivators who could stay inside the private rooms were all extraordinary characters. Moreover, this was just a spiritual herb. There was no need to go all out for it. Most importantly, the value of the knotweed root was only that much. Any higher and they would be overpaying for it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Where did this country bumpkin come from? Has he never seen anything before?” Some of the cultivators within the other private rooms secretly scorned Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are there any other bids? 40,000 Prized crystals! Any other bids?” the auctioneer began shouting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unfortunately, although there were countless cultivators inside the auction hall, no one else made a bid for it. Thus, the knotweed root was smoothly delivered to Chen Feng’s hands.</span></p>
