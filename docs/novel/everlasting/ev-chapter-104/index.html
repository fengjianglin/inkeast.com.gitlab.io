 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing the shouts coming from afar, the cultivators from Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court were immediately stunned. After around two breaths’ worth of time, cultivators from both sides roared out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who is it? Who leaked this matter out?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going on here? Could someone have discovered this immortal mansion?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! Someone is trying to create havoc. Just who could it be?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Despicable! Damn them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those people should be stabbed a thousand times!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every cultivator from Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court bellowed furiously. Some of them could not stop themselves from radiating their furious energy outwards. A few of them, the more dextrous ones, flew into the sky to quickly head towards the source of the shouting voices. It appeared they were attempting to find out who the other party was in order to torture the other party.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After less than one joss stick’s worth of time, the cultivators that Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court sent out returned and they reported what they found.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We did not find the initiators. Instead, we saw many cultivators flying towards Blackwind Marshes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is not looking good. Many of the cultivators within Blackwind Marshes and its surroundings have been roused. Almost every one of them are searching around.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is really not looking good. Some cultivators are approaching!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Utterly despicable! Just who was it who leaked this news? If I ever find that person, I will definitely flay that person!” said someone from Sword Tower through gnashed teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Judging from the voices earlier, there seems to be three people in total. Their shouts came from three different directions. The other party knows what they are doing. They must have planned this properly.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two factions did not simply stop. Instead, the leaders of the two factions quickly met up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is your Sword Tower’s opinion on this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a huge opportunity. Should news of this spread out, even the combined efforts of Sword Hall and Jade Talisman Sect cannot stop the incoming change. Do not forget, there are a total of 10 great immortal dao sects in our Northern Plains.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thankfully, we had been quick in relaying news about this back. As of now, we can only hope that reinforcements can come quickly.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. We should dispatch our men out quick. If anyone approaches, kill them on the spot!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right! We’ll do just that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Both Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court immediately dispatched out some cultivators who flew out from the restrictive barrier. They began killing off any approaching cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court found an immortal palace in Blackwind Marshes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court are fighting each other over an immortal grotto-mansion in Blackwind Marshes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“An Immortal artefact is emerging from Blackwind Marshes! There are also plenty of Dao artefacts and countless Sacred artefacts! Everyone, hurry up and go snatch!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, Ye Ziming and Lu Ta’s voices spread out once more. This time, they spread even farther compared to earlier, echoing strong despite having spread beyond tens of li into the distance (1 li = 0.5 km).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just who? Damn them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I really want to smash them into pieces!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The leaders from Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court were so furious smoke was practically rising out from their seven orifices. Their rage was comparable to clapping thunder, but there was nothing they could do.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Chen Feng had changed his location several times. He was floating high up in the sky, a pure white jadestone hovering right before him. Every time he shouted, the jadestone would absorb his voice before releasing them again, several fold in intensity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This jadestone that Ye Ziming gave me is quite special. It can actually magnify sound by several times. It must be the function of the magic array within it,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? Someone’s coming!” Peering into the distance, Chen Feng hastily descended to hide inside the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon enough, three young cultivators riding flying swords arrived at the spot where Chen Feng was hovering earlier. Then, they began searching the place using divine senses. However, Chen Feng had already condensed out his Soulflame. Thus, his soul power was far stronger compared to them. After searching for a moment, the cultivators gave up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The voice earlier seemed to have originated from this spot. A pity, we can’t find anyone.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder, are they telling the truth? Or is this a prank?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whether it is true or not, we can just go check it out for ourselves. If there is really a legendary immortal mansion, this will be a great opportunity. Even though our cultivation bases are shallow, getting just one immortal medicinal pill is good enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, let’s go recruit some other loose cultivators and head forward together. After all, Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court are not to be trifled with.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Even if they are not to be trifled with, in face of immortal serendipity, we can throw our lives away! Why fear them?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After discussing for a moment, the three cultivators swiftly left. Not long after their departure, more cultivators appeared one after another. Through Chen Feng’s observation, the cultivators were all at the Concealed stage. The most powerful amongst them was only at level 5 of the Concealed stage. That cultivator had not even condensed out his Soulflame.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The levels of those cultivators are too low. I fear they will be no match for Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court. Hopefully, more people will come.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Having reached that line of thought, Chen Feng hurriedly flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Glancing around, he saw two cultivators swiftly approaching from the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellow cultivators, please wait!” Chen Feng called loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you?” The ones Chen Feng stopped were two cultivators at level 2 of the Concealed stage. They regarded Chen Feng vigilantly. Soon, however, they relaxed because they saw that Chen Feng was only a level 1 Concealed stage cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I am just a loose cultivator who came to Blackwind Marshes on an adventure. Earlier, I heard something regarding an immortal mansion. I wonder, how much do you fellows know about it?” asked Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We too, came after hearing the news. You have been here longer than us. You should know more than us,” said one of the cultivators. He was a young cultivator with a gaunt and tall stature.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I heard that an immortal mansion appeared within the Blackwind Marshes area up ahead. I believe it must be true. Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court have occupied the place and are immediately killing off any cultivators who gets close. My companion was killed by cultivators from Sword Tower. Luckily, I could escape with my life.” Chen Feng began fabricating his story.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There really is an immortal mansion?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators exchanged glances as they exclaimed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Sword Tower and Jade Talisman Court are being too overbearing. Even if an immortal mansion appears here, it is not their property. Treasures will be gained by those with virtues.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right, right! However, despite their overbearing nature, they have numbers and power on their side. If we rush in, they will definitely silence us. The way I see it, since we loose cultivators are not affiliated with any sects or factions, the amount of power we can field is too little. However, we can join forces. The higher our number, the more power we will have. When the time comes, we can just swarm forward and share the spoils,” suggested Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This suggestion is quite good. Let’s do it. Eh? There are some people there. Hurry, let’s go join up with them.” Hearing Chen Feng’s suggestion, the eyes of the two cultivators quickly lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time they entered Blackwind Marshes, there were 13 cultivators beside Chen Feng. The strongest amongst them possessed a cultivation base of level 5 of the Concealed stage. As for the others, they were mostly at level 1 and 2 of the Concealed stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Blackwind Marshes is just up ahead. The wicked astral winds inside are very powerful. Ordinary humans will be utterly eroded inside. If any of you cannot endure it, hurry up and retreat so that you don’t end up losing your lives,” said the middle-aged, level 5 Concealed stage cultivator grimly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are prepared. Besides, if we do lose our lives for the sake of immortal serendipity, we can only say its bad luck on our part. In life, overcoming tribulations such as these are necessary,” said a level 2 Concealed stage cultivator. Next, a dark-yellow stream of light flowed out from his body to cover his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh! A grade 4 defensive-type Magic artefact!” someone nearby exclaimed. Some others revealed looks of envy. Even the level 5 Concealed stage cultivator did a double take.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Most of the cultivators there were loose cultivators. Without any opportunities, they would have to practice through trial and error on their own. It was safe to say they had no cultivation techniques, magic treasures or medicinal pills. For some of them, 10 years of bitter cultivation cannot compare to just 1 year of cultivation by a disciple from some immortal dao sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to make a name for themselves in the cultivation world, medicinal pills, magic treasures and cultivation techniques were the most important tools to have. Medicinal pills were the equivalent to food for ordinary humans. After stepping into the Concealed stage in the path of cultivation, they can no longer eat food from the mundane world. Otherwise, their bodies will be filled with impurities. How could they continue cultivating in the future? How could they advance? In order to keep progressing without falling behind, they can only keep taking medicinal pills, a great number of medicinal pills. High-grade medicinal pills! The most important thing in the path of cultivation was medicinal pills. If the mark of wealth for the mundane world was gold and silver, the mark of wealth for the cultivation world was medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, if they could cultivate up to the ‘live through breathing’ realm, they shed off the need to eat medicinal pills for food. However, that was a very high realm, something that none of these cultivators could achieve. Moreover, even cultivators at the ‘live through breathing’ realm require medicinal pills to advance. However, the medicinal pills they consume would be at a much higher tier. For example, Sky-tier medicinal pills or the legendary Immortal-tier medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Magic treasures were cultivators’ weapons. With just a firewood axe in hand, an ordinary human would be capable of killing off wolves. They could even kill mighty warriors. As for cultivators, with magic treasures in hand, their strength would multiply and they would be able to even kill those at a higher level than them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for cultivation techniques, they were the foundations of cultivation and the way for cultivators to keep growing stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Everyone there had put up a layer of protection over their bodies. Some created shields using external discharge of primary energy, some utilized magic treasures and some utilized secret techniques.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to avoid rousing their attention, Chen Feng rode on a grade 2 flying sword. Ray after ray of sword light shone from the flying sword to form a large cocoon around Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The moment they entered Blackwind Marshes; Chen Feng felt tens of powerful astral winds blowing at him. The astral winds were formed from wicked energy, each possessing abnormal sharpness. They seemed to possess a tangible quality, as though they were sharp blades forged out of iron. The astral winds ravaged the sky. Should ordinary humans venture inside, they would be sliced into pieces instantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, Chen Feng was greeted with the sounds of colliding metals. The sword light protecting his body swayed for a bit before regaining stability.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible! The astral winds here are truly formidable!” Chen Feng exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We have only just entered. You will get used to it soon enough. Besides, there are some places within Blackwind Marshes that are calm. Such violent wicked astral winds do not blow in those places,” the middle-aged cultivator beside him said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>True enough, after flying forward through a distance of tens of li, Chen Feng got used to it. Although the pressure was still there, the wicked astral winds could not break Chen Feng’s sword light defence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, a hurricane, faint-black in colour, descended from the sky to immediately suck in one of the level 1 Concealed stage cultivators. The cultivator had no time to even cry out before the sudden hurricane sucked him in and he disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, get down and move on foot. The wicked astral winds up ahead are getting stronger. Additionally, there will be large hurricanes,” said the level 5 Concealed stage cultivator. Clearly, he had been inside Blackwind Marshes before and was familiar with the terrain.</span></p>
