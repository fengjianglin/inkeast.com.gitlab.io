 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the lack of hesitation on Chen Feng’s part to attack them, Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu immediately grew terrified.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wait!” the two of them said simultaneously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Do you two have anything else to say?” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Aren’t you curious to know why we followed you?” Zhao Qiang said, releasing a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is no need for that. There are no one else here. By killing you two, I can put an end to this issue and no one will know that I killed you two. Maybe you two were killed while tracking the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters?” Chen Feng sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Killing us will not benefit you. The sect will definitely find out about this. If you kill the heir disciples of the sect, not even escaping to the ends of the world would save you,” Ma Wu shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll think about it when the time comes.” A clump of primary energy had condensed out within Chen Feng’s palm. It crackled, bursting with power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am a member of the Zhao Family! You dare kill me?” Zhao Qiang shouted loudly, his face pale.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Zhao Family? You know Zhao Quan?” asked Chen Feng after a moment’s consideration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Zhao Quan is my younger cousin. We were following you because Zhao Quan had mentioned that you are a spy. If you kill me, the Zhao Family will know. If you offend our Zhao Family, you will suffer a fate worse than death. I advise you to let us go. We can forget about this matter. If not, you will suffer the consequences of your actions,” Zhao Qiang said, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Zhao Quan again. So, that’s what this is all about. No wonder these two have always been looking at me weird</span></em><span>. Chen Feng came to understand the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right, I forgot to tell you fellows. The thing I hate most is to have others threaten me.” Chen Feng stared at both Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu as he snickered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you want to do?!” Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu instinctively felt a foreboding sensation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm who was lying beside them raised his head. His horn abruptly sent out two purple beams of light, which pierced right through Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu’s foreheads.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their eyes stared straight into the sky. After having cultivated for so many years, they never expected to die here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their souls were destroyed and their Soulflames were shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng sighed. He had disappeared for such a long time for no good reason. He feared it might rouse suspicions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, when he returned to the small town, he saw that his appearance did not attract anyone’s attentions. He did not sense any movements either. Only after a good part of the day had passed did a few disciples anxiously come looking for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Chen, something has happened,” said one of the disciples with a nervous tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened? Could those monsters have appeared again?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. The two captured monsters have somehow disappeared. Additionally, Senior Brother Zhao and Senior Brother Ma have disappeared as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is that so? Come, let’s go check it out.” Chen Feng was surprised. He already knew about Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu. However, the disappearance of the two Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters puzzled Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Back then, they had beaten up the two Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters until they were on the verge of death before locking them up. There was no way the two of them could mount an escape on their own. Thus, there was only one other possibility. Other forces were at work here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Did the other Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters or Phantom Beasts come rescue those two Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng speculated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect no longer had to work hard to cut out Starlight Stones, recent events had put an even greater level of stress on them. Every day, they would gather together in terror, fearful that those bloodthirsty monsters would re-appear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was especially true after the disappearance of two heir disciples. They grew even more panic-stricken and some suggested returning to the sect immediately. They all believed that returning to Extreme Celestial Mountain was the safest option.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No one is allowed to leave without permission. That is a violation of the sect’s rules,” shouted the heir disciple in charge of the little town. He hoped to deter those other disciples who were on the verge of going mad.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t leave? Should we wait for our deaths here?” someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. What are you heir disciples doing? Even the two captured monsters could escape. If we keep staying here and those monsters come, can you fellows protect us?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As if. The way I see it, they won’t even be able to protect themselves.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Facing the shadow of death, the outer disciples kept shouting out, their words growing more belligerent with time. Finally, even the inner disciples joined them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shut up!” The heir disciple snapped out coldly and a powerful soul power spread out. All the disciples there felt their hearts growing tense and a chilling sensation ran down their hearts. They subconsciously stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, hold on for just a few more days. The sect will be sending experts here soon. When the time comes, they will find those bloodthirsty monsters and kill them all.” After saying that, the heir disciple quickly left. Regardless of what might happen, this incident had happened under his charge. When they return to the sect, he will surely be held accountable for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two days later, Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu remained a no-show. However, the reinforcements sent by the sect had arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were only three people. However, the Extreme Celestial Sect disciples in the small town breathed a sigh relief each.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Three elite disciples came this time. Surely, they will be able to capture those bloodthirsty monsters.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Only three people came. Isn’t that too little?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you know? Those are all elite disciples. Each of them is at level 8 of the Concealed stage or above. One of them could defeat hundreds of us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Level 8 of the Concealed stage. Aren’t they close to reaching the Sky Human stage?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The three of them appear aloof. However, their cultivation bases are truly powerful. I am actually incapable of determining their states. It seems I will have to be careful so as to not attract their attention</span></em><span>. Chen Feng secretly inspected the three of them. However, he dared not go too far with his inspection for fear that they would notice his actions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I wonder what abilities the three of them possess?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>What happened next went beyond Chen Feng’s expectations. After finding out about their abilities, Chen Feng immediately felt a crisis enveloping him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After circling around the little town a few times, the three elite disciples then arrived at the spot where the disciples had faced off against the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters that night. Although that placed had been cleaned up, there were still some bloodstains there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of the elite disciples brought out a small, palm-sized, circular mirror. It was unknown just what materials were used to create the circular mirror. It contained thick spiritual energy. The elite disciple utilized his magic power to operate the mirror and it released a soft and misty ray of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Teeming with spiritual energy, it was quickly obvious that it was no ordinary magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The elite disciple began chanting while his other hand kept forming magic seals. Next, the light shining out from the small, circular mirror swiftly covered the ground as it swept over the places that had once been a battle site.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the elite disciple channelled his magic power, the circular mirror in his hand began to reveal images upon its surface. A careful look revealed that it was the scene of Chen Feng and the other disciples fighting against the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters from a few days ago.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The small mirror, which was teeming with spiritual energy, could actually replay the events that occurred back then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it is the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. Eh, even a Phantom Beast. Why did these demonic creatures appear here? Could there be something here?” the elite disciple uttered in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Look at that disciple.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was then that the three of them noticed someone within the images shown on the mirror. After having suffered from the Phantom Beast’s sneak attack, the disciple remained unscathed. In the end, he even managed to smash the Phantom Beast down into the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That person was Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This fellow does not look familiar. Is he also an heir disciple?” Pang Ban, the one holding the mirror, turned to look at an heir disciple standing beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior brother, that person is Chen Feng. He is an outer disciple,” said the heir disciple reverently. When there were no elite disciples around, he was the boss of this place. At present, however, he could only reply obediently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Call him,” Pang Ban said in a hushed tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Have you fellows ever seen such a powerful outer disciple?” Pang Ban asked with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Phantom Beast’s sneak attack could directly kill off an heir disciple. Even for guys like us, the sneak attack would have sent us into a panicked state. However, this outer disciple appeared completely unharmed. Additionally, it is obvious that he was not going all out in the battle.” The elite disciple speaking was known as Liu Yu. He was also a very powerful fellow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s just capture him when he comes. He is most probably a spy from another sect,” said the third elite disciple with a somewhat rude voice. His name was Zhao Xiang; he was also a member of the Zhao Family.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No hurry. He is not necessarily a spy. We can discuss this further after he comes,” Pang Ban said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for the heir disciple to bring Chen Feng over. Seeing the three of them, Chen Feng felt odd. He did not understand why the three of them would call him over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Could they have realized something?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The small mirror transformed into a stream of light, which flew into Chen Feng’s palm before re-forming its original shape. On the surface of the mirror was the scene of Chen Feng fighting the Phantom Beast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that brought great shock to Chen Feng’s heart. Outwardly, however, he revealed nothing, not a single expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What is this thing? It could actually recreate events from the past?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is the Thousand Seeker Mirror, it is a tracking-type magic treasure,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you have to say?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave of his hand, Pang Ban summoned the Thousand Seeker Mirror back. Then, he asked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t know what you are taking about.” Chen Feng answered coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Insolence! A minor outer disciple like you dares to speak to us with such a tone?” Zhao Qiang reproached.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough. No matter what his rank may be, we are all working for the sect. Besides, it would appear that this junior brother’s cultivation base is quite good. Hopefully, you can contribute some more next,” Pang Ban said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Pang Ban channelled his magic power once more and the surface of the Thousand Seeker Mirror in his hand flickered ceaselessly. Finally, a few red dots appeared on the surface of the mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. I found the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters.” With a wave of his hand, Pang Ban then flew into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, let’s go hunt those monsters together,” Zhao Qiang said coldly as he looked at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right.” Chen Feng nodded his head and followed the three as they flew high up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was flying, he contemplated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I did not expect them to possess such a magic treasure. This is truly problematic</span></em><span>. Chen Feng complained to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thousand Seeker Mirror was capable of recreating past events and search for traces of the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. If so, it would not take them long to discover the scene of him fighting against the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. That was not the most problematic issue. At most, the three of them would find out that he possessed Prized artefacts. The biggest problem would be of them finding out about him killing Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu. Should that happen, not only could he not continue on as an outer disciple from Extreme Celestial Sect, he would also end up facing the murderous pursuit of this super powerful sect.</span></p>
