 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Someone came here to raise a ruckus. He is definitely after Brother Chen.” Luo Kong and the others had noticed the fight. Luo Kong, possessing the most temperamental character, had wanted to rush forward. However, Shui Yan, who was beside him, stopped him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do not be impulsive. The other party is after Chen Feng. They must be well-prepared. Right now, only one person has revealed himself. Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun are enough to deal with him. We should focus on protecting Chen Feng so as to avoid letting others take advantage of an opening,” Shui Yan said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shui Yan is right. We should be vigilant of our surroundings,” Zhou You said, bringing out his Asura Blade. At the same time, he spread out his soul power to envelop the entire valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful!” Shui Yan shouted out and immediately attacked. A sword beam – condensed with the power of water and fire – shot to the spot behind Zhou You.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Zhou You was quick to respond. As Shui Yan was attacking, he too, sent a slash to his back. He was confident that, if someone was behind him, his attack would find its mark.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Zhou You and Shui Yan were quickly disappointed. Their attacks missed and a rapidly spinning hurricane swiftly charged towards the valley. Its objective was Chen Feng, who was still cultivating himself within the valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Li Lang, Zhan Jin and another two disciples rushed forward. Standing side by side, they stopped the hurricane.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who is it? Who dares come here to die?” Li Lang said, slashing out with his sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Stop him!” Shui Yan’s team of three exchanged glances and they charged forward as quickly as they could.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hu! Hu! Hu! Hu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the formidable hurricane swept towards Li Lang and the others. In the face of the hurricane, Li Lang and the other disciples, cultivators with several Lightning Tribulations under their belts, were all sent flying backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wind-type magic!” Even Shui Yan’s team of three had to exert themselves to stop the formidable hurricane.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After stopping Shui Yan and the others, the hurricane spun towards Chen Feng at an even greater speed. When there were only 10 more zhang between the hurricane and Chen Feng, the hurricane suddenly transformed into a large palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crystal clear, light flowed across the surface of the palm. Surprisingly, the palm was condensed entirely with the power of wind. Despite its weak appearance, it contained a power capable of tearing mountains and cracking the earth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The huge palm shot towards Chen Feng with a grasping motion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! There are still others lurking around!” Both Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian were shocked. Unexpectedly, a more powerful figure had revealed itself to attack Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian were entangled by Lei Sha. They were incapable of getting away from him. The two of them could already be considered as highly powerful figures. Despite his cultivation base at level 1 of the Sky Human stage, Jian Xiaotian was strong enough to kill off a level 3 Sky Human stage cultivator. Lin Shaokun was even stronger, capable of challenging a level 5 Sky Human stage cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An ordinary level 4 Sky Human stage cultivator would have died to the two of them long ago. However, this opponent was a genius from Nine Firmaments Palace. Although Lei Sha was only at level 4 of the Sky Human stage, he was able to take on the two of them. In fact, he was occupying an advantageous position in the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the palm was about to capture Chen Feng, a mighty force erupted upwards from Chen Feng’s body like an erupting volcano. The force ripped the palm apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>During that critical moment, Chen Feng finally opened his eyes. He had completely condensed his domain power and broken through to his 8<sup>th</sup> sea of wisdom layer to formally enter level 8 of the Concealed stage. A violent power filled his body and he could feel his cultivation base rising beyond his control.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It just so happened that Chen Feng was in need of a place to vent this power. Unexpectedly, someone had chosen to attack him, giving him an avenue to unleash the power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the palm exploded, a young cultivator in white tumbled down. His face was ugly to behold and he cut quite the wretched appearance. It would appear that Chen Feng’s attack had caused him to suffer quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Feng Lang from Nine Firmaments Palace!” Shui Yan recognized him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Lei Sha, Feng Lang! You two dare to raise a ruckus here in our Extreme Celestial Sect? Are you looking down on our Extreme Celestial Sect?” Shui Yan shouted loudly and his voice spread far away. Any cultivator within a radius of several hundred li would hear him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Naturally, we have our reasons for attacking.” Lei Sha laughed loudly. In the beginning, the fight between Lei Sha and Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun had seemed equally matched. However, Lei Sha’s attacks suddenly grew fiercer. He used 30 % of his strength to keep Lin Shaokun at bay while using 70 % of his strength to unleash his skills against Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Jian Xiaotian from the Central Plains and Chen Feng from Extreme Celestial Sect are our Nine Firmaments Palace’s targets of eradication,” Lei Sha shouted, ignoring the fact that he was inside Extreme Celestial Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You dare show such arrogance? Everyone, attack together! Capture them and let them know that Nine Firmaments Palace is not the strongest sect in the Northern Plains,” Shui Yan said grimly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng had already broken through, his power soared and his domain abruptly spread open to charge towards Feng Lang. It seemed as though Chen Feng had the upper hand. Thus, Shui Yan and the others swarmed Lei Sha.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of so many opponents, Lei Sha fell into a disadvantageous position. Lin Shaokun became the greatest threat he faced. Lin Shaokun’s gilded staff shot out and the sky became filled with staff silhouettes. It did not take long for one of the staff silhouettes to smash into Lei Sha’s body, sending him flying over 100 metres away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Lei Sha finally managed to steady himself, the others pounced upon him once again and bashed him up with a flurry of attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Does Extreme Celestial Sect like to win using numerical advantage?” The earlier attack from Lin Shaokun had wounded Lei Sha considerably and he felt upset.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s still better than your Nine Firmaments Palace’s actions of executing sneak attacks,” Shui Yan retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! I am not from Extreme Celestial Sect.” Lin Shaokun simply laughed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After unleashing his attack, Chen Feng did not stop. Instead, he continued attacking ferociously. His domain charged furiously, forming various types of attacks. Domain of Eight Trigrams, development of the myriad entities. At that moment, Chen Feng found that he had an uncountable number of attacks to dish out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Feng Lang’s cultivation base was high, his carelessness led to him getting wounded. At that moment, Chen Feng’s tempestuous attacks made it so he was incapable of steadying himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A moment’s carelessness led to Feng Lang getting pulled into Chen Feng’s domain. Palms formed using wind and lightning slapped about, gigantic rocks rained down from mountains and lakes, chains made from water and fire whipped about, Heaven and Earth encaged him. Various attacks kept assailing Feng Lang.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Now this is a real domain</span></em><span>. Chen Feng could feel it. His casual attacks contained a power unlike anything he had ever unleashed in the past. He did not even need to utilize his Sacred artefact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After reaching level 8 of the Concealed stage and condensing his domain power, Chen Feng had grown 10 times stronger. Additionally, Chen Feng also knew that his growth had yet to stabilize. After some more time, his power would rise by a whole 16 times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Inside Chen Feng’s domain, Feng Lang’s attacks were all greatly suppressed. The wind attacks that he sent out were easily shattered by Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A mountain shot out to slam Feng Lang, sending him flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, chains made from the power of water and fire swiftly tied up his four limbs. Both of Chen Feng’s hands moved swiftly and a lance – flashing with lightning bolts – swiftly appeared in his grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!” Feng Lang could feel an intense crisis descending upon him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was about to skewer Feng Lang, a cultivator in black suddenly emerged from the void above the valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a flash, the black-clad cultivator appeared before Chen Feng. He stretched both hands out and tore furiously, tearing a massive rift within Chen Feng’s domain. Next, with a grasping motion, the chains binding Feng Lang were broken, causing popping sounds to ring out. After regaining his freedom, Feng Lang quickly escaped from the domain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Who? So strong!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was highly shocked. The absurdly powerful domain that he had condensed out was so easily torn by this cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a thought from Chen Feng, his domain power quickly condensed to form a massive palm, which grasped at the black-clad cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black-clad cultivator responded with a grasping motion of his own. Surprisingly, he was able to tear Chen Feng’s palm silhouette into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>An expert!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Knowing that he was facing an extremely formidable opponent, Chen Feng immediately brought out the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact!” The eyes of the black-clad cultivator glinted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, before the two of them could engage in another fight, a sharp sword beam shot down from the sky. It was like a bolt of lightning, but abnormally dextrous. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived before the black-clad cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Retreat!” The black-clad cultivator and Feng Lang simultaneously backed away. Their bodies fluttered to retreat 100 metres away in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Without making a sound, a seemingly bottomless hole had appeared on the ground and a chilling sword energy seeped out from the hole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. If it isn’t Yan Luo from Nine Firmaments Palace. And here I was wondering who could be so arrogant as to raise a ruckus in our Extreme Celestial Sect.” Jian Kongming laughed as he floated downwards, Ming Tianfeng beside him. He had been the one to send out the sword beam earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Jian Kongming, you think you are a match for me?” The black-clad cultivator, Yan Luo, sneered. There was an icy expression on his face. It seemed as though he did not consider these two newcomers as a threat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Let’s put that question to the test,” Jian Kongming said smilingly. He abruptly stretched five fingers out at Yan Luo and five sword beams shot out. The five sword beams were of five different colours. Surprisingly, that was the Five Elemental Sword Beams.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They shot out in five different directions, blocking all of Feng Lang and Yan Luo’s retreat paths.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Jian Kongming’s attack, Yan Luo simple scoffed. He swung and a stream of black flames shot out from his palm. His palm swung about quickly to catch all five of the sword beams to break them apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have long since heard of the might of your Earthen Mara Flame Formula. Unexpectedly, I would get such a good opportunity.” Jian Kongming swung his hand and a transparent sword appeared in his grasp. He aimed the sword at Yan Luo from afar and a formidable sword intent charged towards Yan Luo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! You actually got to him first. In that case, I can only step back and take on the small fry,” Ming Tianfeng said, his figure dashing forward to leave a series of after-images in the air. Next, he arrived before Feng Lang.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you calling a small fry?” Feng Lang felt infuriated and wind power swirled around his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ming Tianfeng waved his hand and a Lightning Essence Talisman erupted outwards. The power of the talisman was so great that it managed to affect the wind power surging across Feng Lang’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is said that Ming Tianfeng from Extreme Celestial Sect has acquired the treasure trove left by some Immortal Humans and is extremely wealthy. I will experience how true that statement is today!” Streams of wind surged across Feng Lang’s hand to quickly form a seemingly indestructible wind sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I will let you experience it.” Ming Tianfeng swung both hands and streams of light flowed out swiftly, creating a dazzling scenery to behold. The streams of light were powerful talismans of varying attributes. Although they had yet to unleash their powers, Feng Lang could already sense danger.</span></p>
