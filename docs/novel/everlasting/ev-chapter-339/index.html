 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, congratulations on getting a good magic treasure,” Jian Xiaotian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Jian Xiaotian was speaking, Chen Feng secretly observed him. He found that Jian Xiaotian was truly sincere. There was no falsehood in his actions. Thus, Chen Feng knew that this person was worth befriending.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come. There shouldn’t be any more powerful firewasps left inside the hive. Let’s go check it out.” Chen Feng smiled and made to keep the fire sword. At any rate, his Fire Trigram acupoint had gotten loose. Thus, he planned on refining this sword and using it to safeguard the acupoint once it was fully open.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was about to put away the fire sword, his hand suddenly shook as the fire sword abruptly split into eight fire swords once again. The fire swords surrounded Chen Feng and unleashed a wave of disorderly attacks before flying into the hive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the attacks left Chen Feng flustered, he was unharmed. However, the fire sword had flown away on its own, causing him to feel embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Brother Chen’s body armour is quite good,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If not for this armour, my body would have been split into seven or eight pieces long ago,” Chen Feng replied with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was then that a humanoid creature, wreathed in flames, slowly walked out from the hive. With a beckoning hand, it caused the eight fire swords to combine once more to form a sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like tasting the fire nectar will not be easy.” Chen Feng shook his head while chuckling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! I didn’t think there could be such a powerful firewasp. No wonder the hive could reach such a massive size. Looks like this firewasp is in no way inferior to the Wolf King.” Jian Xiaotian placed his great sword on his shoulder and the will to fight radiating from his body grew stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was the special attribute of the Absolute Combat Constitution. It did not matter if the owner was wounded or whole. Should a fight erupt, the will to fight would soar out from the owner’s body to unleash his or her strongest power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The flaming humanoid was covered entirely with blazing flames. However, its facial features were distinctively clear, looking no different from a normal human. It possessed the appearance of a handsome young man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This big, flaming firewasp is very strong. I wonder how many Lightning Tribulations it has overcome,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll find out once we fight him!” After saying that, Jian Xiaotian strode forward, the great sword in his hand pointing at the humanoid firewasp. Several sword beams shot out from the sword and spun towards the humanoid firewasp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The humanoid firewasp swiftly swung the fire sword in his hand, causing a fire dragon to charge out. Not only did the fire dragon devour Jian Xiaotian’s attack, it also charged towards Jian Xiaotian. At the same time, the humanoid firewasp brandished his fire sword as he charged towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the humanoid firewasp was flying forward, two broad wings suddenly appeared on his back. By flapping those wings rapidly, his flight speed rose to extreme heights and Chen Feng felt as though the humanoid firewasp had become a blur in his eyes. In a flash, he had appeared before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>So fast! It is comparable to the Wolf King!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Both of Chen Feng’s hand furiously shot out to create a mirror-like shield of water in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The humanoid firewasp used the fire sword in his hand to cut the water shield into fragments. However, the cut fragments suddenly released fiendishly icy water vapour. Additionally, they were very cold, causing the fire sword to turn dim for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The power of fire and water clashed, causing a thick layer of mist to suddenly appear. At the same time, a series of explosions could be heard. Both of Chen Feng’s hands were swinging non-stop as one Longevity Chain after another kept shooting out to attack the humanoid firewasp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, Chen Feng had actually used Vile Fountain Water to create the water shield. It did more than just stop the humanoid wasp’s attack. Its power of water managed to erode the humanoid wasp as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I wasted a drop of my Vile Fountain Water. Hopefully, that move would prove useful,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought as he continued his attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of snapping sounds rang out as the Longevity Chains that Chen Feng shot out were all cut into pieces. Next, a fire dragon opened its jaws and surged forward to devour Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A little insect wants to transform into a fire dragon?” Chen Feng gritted his teeth and brought out two drops of Vile Fountain Water. One of the two droplets exploded and the formidable power of water immediately extinguished the fire dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the other droplet of Vile Fountain Water, Chen Feng transformed it into a water arrow and sent it smashing against the humanoid firewasp’s body. As a result, the flames radiating from the humanoid firewasp’s body turned dimmer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Skywheel Shattersword!” By then, Jian Xiaotian had already finished off the other fire dragon. Thus, he sent a sky-encompassing number of sword beams towards the humanoid firewasp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were fighting the humanoid firewasp, some other firewasps emerged from the hive. However, they were all lesser subordinates, lacking in terms of cultivation bases. It was all they could do to stay afar and shout words of encouragement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like this is the Wasp King. After dealing with this fellow, the hive is ours,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, this fellow is not to be underestimated. Be careful.” Chen Feng was secretly preparing to use more droplets of Vile Fountain Water to deal a powerful blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, Chen Feng was inwardly feeling distressed. The Vile Fountain Water was too valuable. He did not have much left on him. And yet, he would have to waste quite a bit of them this time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their two sides exchanged blows for another ten rounds before Chen Feng could find an opening for the attack. A simplistic-looking water bomb formed using Vile Fountain Water struck the humanoid firewasp’s body and exploded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, under the formidable might of the power of water, the flames radiating from the humanoid firewasp’s body were utterly extinguished. Jian Xiaotian took advantage of the opportunity to bat the humanoid firewasp away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, however, a red beam of light flashed out to pierce Jian Xiaotian’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” Chen Feng swiftly rushed forward. He condensed out a Palm of Five Elements to press the humanoid firewasp down the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Be wary of his stinger!” Jian Xiaotian quickly shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The red beam of light flashed out once more, plunging towards Chen Feng’s chest. Despite his attempts to dodge, Chen Feng felt his chest quaking and his figure was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng’s figure flipped in the sky and he dashed back. Bloody Soul shot out from his hand to nail the humanoid firewasp to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A two-metre-long stinger, wreathed in flames, circled the sky once before falling to the ground. At the same time, the fire sword too, fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian trudged forward and unleashed a cleaving strike to cut the humanoid firewasp into two. Flames burst out and the humanoid firewasp returned to its original form, a two-metre-long firewasp. Although its body had been cut into two, it continued to struggle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a big firewasp.” Chen Feng stepped forward to pick up the firewasp’s stinger. It was heavy while a potent power of fire flowed within it. The cut portion of the stinger released icy waves of coercion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We finally killed off the Wasp King,” Jian Xiaotian said with a bitter smile. A bloody hole had appeared on his shoulder, but no blood flowed out. The power of fire from the stinger had cauterized the meridians and flesh on the wound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, are you all right?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I got careless. I forgot that firewasps have this trick.” After saying that, Jian Xiaotian pressed the wound on his shoulder. Next, the wound began twitching. It did not take long for the wound to close up. Although the bloody wound had disappeared, Jian Xiaotian’s face turned pale instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! I failed to catch up to the Wolf King and was instead stung by a big wasp,” Jian Xiaotian said, laughing out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had only just uttered those words when a nearby piece of ground suddenly exploded. The Wolf King transformed into a silvery beam of light and shot towards Jian Xiaotian. Unexpectedly, the Wolf King had been hiding nearby, waiting all this time to unleash its attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian, who had only just finished healing up his wound, did not even have the time to resist. All he could do was watch as the Wolf King descend upon him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, one Longevity Chain after another burst out from the ground to block the Wolf King. Additionally, a glittering, gold-coloured net descended to wrap up the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was not all. The Lofty Mountain Seal descended as well to smash into the Wolf King’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! I already knew that you were lurking around. Unexpectedly, you actually decided to show your face.” Chen Feng sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Jian Xiaotian had recollected himself. The great sword in his hand hacked down forcefully, decapitating the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! Brother Chen, thanks. I had actually failed to notice that this guy was lurking nearby,” Jian Xiaotian said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them quickly dealt with the corpses of the two Great Yaos before heading towards the massive hive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the Wasp King die to Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, the remaining firewasps had fled, leaving the massive hive behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian arrived before the hive, their surroundings suddenly turned cool. The high temperature there had instantly plummeted. After sensing around, Chen Feng realized that the hive itself was not hot. Only the peripheral areas of the hive would constantly radiate flames. Additionally, there was a spot in the centre of the hive that would constantly absorb the power of fire from the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk! Looks like this massive hive is more than meets the eye. This fire sword must be a product of this hive. Not to mention, the surface of the hive is filled with magic arrays. It can constantly absorb worldly spiritual energy. From another perspective, this hive can be considered a living object,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was analysing the hive, Jian Xiaotian found a passageway to enter the hive. It did not take long before Chen Feng heard Jian Xiaotian’s voice coming from inside the hive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, hurry! Come look!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng hastily entered and was immediately greeted with a thick scent of sweetness. Jian Xiaotian was pointing at a certain spot filled with small holes. Fiery-red, crystal-clear fire nectar flowed out from the holes to gather within a pond, several zhang square in size. The fire nectar exuded an alluring aroma which caused Chen Feng to salivate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So much fire nectar. This is good stuff!” Jian Xiaotian opened his mouth and sucked, causing a stream of fire nectar to flow into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk!” Jian Xiaotian tasted the fire nectar, revealing an intoxicated expression. Finally, he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng brought out a spirit stone and dug a hole, turning the spirit stone into a bowl. Stepping forward, he then scooped up a bowl and slowly tasted the fire nectar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A stream of fire nectar entered his mouth. First, he felt a smooth and fragrant feeling spreading throughout his mouth. Next, a wave of hot energy flowed through his meridians to envelop his whole body. After some time, Chen Feng opened his mouth and exhaled a fragrant breath. His mind felt refreshed and he felt his exhausted vigour recovering. It was even growing, albeit slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good stuff! It really is good! Not only is its taste the best, it can even improve one’s abilities!” Chen Feng praised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who knows many years these firewasps spent accumulating this fire nectar? Unexpectedly, their actions ended up benefiting us in the end,” Jian Xiaotian said with a smile. After the fire nectar flowed into his belly, his pale face turned ruddy once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
