 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As expected, it is the aura of ancientness. The space here is very firm. Even the laws of this place are stable. If it weren’t for that, this place could not have continued to exist after a battle took place here.” The Longevity Tower suddenly flew out to hover before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, can you find the Immortal artefacts here?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As long as they exist.” The Longevity Tower transformed into a stream of light to instantly disappear from Chen Feng’s view.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As there was a connection between the Longevity Tower and Chen Feng’s mind, the Longevity Tower was like an extension of Chen Feng’s body. The Longevity Tower flew quickly to instantly cover a distance of over 50 kilometres. Next, it abruptly descended, smashing through the ground, causing rocks and sand to scatter about. A deep crater, with a radius of over 100 zhang, appeared on the ground. There was no way to tell just how deep the hole went.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Strands of chilling energy then wafted out from the hole before finally becoming like an erupting volcano, surging upwards. Only, it wasn’t searing lava surging upwards, but instead…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s an Ice Crystal mine! There are even Ice Crystalcores inside it!” Chen Feng blurted out in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As it turned out, the Longevity Tower had sensed the Ice Crystal Mine the moment it came out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ice Crystals were a type of ice-type crystal. The concentrated power of ice and water contained within them made it so cultivators could use them as spirit stones. More importantly, cultivators would not suffer from cultivation deviation after absorbing the spiritual energy within the Ice Crystals.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, there were other uses for it as well. For example, artefact forging, refining and pill concoction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At present, the Longevity Tower was devouring them all to replenish its energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower shook slightly and a formidable suction force immediately enveloped the Ice Crystal mine. Next, vast amounts of ice-type energy howled as they were all devoured by the Longevity Tower. In just a few breaths’ worth of time, the Longevity Tower had devoured them all. After that, the ground, with the Longevity Tower as its epicentre, began collapsing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the Longevity Tower’s increasing power, Chen Feng smiled. <em>With the Longevity Tower in hand, I will surely be able to gain a lot from this place.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower transformed into a stream of light, which flowed into Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, this is a battlefield left behind after a battle between Immortal Humans. Although there are some fragments of magic treasures here, there are more dangers. Since there are dangers, this will be the best chance for you to hone yourself. As such, under normal circumstances, I will not be taking action. You will have to handle everything by yourself.” Tower snickered. Clearly, he was feeling happy after devouring the Ice Crystals earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What constitutes as normal circumstances?” Chen Feng asked with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Normal circumstances mean there is nothing that stirs my appetite.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng shook his head and brought out a jade talisman. It was a Sensor Talisman. Inserting his soul power into it, he began sensing his surroundings. This was something that they had prepared before entering. Upon entering the ancient battlefield, they would quickly look for their companions and gather up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Going at it alone in this unfamiliar place was too dangerous. Be it the threat from the dangers here or the cultivators from other sects, grouping up was better than going solo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Sensor Talisman in Chen Feng’s hand scanned his surroundings, reaching a radius of up to 500 kilometres. However, Chen Feng was quick to frown. He could not sense Liu Quan and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>They split us up too far away from one another</span></em><span>. Chen Feng was surprised. More, he could not believe it. He was even feeling suspicious. At any rate, there were ten plus people in his group. To think that he could not be able to sense even one of them after using the Sensor Talisman. It meant that they were very far away from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Hopefully, nothing bad happened</span></em><span>. After considering it for a moment, Chen Feng strode forward and began investigating his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>We can stay here for one year. After that, even if we crush the Teleportation Talisman, it would not do anything. Naturally, if we encounter any dangers, we can choose to exit this place in advance</span></em><span>, Chen Feng considered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, if I stay here for longer than one year, would you be able to bring us out?” Chen Feng asked Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Hearing Tower’s answer, Chen Feng felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the rocky desert was filled with rocks, it was still flat terrain. Thus, by channelling his eye power, Chen Feng was able to clearly see up to several hundred li ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! This place is really flat and silent. Not even the shadow of a ghost can be seen here.” Chen Feng shook his head helplessly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had only just said that when the ground abruptly erupted and the rocks there became like flying swords as they shot towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng dared not make light of the situation. Swiftly, he backed away. At the same time, he reached out with his hand and grasped. All the incoming rocks ended up in his grasp. Next, they were all pulverized.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A blade silhouette pounced, arriving before Chen Feng. Next, a mote of starlight expanded before Chen Feng and the icy sensation of death assailed him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Displaying the Kirin Steps, Chen Feng left a series of after-images on the ground before disappearing from sight. Next, his figure re-appeared over 1,000 metres away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A creature that Chen Feng had never seen or heard of had appeared before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The reason he thought of it as a creature was because he could not be certain if this was a yao beast, demonic beast or some other creature.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A creature, looking like a lizard and black-grey in colour, was lying on the ground. On its pointed head was a singular dark-red eye, which stared right at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The creature was only one zhang long and its entire body was covered in a layer of slime, which shone with a faint lustre. It had eight stubby feet covered in scales and upward-curving spikes, also flashing with chilling light. It was a somewhat terrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this? The combination of a pangolin and a lizard?” Chen Feng was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is a Demonic One-eyed Lizard. This creature does not exist within Eternal World. It is only natural for you to not know about it,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Demonic One-eyed Lizard. It is a demonic beast?” Chen Feng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You can consider it a demonic beast. However, no one will object if you call it a yao beast. At any rate, yaos and demons are a family. He he! Unexpectedly, you are so lucky. To think that you would bump into this creature right from the start. I’ll give you a warning. This creature is a social creature.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Social creature!” Chen Feng’s eyes lit up and he abruptly leapt into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The moment his figure leapt into the sky, the ground burst apart as two more Demonic One-eyed Lizards attacked Chen Feng, one from the left and one from the right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These fellows have quite the decent mastery of the earthslip technique. Additionally, the auras on their bodies have merged as one with the lands. I failed to notice them earlier</span></em><span>. An interested look appeared on Chen Feng’s face. With a wave of his hand, tens of sword beams were fired out. At the same time, he dashed towards one of the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s at breakneck speed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of ringing sounds rang out and the sword beams that Chen Feng fired out were only able to create sparks after making contact with the Demonic One-eyed Lizards’ bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Impressive!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was taken aback. The sword beams he fired out earlier could have easily sliced apart Mystic Iron.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a kick, Chen Feng then sent one of the Demonic One-eyed Lizards flying through a distance of several hundred metres. After smashing down onto the ground, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard struggled for a bit before lying still.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The kick from Chen Feng contained a force of up to 5 million kilogrammes. Despite the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s astonishing level of defence, the kick from Chen Feng had still shattered its vitality.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After successfully killing off one of the Demonic One-eyed Lizards, Chen Feng gained a better understanding of them. What happened earlier had proved that these creatures were very easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, several more Demonic One-eyed Lizards ended up dying to Chen Feng’s punches and kicks later on. Seeing that, Chen Feng grew more at ease. Landing on the ground, he stamped his foot and waves of yellow-coloured, earthen fluctuations spread outwards. Then, everything went still and no more Demonic One-eyed Lizards appeared.,</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Can these guys also be considered as social creatures?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng pursed his lips to the side. Next, he reached out with his hand, grasped and shook. One of the Demonic One-eyed Lizards’ corpse was cut open. Finally, a dark-red gem flew into his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>No yao core or demon core. Only this eyeball. It should be useful for something, right?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng then proceeded to pluck out the eyes of the other Demonic One-eyed Lizards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! This fellow is not stupid after all. Those eyeballs are the essence of the Demonic One-eyed Lizards. Additionally, they also have some other functions. Hey, hey! Kid, the main part of this show has yet to come!” Tower sat on one of the Domain Tree’s branch, watching everything that was transpiring outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Are all the creatures here so weak?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng felt puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, however, Chen Feng felt his vision blurring and a slight bout of dizziness assailed his mind. It was very light, but it instantly alarmed him. The Lifebound Flame within his sea of wisdom swiftly burned to dispel the uncomfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was then that the ground suddenly erupted and fine rocky chips blasted about to engulf Chen Feng. At the same time, black silhouettes flew about through the rocky chips, all shooting towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>More and more Demonic One-eyed Lizards appeared, every one of them becoming a stream of light as they darted about. At the same time, Chen Feng’s vision blurred again. However, he activated his Magic Eyes of Darkness and his eyes flashed with dark light, allowing him to see everything before him clearly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword of Wind and Lightning!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Sword appeared in Chen Feng’s hand and he unleashed sword beams of wind and lightning to swirl around him. A series of colliding sounds rang out and the surrounding Demonic One-eyed Lizards were all sent flying. Two were killed in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng advanced, one step at a time. He kept swinging his sword and sword beams reigned about, hacking apart everything in their path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Strange, what was that earlier?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was someone who had cultivated out the Magic Eyes of Darkness. Even so, he was still feeling out of sorts. Cultivators that had yet to cultivate out an eye technique would have fallen unconscious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It must be a soul attack. Are there other creatures hiding around? If that is the case, I should be able to detect them</span></em><span>. Chen Feng grew more puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His eye technique operated and his soul power, within his sea of wisdom, roared. Chen Feng dared not be careless about this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demonic One-eyed Lizards attacked again. The Longevity Sword in Chen Feng’s hand promptly pierced out to stab into the eye of a Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sound of a crystal breaking rang out as the tip of the sword broke through the eyeball. Next, the vitality of the Demonic One-eyed Lizard utterly disappeared. It then fell to the ground with a plop, becoming like a dead mutt.</span></p>
