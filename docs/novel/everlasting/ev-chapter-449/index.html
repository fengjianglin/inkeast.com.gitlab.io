 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened? What is going on here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad! The nine-storey tower earlier is a very powerful magic treasure. We are now trapped inside it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What artefact tier is this magic treasure at? Even our Sacred artefacts are feeling fearful. Could it be a Dao artefact? Or perhaps, an Immortal artefact?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After trapping the bandits, Tower retracted some of his aura. Thus, the kneeling bandits were able to get up. Even so, their three Sacred artefacts were still shivering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who cares what artefact tier it is at? All I know is that things are not looking good for us now. If we cannot charge out, all of us might die here,” the middle-aged scholar said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Utilize the Sacred artefacts together! I don’t believe we cannot charge out,” said the young cultivator wielding the Sinister Demonwind Flag.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We have no choice but to go all out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After getting enveloped by the Longevity Tower, the bandits realized that they were in trouble. Following a brief discussion, they pushed forth the strongest amount of power they could muster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mouthful after mouthful of blood essence were sprayed out from each of the bandit’s mouth. All of the blood essence then converged before falling upon the three Sacred artefacts. The Sacred artefacts, which had lost the will to fight earlier, began exuding strands of aura.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ignite the blood essence!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ignite the blood essence!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng! Weng! Weng! Weng! Weng! Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their invisible soul powers began fluctuating wildly and they began flowing like rivulets, converging upon the three Sacred artefacts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ignite the soul!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ignite the soul!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ignite the soul!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was an abnormally impressive sight. The bandits from Skycloud Mountain were using such an extreme method to stimulate their powers in order to empower the three Sacred artefacts. Even if they were to succeed in overcoming their current predicament, their cultivation bases would plummet. It was something that would require a long time to recover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the soaring blood energies secretly shocked Chen Feng as well. If he were not within the Longevity Tower, he would have turned tail and run. Even so, Chen Feng was feeling concerned. At any rate, there were so many Sky Human stage cultivators burning their life force. This power they created with their actions could destroy a 10,000-zhang-tall mountain. Although the Longevity Tower was extraordinary, Chen Feng was not feeling too confident.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry! Let me show you my power.” Tower snickered, not viewing the bandits’ actions as a threat. Rather, he allowed them to continue gathering their power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, thanks to the all-out efforts from all of the bandits to empower them, the three Sacred artefacts recovered their atmosphere of majesty. Slowly, they hovered up and rays of light began shining out from them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng! You still have a chance! Let us out, otherwise we’ll both face mutual destruction!” the insidious-looking man suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mutual destruction? Ha ha ha ha ha! What a joke! No matter how you look at it, this is more like moths flying into flames. How can you call this mutual destruction?” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, do not blame us for attacking together! Everyone, attack. Attack together, use all your powers to empower the Sacred artefacts and kill Chen Feng,” the insidious-looking man said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. Sinister Demonwind Flag, attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Starsource Sword, break through!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Skysoar Warship, smash through!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Sinister Demonwind Flag was ghastly and sinister, the Starsource Sword was invincible and the Skysoar Warship was massive in size. The three Sacred artefacts formed the ‘</span><span>品</span><span>’ formation to charge towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, it’s up to you now.” Chen Feng did not possess the ability to fight against an attack of this level. Thus, he could only rely on Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Relax. This is a piece of cake.” Tower snickered again. Clearly, he did not have a high evaluation of the incoming attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the three Sacred artefacts were about to arrive before Chen Feng, Tower abruptly extended a palm out. Next, the palm rapidly expanded in size. Light flowed to radiate a glossy, faint-yellow shine across its surface, which was covered in patterns. Countless runes flashed across the surface of the palm. Like the hand of a Heavenly God, the palm silhouette then pressed down against the three Sacred artefacts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even before making contact with the palm, the aura they sensed coming from the palm caused the three Sacred artefacts to tremble. Fear. Submission. Finally, they fought. Not against the palm, but against the control of the bandits from Skycloud Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We lost control! How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad! Give it everything you have, fight to the very end!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t have anymore power left. I have burned up almost all of my blood essence!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If so, burn it all! Better to fight to the death than die here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The bandits went mad in their attempts to fight back. Even so, they could not turn the situation around. The huge palm silhouette kept pressing down. Finally, the three Sacred artefacts began wailing and they swiftly shrank. As they shrank, so too did Tower’s palm silhouette. Finally, the three Sacred artefacts shrank to a length of three inches each before flying into Tower’s palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Three Sacred artefacts collected in such an easy manner?” Chen Feng was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right. It is that easy.” Tower responded with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That move you used just now is the Great Longevity Palm, right?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, that is right. You noticed? When you have overcome Lightning Tribulation, you will be able to use it as well,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. The three Sacred artefacts are already ours. Now, time to deal with these fellows,” Tower said as he once again displayed the Great Longevity Palm. This time, the Great Longevity Palm was even greater than before. Lightning flashed and thunder roared across the surface of the palm. The power of water and fire melded with one another and various runes kept flashing out. This huge palm silhouette, containing a higher level of ferocity, pressed down against the bandits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The pressure created by the incoming palm caused those with lesser cultivation bases to explode, reduced into a mist of blood. The essence and energies within were absorbed by the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! Mercy, mercy!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! I can do anything! I can be your cow! I can be your horse!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, I beg you! Don’t kill me! Cultivating to this level has not been easy. I don’t want to die!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the suppressive might imposed by the Great Longevity Palm, the remaining cultivators knelt down and begged for mercy. There were also some who fell limply to the ground as they wetted their pants.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng could not bear seeing it. Just as he was about to speak up, however, Tower snickered and said, “What, kid? Are you getting soft-hearted? That won’t do. If you let these fellows off, they will definitely expose your whereabouts. Besides, we are just killing off a few fellows. As cultivators, the number of people we will be killing in the future will only grow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“To be facing indecision and an irresolute mind at this juncture will affect your future path of cultivation. Back when I was fighting others, numerous cultivation worlds were destroyed as a result. Ha ha ha! When I think about it, I have taken an uncountable number of lives!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All the bandits with cultivation bases beneath the Sky Human stage were killed. Their flesh, soul and even the magic robes they wore were disintegrated. By then, only Ling Long and the others remained, fighting bitterly to resist. They all knew that it was absolutely impossible to escape. In the face of the approaching palm silhouette, all they could do was to shout as loud as they can.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, don’t kill us! We were in the wrong. As long as you let us go, we will do whatever you want us to do!” the middle-aged scholar screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, forgive me. I can do anything for you!” Ling Long said with a pained but tempting tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, you demon! No wonder Nine Firmaments Palace wants to hunt you down. You cowards! If we die, then we die! What is there to fear?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t wanna die! I have only just overcome my 6<sup>th</sup> Lightning Tribulation! There is the possibility of me assailing the Human Immortal stage. I still have a lifespan of several thousand years. I cannot die like this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I also don’t want to die. I have only lived for 200 years. I don’t want to die!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the incoming wave of killing intent, they began screaming again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A pity. I also don’t want to kill you fellows. You can only blame yourselves for offending me. Normally, I would have spared your lives. However, I cannot do so right now,” Chen Feng said, gritting his teeth as he waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three level 2 Sky Human stage bandits exploded simultaneously to become a mist of blood and the magic treasures on them fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! Chen Feng, you demon! Even if I become a ghost, I will not let you go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When you die, your souls will perish. You fellows cannot become ghosts.” Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good, kid! Your mind must possess this level of resolution. Kill them all,” Tower said, putting more power into the move. Immediately, several more Sky Human stage bandits exploded into a mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, you must not kill me. I know you want to leave the Northern Plains. I am a manager from Heavenly Origin Trade Association. I have ways to help you leave the Northern Plains. You cannot escape Nine Firmaments Palace’s pursuit!” the insidious-looking man suddenly screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Chen Feng’s heart gave a thump. He swiftly grasped with his hand and the insidious-looking man was grabbed up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You wait here,” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh!” After having gotten out from the predicament, the insidious-looking man opened his mouth and he panted heavily for breath. His entire body was soaked with sweat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng! I must not die too! I can be your slave; I can be your woman!” Ling Long shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, I have a good relationship with one of the elders from Nine Firmaments Palace. I can have Nine Firmaments Palace let you go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng scoffed inwardly. Those cannot even be considered a reason to let them live.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One after another, Ling Long and the level 4 Sky Human stage bandit exploded into a mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I know of a danger zone! There might be an Immortal artefact there!” Xiao Jian, who had remained silent all this time, suddenly cried out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! Interesting. You don’t need to die.” Before Chen Feng could say anything, Tower had already made his move. With a wave of his hand, Xiao Jian was grabbed up as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t kill me! I know the whereabouts of an Immortal artefact!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I know the location of a spirit stone mine!”</span></p>
