 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Hong was already on the verge of losing control over the yao beast to begin with. Unexpectedly, the Iron Cage would be pierced, creating a hole there. Seeing the Yao King on the verge of escaping, was there any wonder that Mo Hong would grow furious?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, the cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace knew just how ‘helpful’ his action was. Despite his embarrassment, he shouted, “What is there to fear? So what if it can escape? We have two Sacred artefacts. Can we not handle one ape?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As if it’s that simple. Using the Iron Cage earlier has already used up all of my power. Hurry up and leave. I will not be able to hold it in any longer!” Mo Hong shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Yao King’s body was continuously growing in size. In the beginning, the Yao King had only managed to stretch its palm out. By now, however, half of its body was already outside. Additionally, the Iron Cage was shaking violently as well. It would appear that Mo Hong would not be able to hold on any longer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace did not leave. Instead, he brandished his spear, a Sacred artefact, to continue attacking the Yao King. Although he was incapable of unleashing its full power, the spear was still very sharp. One spear silhouette after another pierced forward to leave wound after wound upon the Yao King’s body. Blood kept flowing out and the temperature around them began rising. It was due to the energy contained within the Yao King’s blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wounded, the Yao King roared furiously. Its arm swung to catch the spear. Next, its body swelled and the gap on the Iron Cage grew bigger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry up and run away!” Mo Hong shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace gritted his teeth. Next, he sprayed out a mouthful of blood essence onto the spear, causing it to spin rapidly. Blood flew about and the Yao King could no longer maintain its hold on the spear. Thus, the cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace was able to retrieve his spear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Hong swiftly sent out two hand seals and the Iron Cage quickly flew towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, no! Hurry up and run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Despicable!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Instantly, Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin realized Mo Hong’s intentions and they bellowed furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Open!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Hong yelled and the Iron Cage broke open. The Yao King broke free and roared as it pounced towards Chen Feng’s team of three. This Yao King had been trapped and wounded just moments ago. Thus, it was presently in a state of fury. Now that it had managed to break free, it promptly pounced on the cultivators closest to it. In order to vent the rage in its heart, the Yao King planned on ripping all the cultivators before it to shreds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! I want to see how you plan on surviving this!” His plan a success, Mo Hong reflexively grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin fired out their flying swords. It was impossible to escape from this Yao King’s attacks. At that very moment, all they could do was to fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the Yao King’s opinion, one pounce and a few swings were all it would take to shred Chen Feng’s team of three. Furthermore, that was exactly what the Yao King did. Every drop of its rage and killing intent burst out, aimed directly at Chen Feng’s team of three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humans, die!” Since making its appearance, this was the first time this Yao King had spoken up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng did not use the Fire Wyrm Sword because he knew that not even the full might of the Fire Wyrm Sword would be capable of stopping the Yao King’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Chen Feng brought out the Demon Sealing Sword, which he had not used in quite a while. It was a grade 6 Sacred artefact, something that most Sacred artefacts would be incapable of matching up against.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demon Sealing Sword was swung to fire out a sword beam. Like a huge bubble, it then enveloped the Yao King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had activated the Demon Sealing Sword’s sealing power. Thus, the Yao King’s body turned stiff and it fell motionlessly to the ground, a look of dread on its face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demon Sealing Sword was swung once again. This time, its attack was not aimed at the Yao King. Instead, it was aimed at the distant Mo Hong and his team.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A sphere of astral lightning abruptly exploded, transforming into tens of motes of light, which then flew towards Mo Hong’s team. Seeing Chen Feng pin down the Yao King with just one move, Mo Hong and the others were quick to realize that things were not looking good for them. They wanted to flee but Chen Feng’s attack had already arrived. Thus, Mo Hong spurred forth all of his power to empower the Iron Cage, placing it in front to defend him. Likewise, the Purple Firmaments Palace’s cultivator brandished his spear to create sky-encompassing spear silhouettes. Although they were both wielding Sacred artefacts, their magic treasures felt unreliable in the face of Chen Feng’s attack. The coercive atmosphere of might emanating from the sword in Chen Feng’s hand was simply too powerful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Iron Cage placed before Mo Hong instantly exploded and the sky-encompassing spear silhouettes created by the Purple Firmaments Palace’s cultivator completely disappeared. The two of them cried out wretchedly as they were knocked backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After knocking the two fellows backwards, Chen Feng did not stop. He swung the Demon Sealing Sword again and astral lightning kept bursting out to attack the other cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin watched in shock as cultivators were killed one after another. Not even cultivators at level 6 of the Sky Human stage could block Chen Feng’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What grade is the Sacred artefact at?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Chen is actually so strong.” The two of them stared blankly, not knowing what to say.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Chen Feng’s attacks, some of the cultivators there were killed, some were wounded and some were forced to flee. As Chen Feng was planning to kill them all, he suddenly felt a bout of weakness overcoming his entire body. With that, he knew that he was at his limit. Thus, he stopped attacking and watched as the other cultivators fled as far away as they could. Even some of the cultivators who remained alive struggled to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s mind shifted and he sensed signs that the sealed Yao King was about to break free. Thus, Chen Feng began moving towards the Domain Tree. As he did so, he said, “Senior brothers, you two should leave this valley now. It would be better if you stay far away. Something will be happening soon!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin looked at Chen Feng. They wanted to say something, but finally they nodded their heads vigorously before swiftly moving out from the valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The fleeing cultivators had only just escaped from the valley when they were surrounded by apes. They watched in horror as the apes rushed over from every direction. Although the apes were only at the Great Yao stage, there was a high number of them, over 100 in fact. Under normal circumstances, they would have been capable of fighting against the apes. At that moment, however, they were all wounded. Some were in fact suffering from injuries so severe that they could barely breathe. How could they fight against these apes? In just the blink of an eye, several of them were ripped apart by the apes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng! Our Skypond Faction will never forgive you for this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Jade Talisman Sect will begrudge you forever!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! Save me!” the cultivators shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Sister Bai, save me!” Liu Shaolong, his body completely stained in blood, rushed out. Although he was still alive, he was already on the verge of dying. Disregarding the many injuries on his person, one of his arms was already ripped out. More importantly were the three apes chasing after him. Without any assistance, death would surely claim him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing Liu Shaolong’s cry for help, a trace of hesitation flashed across Bai Yunyan’s face. She was deciding whether or not to take action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is no need to bother with someone like him.” Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin happened to run past Bai Yunyan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Sister Bai, save me! We are partners!” Seeing Bai Yunyan not doing anything, Liu Shaolong shouted again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a sigh, Bai Yunyan finally took action. A stream of light, which was seemingly condensed using white clouds, sent the pursuing Great Yaos flying. Then, another stream of light, which looked like a ribbon, pulled Liu Shaolong over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thank you, Senior Sister Bai! Thank you!” Liu Shaolong thanked her again and again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t thank me first. I can only help you this much. Whether or not you can survive after this will depend on yourself.” After saying that, Bai Yunyan’s figure slowly floated upwards and she flew to another distant valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Bai Yunyan leave, a look of exasperation glinted across Liu Shaolong’s eyes. However, he said nothing. More Great Yaos were rushing over. By then, Liu Shaolong had realized that his previous estimate was a mistake. The number of Great Yaos here had exceeded his original estimate. Forget collecting spiritual trees, it would be difficult for him to even escape from the place right now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, are you confident that you can collect this Domain Tree?” asked Chen Feng as he moved forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not a problem. Although my strength has taken a hit recently, collecting this small tree won’t be an issue,” Tower said confidently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Small tree? It’s hardly small. The other spiritual trees that we’d encountered along the way are not even one tenth the size of this Domain Tree,” Chen Feng replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you know? The small that I am talking about refers to Domain Trees, not the other spiritual trees. This Domain Tree is only 330 zhang tall. I have seen Domain Trees before in the past. Do you know how tall those Domain Trees are? 5,000 kilometres, 50,000 kilometres, half a million kilometres… he he, it’ll shock you to death!” Tower said arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Braggart! A tree that is half a million kilometres tall? Do you take me for a fool?” Naturally, Chen Feng did not believe Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! That isn’t even the biggest one. There is this Domain Tree somewhere within our universe that is a good half a trillion kilometres tall. Enough, let’s not talk about that. When you are finally capable of leaving this Eternal World, you will understand just how big the universe is,” Tower said disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was moving forward, two bolts of lightning shot out from the branches to strike Chen Feng. He waved the Demon Sealing Sword to break the bolts of lightning to pieces, but the incident caused him to pause.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Such power!” Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One wind blade after another carved their way through space to attack Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Fireballs, water arrows, offensive blasts containing the power of mountains and lakes kept raining down from the top of the tree in an attempt to kill Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then kept the Demon Sealing Sword. With a thought, the semi-transparent silhouette of the Longevity Tower emerged from his body to envelope him. Striking the surface of the semi-transparent silhouette of the Longevity Tower, the attacks became like ox figurines tossed into the ocean, disappearing without making a sound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the protection of the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng easily walked up to the Domain Tree. Looking at the tree, which was like a small mountain, Chen Feng found himself at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only after standing before the Domain Tree could Chen Feng clearly see that the surface of the tree was not smooth. Various types of peculiar-looking runes had been inscribed upon the surface of the tree. Power flowed through each rune and Chen Feng knew that the tree contained a highly concentrated domain power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng had successfully approached the Domain Tree’s trunk, it stopped attacking Chen Feng. Slowly, Chen Feng’s figure floated upwards, only stopping after he was on one of the tree’s branches.&nbsp;</span></p>
