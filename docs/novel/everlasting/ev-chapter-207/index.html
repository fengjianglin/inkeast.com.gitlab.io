 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, someone had made it out from the immortal mountain. This was even more shocking compared to news of someone entering the immortal mountain. After a brief moment of silence, everyone there roared out. A few amongst them were fast to react and they rushed towards the three young cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Clearly, the three young cultivators who emerged from the immortal mountain did not possess high cultivation bases. However, the fact that they managed to emerge from the immortal mountain meant that they must have had some fortuitous encounters. Who knows? Maybe they possessed an Immortal artefact. Even if that were not the case, any item acquired from within the immortal mountain, even a grain of sand, could be a good item.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Should we make a move?” Lu Ta asked in a hushed tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Only a fool would make a move. I will not make a move. Even if the three of them do possess Immortal artefacts, there are too many cultivators and experts here. Even if I do manage to snatch over the items, there is no guarantee we could make it out. Besides, it seems the three of them did not gain anything from the immortal mountain,” Chen Feng replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the crowd swarm towards them, the three young cultivators reacted. They flew up into the sky simultaneously, wanting to quickly leave the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unfortunately, the three young cultivators’ cultivation bases were only average. Furthermore, it would appear that they also lack any backing. How could characters like them rush out from the encirclement? In merely two breaths’ worth of time, the three of them had been surrounded by the cultivators there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, three of the surrounding cultivators simultaneously made their moves. Those three were not attacking to kill. Rather, they wanted to capture the three young cultivators alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, before the three attackers could capture the three young cultivators, the other cultivators beside the attackers made their move as well. Surprisingly, they were not attacking the three young cultivators. Instead, they wanted to stop the three attackers. Thus, the situation devolved into a state of chaos.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These three belong to our Jade Talisman Sect!” one of them shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Your Jade Talisman Sect is worth fart! Our Sword Hall has taken action! Whoever dares compete with us will be making an enemy of Sword Hall!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Hall may be powerful, but our Nine Firmaments Palace is not afraid of you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Skypond Faction was the first to notice these three fellows.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Horseshit! No matter what, our Extreme Celestial Sect will be taking one of them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, the people shouting were from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. When members of the other lesser sects noticed the situation, they quickly stopped their actions. This was no laughing matter. In the Northern Plains, the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were peerless existences. Offending just one of them would result in sect extermination for those lesser sects. At that moment, however, all ten of them were there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The scene immediately turned chaotic. It became a place where members of the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects fought one another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I didn’t think there would be so many disciples from our Extreme Celestial Sect here. Senior Brother Luo, will you be stepping forward to help?” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Forget it. I am not that bored,” Luo Mingdao replied disdainfully while shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>While the disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were engaged in battle, cultivators from other sects and loose cultivators chose not to step forward. They simply stood and watched the battle from afar. They swore inwardly, hoping that more cultivators from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects would die off. It would be even better if this battle could lead to a war between the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The onlookers were quickly disappointed. Although the disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were attacking one another in a seemingly brutal fashion, the aftermath of their fight ended with not a single death. Rather, they weren’t even badly damaged from the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt amused and said scornfully, “I didn’t think that the disciples from every sect would hold back in the battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They aren’t fools. Killing can be done in secrecy, but not out in the open. The disciples fighting out there are all heir and elite disciples from the great sects. The deaths of one or two would shake the sect. When that happens, matters would escalate,” said Luo Mingdao with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Chen Feng recalled Ma Wu and Zhao Qiang. Those two heir disciples had died under his hands. Would the sect investigate the matter? Would they find out it was him?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>No matter what, though, the three young cultivators encircled by the cultivators there had no chance of escaping. Seeing the disciples from the great sects attacking each other furiously in order to obtain them, the three young cultivators instantly grew pale.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How long will they continue fighting? Do the immortal dao sects in our Northern Plains always resort to this method of resolving issues whenever something like this happens?” Chen Feng, who was still observing the chaos, could not stop the feelings of disbelief and scorn from rising.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How long they fight doesn’t matter. I will not be taking part in it no matter what happens.” Luo Mingdao shook his head helplessly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Someone else is joining the fight. I wonder which sect they are from?” Chen Feng narrowed his eyes as he noticed two purple-robed men leisurely flying towards the chaos from the sky above.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sudden appearance of the two purple-robed men was noticed by Luo Mingdao and he frowned in response. “Purple. Those two don’t look like members from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two purple-robed men were not simply wearing shining, purple-coloured clothes. Even their hair was purple in colour. Purple light could also be seen flashing out from the depths of their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. Something about those two isn’t right!” Luo Mingdao suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. I am incapable of determining their cultivation states. Could the two of them be Sky Human stage cultivators? They don’t look like it, though,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! Hurry, go!” After saying that, Luo Mingdao charged forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Luo Mingdao had only just made his move when the two purple-robed men increased their speed. Their bodies flashed forward and they appeared amidst the cultivators who were fighting one another. Next, their eyes unleashed waves of purple light, which enveloped the three panicking young cultivators. Three beams of light flashed as the three young cultivators disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened? Where are the three fellows?” shouted the cultivators from Sword Hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The two purple-robed men used an eye technique to take them away!” shouted the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you people? You dare offend our Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects? Are you tired of living?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack! Kill them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the countless cultivators attack them, the two purple-robed men sneered. Next, beam after beam of purple light shone from their bodies. The faint, mellow light spread out in every direction, giving off an illusionary spectacle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, everyone there soon found that the illusionary spectacle was actually a deathly sign from hell.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The purple-coloured beams of light were sharper than flying swords and faster than lightning. The beams criss-crossed through the area and the surrounding cultivators from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were pierced by them. Bloody holes appeared on their bodies and blood began flowing out from the holes. Their vitality began flowing away rapidly as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh, this is bad! Hurry up and back away!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One exchange had led to the deaths of several disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. Seeing that caused the other disciples to grow furious. They were used to being the arrogant ones. When had they ever faced such a loss? Driven by rage and impulse, all of them charged at the purple-robed men while unleashing their respective killer moves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t attack! Hurry up and back away!” shouted Luo Mingdao. He had yet to reach the scene. As he shouted, however, he sent out his flying shuttle. It transformed into a beam of light, which shot towards the two purple-robed men.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Many other cultivators who were within the crowd of onlookers joined forces with Luo Mingdao. Like Luo Mingdao, they were also from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects, but could not be bothered to join the fight earlier. Presently, however, seeing outsiders killing their fellow disciples, those cultivators could no longer stand idle. In an instant, tens of attacks launched using Prized artefacts charged towards the two purple-robed men.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The combined force of the many Prized artefacts was such that even a Sky Human stage expert would be hammered as a result. And yet, what they saw next left them astounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two purple-robed men did not panic. Instead, they once again released beam after beam of dazzling purple light. Under the effects of the strange purple light, the speed at which the tens of Prized artefacts were shooting towards them slowed down. By the time the purple light receded, the two purple-robed men had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Spatial power. Those two are Sky Human stage cultivators!” someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Which sect do the two purple-robed men belong to? They’ve killed so many disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects and provoked a huge problem.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Most likely, they are not from our Northern Plains. Maybe they are from the Central Plains.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry, inform our sect’s experts!” shouted the disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects even as they sent out their respective transmissions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Sky Human stage expert? Those two are clearly from the Purpleblood Clan.” A voice suddenly rang out within Chen Feng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower! Are you all right?” Chen Feng was pleasantly surprised to hear the voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nothing. The Devourer Beast is quite powerful. I am temporarily suppressing it. However, it will take some time to get the Demonic Heavengorging Art that it cultivates,” Tower slowly replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Chen Feng felt somewhat stunned. He had assumed that, by sucking the demon into the tower, Tower could toy with the demon. Unexpectedly, the demon was so powerful that Tower would be incapable of controlling the demon for so long.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right. What is that Purpleblood Clan you mentioned?” Chen Feng was suddenly reminded of the previous issue.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is but a Heaven-defying clan with special powers. Those two fellows are only at the Concealed stage, but were able to utilize eye techniques to break open space to leave this place,” Tower replied nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heaven-defying clan?” This was the first time Chen Feng had heard that term.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You will surely meet these clans in the future.” After saying that, Tower went silent again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Luo Mingdao’s face was very ugly to behold. No force had dared to provoke the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects within the Northern Plains. At that moment, however, someone had openly killed the disciples from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. Clearly, they did not view the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects as a threat. Their attacks just now had killed disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect as well. Moreover, those were mostly heir disciples. In fact, one of them happened to be an elite disciple. The sect itself would be thrown into an uproar this time around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Still, all the cultivators there believed that the two purple-robed men would be incapable of escaping. They had offended all the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. Even if they had come from the Central Plains, even if they possessed a powerful background, they would still be cut down without mercy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The members from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects of the Northern Plains stopped focusing their actions on the Driftcloud Immortal Mountain. Instead, they dispatched men to search for the two purple-robed men. Given the fact that the two purple-robed men had openly killed off so many of their disciples, the failure to drag out and kill the two purple-robed men would be a serious stain to their reputation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened here?” A middle-aged man swiftly descended from the sky. An overpowering atmosphere spread out, forcing all the cultivators there to back away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Sky Human stage cultivators from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects appeared.</span></p>
