 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crash! Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the lake continued to rock about turbulently, the chairs and various other items on the ship began falling into the lake. Some of the weaker cultivators also fell in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened? Did we encounter a water monster again?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Be on guard! Yao beasts are attacking!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What fell into the lake earlier?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng’s team had fallen too quickly, many cultivators did not notice them. However, some of the more powerful cultivators there had sharp eyes and were able to roughly notice them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The surface of the lake exploded in quick succession as Chen Feng’s team of three charged out from the lake. Their clothes and auras were all in a state of chaos.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How did we end up like this? How miserable!” Jian Xiaotian was completely drenched in water. His whole body was enveloped with primary energy and it did not take long for him to recover his normal state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is different compared to the teleportation using teleportation arrays. This teleportation process does not allow its users to utilize primary energy to protect themselves.” Chen Feng was also completely drenched in water.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, it is quite fast. I didn’t even have time to react before falling into the water,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who are you fellows? Why did you come here?” Three cultivators flew out from the big ship to hover before Chen Feng’s team of three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three of them stared intently at Chen Feng’s team of three, annoyed expressions etched on their faces. The three of them were the bodyguards serving on the big ship. Due to the earlier incident’s effect on the big ship, all the cultivators there were feeling displeased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the cultivators had come from various corners and were used to venturing into risky places. Every one of them was a refined character. Thus, none of them stepped forward to question Chen Feng’s team. Instead, they simply stood back to observe how the situation would develop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s soul power scanned about to quickly figure out what was happening on the ship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The strongest cultivator there only has 6 Lightning Tribulations under his belt. There are no experts here,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought. He simply did not view them as a threat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am asking you fellows a question here! Who are you fellows? Why did you fellows fall from the sky?” Getting no response from them, a look of anger flashed across the faces of the three cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team of three abruptly flashed forward to instantly appear on the deck of the ship. Seeing their sudden appearance, the cultivators on the deck reflexively backed away to create an open space where Chen Feng’s team of three could clearly be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing them suddenly disappear before their very eyes, the three guards were stunned. Next, they too, followed suit and reappeared on the deck.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just who are you fellows?” Two bodyguards with 3 Lightning Tribulations strode forward, each of them wielding a blade. Blade energy began surging out from each of them as they prepared to unleash a thunderous attack at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’re just passing by. What is this place?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Passers-by can fall from the sky? How wondrous!” one of the cultivators there – with a scar of his face – said with a sneer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng furrowed his brows. Next, he lifted one foot and gently stepped down with it. Immediately, the 100-zhang-long ship shook and the surrounding water surface instantly became turbulent. Waves rolled and pillars of water charged into the sky. Some water monsters were even quaked to death as a result and their corpses floated to the surface.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s move immediately stunned many of the cultivators on the ship. However, there were many cultivators on the ship. Naturally, some of the more powerful characters there did not view Chen Feng’s team of three as a threat. The two blade-wielding bodyguards were the first to make their move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two astral blades split the air as they slashed towards Chen Feng. However, Chen Feng simply stood there and did nothing. It was as though nothing was happening to him. However, Jian Xiaotian had already made his move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two simplistic sword beams flashed out and the two astral blades were broken apart. Next, the two bodyguards cried out wretchedly at the same time. They backed away, leaving a trail of blood behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Impressive! I didn’t even manage to see how he attacked. All I saw was a flash of sword light and the two guards were hit!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If anyone else tries anything, the consequences will be death,” Jian Xiaotian said, looking at the cultivators standing opposite him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Just a minor trick. All you did was defeat a level 3 Sky Human stage cultivator. I, Firecrow Daoist, will have you fellows witness my skills!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A ghastly-looking old man in black robes waved his hand and a fire dragon, ten plus metres long, appeared before pouncing at Jian Xiaotian. As Firecrow Daoist was making his move, several pillars of water spun forth from beneath the big ship to attack Chen Feng and Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Firecrow Daoist was openly attacking while another person was secretly attacking. They wanted to finish off Chen Feng’s team of three the instant they attacked. At the same time, several of the cultivators there were also secretly gathering their strength, ready to attack at any moment. At any rate, Chen Feng’s team of three appeared quite arrogant in their eyes. At the very least, all the cultivators on the big ship wanted to finish off these three outsiders.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’re courting death!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun made their move at the same time. One sword beam shot out to cut the fire dragon in half while Lin Shaokun ignored the incoming pillars of water. Instead, he stretched his hand out and dashed forward to grasp in the direction of a crowd of cultivators. One of them, a middle-aged cultivator, was caught.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The incoming pillars of water burst apart around Chen Feng’s team of three. A thick layer of primary energy shimmered in and out of view, blocking the attacks coming from all around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian’s figure disappeared. Next, a sword beam flashed across the big ship and Jian Xiaotian re-appeared on the same spot. As for Firecrow Daoist, he stared with widened eyes, a look of panic on his face as he fell down. There was a large hole on his chest and blood, mixed with flames, kept gushing out from the hole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Vaulting across the sky, Lin Shaokun then brought the middle-aged cultivator back. Chen Feng then unleashed a lightning-fast kick. The middle-aged cultivator did not even get the opportunity to scream before the kick sent him flying into the sky. His figure hurtled across a distance of several hundred zhang before smashing heavily into the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>That fellow’s dead.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Having witnessed the might of Chen Feng’s kick, the same thought appeared in the minds of all present.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who else wants to die?” Jian Xiaotian said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You three, don’t get too full of yourself! One at level 3 and one at level 2 of the Sky Human stage while another one hasn’t even reached the Sky Human stage. Now, abolish your cultivation bases and you can leave this place alive.” The level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator finally spoke up. When he spoke up, the big ship instantly gave a shudder. As for Chen Feng’s team of three, they felt as though a large hammer was smashing against their minds. It was so unbearable; they felt the urge to puke blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>A soul attack!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kill the three of them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Rip these three fellows to pieces! They are too arrogant!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I'll do it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, attack together!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator take action, everyone on the ship began clamouring.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Looks like there is no other choice but to put a show of force for them.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soul Subduing Mantra!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An invisible ripple swiftly radiated out from Chen Feng’s mind to instantly envelop all the cultivators on the ship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The several hundreds of cultivators on the big ship, the level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator included, fell into a dazed state. Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun swiftly attacked. The two of them kept darting about; thousands of sword beams and thousands of staff silhouettes flashed about and a series of thudding sounds could be heard. The cultivators on the ship were either beaten down or knocked into the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the sword beams and staff silhouettes had dissipated, only Chen Feng, Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun remained standing on the ship. Even the level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator had fallen to the floor, having received several blows from Lin Shaokun’s staff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What divine beings are they? How could they be so powerful?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators on the ship were shocked, thoroughly so. Every one of them stared at Chen Feng’s team of three with looks of dread.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kneel!” Jian Xiaotian shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Jian Xiaotian’s shout, the majority of the cultivators on the ship dreadfully fell to their knees. Naturally, there were still a good number amongst them who refused to yield.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am a member of Extreme Origin Sect! You three are courting death!” shouted a yellow-clad cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is our Water Surge Sect’s territory! You fellows must be tired of living!” Another cultivator shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two sword beams flashed by and the two cultivators were cleaved into two each.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, another group of cultivators bent their knees.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Great Sky Lightning Self-destruction!” The level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator was unwilling to yield. Surprisingly, he had decided to utilize a secret technique to blow himself up. His entire body began swelling up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and a ripple flowed out. Next, the cultivator was immediately pulled into the Longevity Tower, where he was refined into a Pure Essence Pill.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who else wants to blow themselves up?” Chen Feng asked coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Plop! Plop! Plop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, all the remaining cultivators chose to kneel. Some had even begun knocking their heads against the floor, begging for mercy. Even a level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator had been instantly dealt with, how much effort would it take him to deal with them? All the cultivators on the ship were inwardly praying that these killer gods would stop attacking them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All of you, get up. I just have some questions to ask you fellows,” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of the cultivators, clad in blue attire, emboldened himself and asked, “Seniors, what questions do you have?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where are we?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is Stormwave Lake,” the blue-clad cultivator immediately replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Stormwave Lake.” Chen Feng frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One of the ten largest lakes in the Northern Plains. We are in Star Assembly Sect’s territory,” Chen Feng said <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” The blue-clad cultivator nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are you fellows doing here?” Chen Feng asked again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is our Water Surge Sect’s ship. We came to this lake for some exploration and to hunt some water monsters and yao beasts.” Seeing no display of ill intentions from Chen Feng’s team of three, the blue-clad cultivator secretly released a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, that’s what’s going on.” Chen Feng’s team of three exchanged glances and they began discussing the matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I know this place. This place is not far from my master’s mountain residence. It is only 50,000 kilometres away from here. Looks like I will be able to see my master soon.” Lin Shaokun was somewhat excited.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, let’s just leave. There is no need to lower ourselves to fight them,” Jian Xiaotian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. However, we should first deal with the present issue.” After saying that, Chen Feng stamped his foot down heavily once again. This time, nothing happened to the ship. A potent force moved past the body of the ship down into the waters and a water monster that was about to attack the ship was ripped apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, three black silhouettes flashed by and three cultivators were snatched away. Screaming wretchedly was all they could do before disappearing into the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it a yao beast?” said Jian Xiaotian, who swiftly sent out two sword beams. Immediately, a thick tentacle was hacked down and it fell onto the deck.</span></p>
