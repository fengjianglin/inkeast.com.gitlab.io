 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Could it be something formed by a high-grade Immortal artefact?” asked a puzzled Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not necessarily. It could just be a small world,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s not talk about this. I want to ask you, when can you handle this meteorite? I cannot continue staying here. If the guys from Nine Firmaments Palace charge all the way here, I will be incapable of running away,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not at the moment. I do not have enough power. I do not have the confidence of forcibly taking it for fear of some unexpected variables. Even a few Sacred artefacts would cause my efforts to fail in the end,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine. If that is the case, we’ll wait for a little longer. If it comes down to it, I will just use the Longevity Tower to flee.” Chen Feng nodded helplessly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng continued to study the Great Longevity Palm. It was a secret technique with a minimum requirement of level 1 of the Sky Human stage. Successfully practicing this technique would allow the cultivator to unleash a great power. With a high enough cultivation level, the Great Longevity Palm condensed out with this technique could easily rip mountains and fill seas.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, it was not a smooth process for Chen Feng. Chen Feng had already understood the cultivation formula for the Great Longevity Palm. He had also clearly understood the primary energy circulation routes for the technique. Even so, he was simply incapable of condensing out the Great Longevity Palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had been failing for days. Every time, he would sense that he could pull it off. However, once he attempted to unleash the move, it would fail to take effect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Is this really due to my cultivation level?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Your cultivation level is a factor, but the biggest factors here are your aptitude and comprehension abilities. They are simply bad. I’ll say it again, your talent for cultivation is low!” Once again, Tower unleashed a critical hit at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng was already used to hearing those words. He then smiled and said, “If so, what about the others who practice this Great Longevity Palm? What is the lowest cultivation level at which they could succeed in unleashing this secret technique?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As far as I know, when it comes to the cultivation of the Great Longevity Palm, many talented cultivators could use it once they have condensed out their Soulflames. Of course, the cultivator with the lowest cultivation level ever to be able to use it was at level 1 of the Concealed stage,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are saying that there are people who can already use the Great Longevity Palm at level 1 of the Concealed stage?!” Chen Feng was shocked. He could not believe it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Naturally, I dare not compliment the resulting power of that Great Longevity Palm,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grew silent. He began pondering, was cultivation talent truly that important? However, his rate of cultivation was already very fast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, don’t worry! &nbsp;With me here, I guarantee that you will definitely become a super powerful expert.” Sensing Chen Feng’s crestfallen state, Tower quickly comforted him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! I don’t believe I cannot condense out the Great Longevity Palm!” Chen Feng refused to give up and he began cultivating again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Once again, Chen Feng raised his soul power. Immediately, he sensed a large palm silhouette the size of a small mountain charging towards him. The powerful atmosphere of oppression made it hard for him to even breathe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Great Longevity Palm!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shouted inwardly. Once again, Chen Feng failed and his figure was sent flying through a distance of over 100 zhang before falling down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had yet to even land on the ground when a rainbow streaked through the sky. Like a burning meteor, it shot towards Chen Feng, who was still in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>High-grade Prized artefact!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng instantly knew that the attacker was an expert. Moreover, he had no confidence in blocking the attack. Still, he did not feel too concerned as Lei Feng was already rushing over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Lei Feng practiced the Lightning Essence Art, his movement speed was very fast. In just the blink of an eye, he had arrived before Chen Feng. Reaching out with his hand, he performed a grasping motion. Shockingly, he had grabbed the rainbow.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A small, dainty, fiery-red flying sword thrashed about continuously within Lei Feng’s palm. However, it could not extricate itself from the crackling bolts of lightning on Lei Feng’s palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it’s a Flying Rainbow Sword.” Lei Feng smirked as he channelled his magic power into his palm. Lightning flashed out as he attempted to crush the small flying sword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Release the Flying Rainbow Sword!” A shout came from afar. Next, a fiery-red figure – resembling a flaming cloud – flew over. At the same time, several chilling motes of luminescence, radiating starlight, shot towards Lei Feng and Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Do you cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace only know how to use sneak attacks?” Lei Feng scoffed. A palm silhouette formed using the power of lightning suddenly charged out to knock the starlight motes away. However, a few of the starlight motes flew towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A flaming sword appeared in Chen Feng’s hand and a wave of sword light swept forward to knock all the starlight motes away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Like a slippery fish, the dainty, fiery-red flying sword swiftly jumped out from Lei Feng’s grasp, transforming into a beam of red light before flying into the hand of a female cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The female cultivator wore fiery-red robes. She possessed an attractive face and a beautiful appearance. However, the killing intent glinting within her eyes ruined all sense of her aesthetics.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is another fellow. Come out. There is no point in trying to hide from me.” Lei Feng flicked his finger to send out a sphere of lightning, which swirled towards a spot beside the red-clad female cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The space there trembled and a young and handsome-looking cultivator appeared beside the female cultivator. Surprisingly, this cultivator’s eyes were different from that of normal humans. His pupils were flashing with star light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Qian Hong and Liu Guang from Nine Firmaments Palace. What is this? You are utilizing sneak attacks against a normal disciple of our Extreme Celestial Sect? Are you not afraid of having your reputation fall to the gutter if word of this gets out?” Hua Zhuliu suddenly flew over, a derisive smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Looks like trouble has come.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng steadied himself. At the same time, he moved to position himself beside Lei Feng. Chen Feng could not tell if other cultivators would attack him or not.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We must take Chen Feng away. Lei Feng, I didn’t think that Extreme Celestial Sect would dispatch you for this disciple. Looks like your Extreme Celestial Sect wants to start a big war with our Nine Firmaments Palace,” the handsome male cultivator, Liu Guang, said icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Whether or not a war erupts is not up to you fellows. All I know is that Chen Feng is a core disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. No one is allowed to harm him, otherwise, do not blame me for not holding back,” Lei Feng said, killing intent pulsing out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lei Feng, it’s been a while. I wonder if your Lightning Essence Art has improved? I want to get some pointers from you!” Suddenly, a purple-coloured sword beam descended from the sky like a pillar of lightning to slash at Lei Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You guys, hurry up and back away!” Lei Feng’s face turned grim. A sword – flashing with lightning – appeared in his grasp. With a slash, the purple sword beam was instantly cleaved into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Riding a flying sword, a young cultivator with purple hair pierced through the sky as he flew forward. Everywhere he went, the clouds would be pushed aside like waves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s Zi Minglian from Purple Firmaments Palace. He has fought Brother Lei many times before in the past. He is also a level 9 Sky Human stage cultivator. Now that the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace and Purple Firmaments Palace have appeared, our situation is not looking good,” Hua Zhuliu quickly informed Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s face betrayed no emotions. However, he was thinking, <em>Nine Firmaments Palace alone possesses more power than Extreme Celestial Sect. With Nine Firmaments Palace, Purple Firmaments Palace and Transcendent Firmaments Palace joining hands, it would be possible for them to destroy Extreme Celestial Sect. Looks like I will need to hurry up and leave the Northern Plains!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heavenly Purple Thunder Astral Sword!” A thunderous, purple-coloured astral sword sliced through space as it bolted towards Lei Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lightning Tempest!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lei Feng dared not display weakness. The attack he unleashed was even more dazzling and powerful compared with the one used by his opponent. Soon, the two of them were engaged in a fight and it was hard to tell who had the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When the fight between the two of them began, Qian Hong and Liu Guang instantly charged towards Chen Feng. The Flying Rainbow Sword in Qian Hong’s hand transformed into a red-coloured cloud to attack Chen Feng while Liu Guang’s eyes fired out motes of starlight to stop Hua Zhuliu and Lei Batian, who had only just arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!” Chen Feng furiously hacked down with the flaming sword. However, the Flying Rainbow Sword rapidly dodged his move, drawing an arc in the sky before streaking towards Chen Feng’s face. It would appear that she wanted to kill him outright.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Flying Rainbow Sword was very powerful. Additionally, it was extremely fast. After a few clashes, Chen Feng ended up in a disadvantageous position. The sword even managed to leave several sword wounds on his shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This woman is a level 8 Sky Human stage cultivator while her flying sword is a grade 9 Prized artefact. I am hardly a match for her in this fight.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng understood his current situation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Chen, do not worry.” At that moment, the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect who were studying the meteorite were already rushing over. One of them, a cultivator named Luo Hui came to position himself before Chen Feng. With a palm strike, he smacked the Flying Rainbow Sword away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>These cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect were not some goody two-shoes. They don’t care about the identity of their opponents. Upon seeing a fight starting, they all swarmed forward, besieging Zi Minglian, Qian Hong and Liu Guang, unleashing a chaotic flurry of attacks against them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A slap sent Liu Guang flying and he furiously shouted, “Extreme Celestial Sect, have you guys gone crazy? Do you want to start a war with our Nine Firmaments Palace and Purple Firmaments Palace?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The hell do I care which sect are you from? You are not allowed to bully us!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right! So what if you are from Nine Firmaments Palace? Right now, we have the advantage in numbers. Of course, we can handle you fellows!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even as they were speaking, the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect continued to unleash more attacks at them. Both Qian Hong and Liu Guang were beaten and knocked around the instant the other cultivators joined the fight. As Qian Hong’s cultivation base was slightly weaker, her face turned pale. Finally, she could not endure anymore and she coughed out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows are going to die!” Seeing Qian Hong wounded, Liu Guang shouted furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect were besieging and unleashing a barrage of attacks upon the other party, three flying warships suddenly appeared from the distance, piercing through space as they flew over. The formidable and majestic atmosphere of oppression was seemingly desirous of choking everything within a large radius. The cultivators who were focused on studying the meteorite were all alarmed by the appearance of the three ships. Even Chen Feng’s eyelids were twitching.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Impressive. All three flying warships are Sacred artefacts! This is looking bad.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Each of the three Sacred-tier flying warships belonged to Nine Firmaments Palace, Purple Firmaments Palace and Transcendent Firmaments Palace respectively. The terrifyingly coercive atmosphere of majesty caused those who were fighting to stop. The cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect gathered together and Chen Feng saw that they all had grim expressions on their faces. However, none of them revealed looks of fear. Seeing that, Chen Feng could not stop himself from nodding. Still, he felt worried. The force that the other party was fielding this time around was too powerful. He feared that not even the Longevity Tower could handle it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When will our sect’s reinforcements arrive?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Even if our sect’s reinforcements arrive, they will probably be incapable of stopping the three sects!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect were not showing it, they were secretly communicating with one another.</span></p>
