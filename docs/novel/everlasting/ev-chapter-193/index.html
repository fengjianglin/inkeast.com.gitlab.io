 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was killing the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters, Pang Ban and his team of three had already captured more than 10 Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. Moreover, it appeared to be a casual feat for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Those three fellows are quite powerful. If they attack me, it will be hard for me to deal with them</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three Phantom Beasts suddenly emerged from hiding to simultaneously attack Pang Ban. Their level of intellect was incredibly high. Their move was aimed at finishing off one of the three elite disciples first.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The overpowering might behind their blows caused the rippling waves of fire and water behind Pang Ban to burst apart. As for Pang Ban, his figure shook and a trickle of blood flowed down from his mouth. Thankfully, Zhao Xiang and Liu Yu, who were beside him, quickly came to his aid. If it were not for them, the pressure he faced would have been even greater.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These Phantom Beasts are really hard to deal with. They only know how to launch sneak attacks. Additionally, their stealth abilities are extremely powerful. A pity that my Thousand Seeker Mirror’s grade is not high enough to accurately determine their location,” Pang Ban said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We cannot let them hold us down. Let’s kill our way out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three domains around them abruptly expanded. At the same time, one magic treasure after another swiftly flew out from their bodies. Instantly, they managed to kill off all of the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters and Phantom Beasts near them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Having successfully joined forces to gain the upper hand, the three elite disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect charged out, leaving Chen Feng inside the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters’ encirclement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those bastards. They left me here. However, they are not to be underestimated. Every one of them has a Prized artefact. Factoring in their personal strength, each of them is stronger than me.” Seeing them disappear from the place, Chen Feng reflexively swore.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The three of them actually ran away. It will be troublesome if they find the scene where I killed Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu. However, this is also a good opportunity.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng sneered. Under the orders of his divine sense, Purplebolt flew out from the Longevity Tower. After coming out, he immediately unleashed a tail whip to send the few surrounding Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are these things?” asked the puzzled Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm. He did not recognize the demonic creatures.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These are creatures from the Demon Plane. They are not from our Eternal World,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A purple-coloured lightning bolt shot out from Purplebolt’s horn to pierce through several of the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hmm? There is something hiding here.” After saying that, Purplebolt sent a dragon talon silhouette out. Immediately, a Phantom Beast that was hiding itself nearby was killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Purplebolt, I don’t need your help here. You go chase after the three fellows that are running away. All three of them have Prized artefacts, so you have to be careful. Do not kill them. You just need to snatch away the mirror that one of them possesses for me,” Chen Feng quickly instructed him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A little difficult.” Having said that, Purplebolt flew forward and all the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters in its path were sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not use the opportunity to break through their encirclement. Instead, he brandished Bloody Soul and kept fighting. The will to fight radiating from him gradually rose, growing stronger and stronger. Bloody Soul’s power too, kept rising and it emitted an even stronger aura of bloodthirst.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For Chen Feng, this was a good opportunity to engage in battle. Although there were who knows how many demonic beasts around him, Chen Feng did not believe that they could threaten him. Additionally, Chen Feng could sense something else. The more blood Bloody Soul absorbed, the more power it was displaying. It was also becoming more responsive to his commands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knew this was a good opportunity to train himself. Moreover, fighting these ferociously savage demonic beasts could stimulate his potential.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He planned on assailing level 3 of the Concealed stage while in combat. After successfully doing so, he could take the promotion assessment for inner discipleship after returning to the sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt a lack of drive as an outer disciple. There was no competition there at all. For Chen Feng, such a situation would only gradually weaken his desire for progress.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng abruptly twisted to send a heavy palm strike at a cloaked Phantom Beast that was staying in the sky. A powerful force sent him backwards. However, Chen Feng smiled. Thanks to the earlier attack, his divine sense had caught the whereabouts of the Phantom Beast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, do Phantom Beasts only know how to attack from behind? If that is the case, there is nothing to fear from them,” Chen Feng said with a smile. The primary energy inside his body swiftly circulated and his numb arm quickly recovered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng jabbed back and forth using Bloody Soul, stabbing out in every direction. Despite having fallen into their encirclement, Chen Feng felt a great sense of joy. A sense of excitement born of battle kept growing within him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you think that outer disciple will die to those demonic beasts?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Pang Ban’s team had successfully shaken off the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters chasing after them. They were in the process of moving towards the spot where Chen Feng had killed both Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Probably not. He is keeping his true strength deeply hidden. Additionally, he also possesses Prized artefacts. He will likely possess other tricks up his sleeves. I think he should be able to break out as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What should we do, then? Are we to just let him go? Do not forget, that kid has two Prized artefacts. That demonic artefact in particular exudes an aura that terrifies even me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. The kid cannot escape. I have already placed Soultrace Scent on him. No matter where he runs off to, I will be able to find him. Besides, he is a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. With our strength and identity, it will be easy to deal with him. For now, let’s investigate Zhao Qiang and Ma Wu’s disappearance first. I have this feeling that it is related to that Chen Feng.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the three of them were hammering the details of their plan, Purplebolt caught up to them. The Great Yao was in fact, feeling vexed. Although he had yet to formally overcome Lightning Tribulation, he already possessed the power of a Great Yao. He should have been an existence that could trample about wantonly, collecting some yao beasts as his subordinates while living the high life. Unexpectedly, he ended up getting suppressed by a human and had a soul imprint placed inside his soul, thereby becoming a helper with no freedom of his own.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every time he recalled that fact, Purplebolt’s entire body would shudder in rage. And yet, there was nothing he could do about it. As his soul was under Chen Feng’s control, not even overcoming Lightning Tribulation was enough for him to rid himself of Chen Feng’s control.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After getting to move around, Purplebolt forgot all about Chen Feng’s instructions. The resentment that was building up within him turned into murderous attacks aimed at Pang Ban’s team of three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is a Great Yao!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time Pang Ban and the others noticed, the attack that Purplebolt unleashed had descended upon them. Berserk purple-coloured lightning serpents opened their jaws widely to aggressively rip them into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the elite disciples of Extreme Celestial Sect, the three of them only panicked slightly in the face of the attack. Immediately, they unleashed their strongest attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yaksha of Water and Fire!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thousand Layer Astral Stone!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Great Sun Cycle!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A large yaksha formed from both fire and water appeared. Wielding a fork in its hand, it stabbed at the lightning serpents falling down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Layer after layer of rocks – each as hard as shields – kept forming atop their heads, becoming like a mountain that had overcome 10,000 years of wind and rain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A circular sun, shining with dazzling rays of light appeared. It then shot straight towards the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They had combined the might of their lifebound magic treasures and their domain powers to unleash those attacks. Under normal circumstances, this attack could even let them confront a Sky Human stage cultivator for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Calamitous explosions erupted one after another and the few small mountains around them were flattened as a result as rivers were cut and forests were destroyed. It was as though a hundred hurricanes had struck the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt’s long body kept swirling in the sky. Its large eyes stared down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three booming sounds rang out as Pang Ban, Liu Yu and Zhao Xiang charged out from within a mountain of rocks in quick succession. Although they were all covered in dust, appearing most wretched, the auras they exuded had not weakened in the slightest. Moreover, they were not too badly hurt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt, having expected this situation, opened his jaws and released a thunderous roar, sending soundwaves high into the firmament. The soundwaves also exerted a formidable atmosphere of suppression upon the three of them. The ground beneath them, ranging over 100 zhang in radius, exploded upwards before transforming into nothingness (1 zhang = 3.333 m).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, join forces to kill this Great Yao!” Pang Ban shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right! I just happen to require the blood of a Great Yao to concoct medicinal pills,” Liu Yu shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt clashed against the three elite disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect in a fiery confrontation. As for Chen Feng, he was still under siege.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng brandished Bloody Soul, which transformed into red lines in the air, killing three Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters in quick succession. However, one of the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters managed to close in on him and leave a deep wound on his body. A vast amount of demonic energy surged into Chen Feng’s body, intent on destroying Chen Feng’s vitality.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not bother dealing with the wound. Instead, his figure slid 10 zhang forward. Suddenly, a burst of energy erupted at the very spot that he was standing upon earlier. It was the sneak attack of another invisible Phantom Beast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These Phantom Beasts are really hard to deal with,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By now, Chen Feng had killed close to 20 Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. Bloody Soul, having absorbed a high amount of blood, kept thrumming while radiating a massive power. It seemed as though it was trying to escape Chen Feng’s grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng gripped Bloody Soul tightly, not letting it go as every attack he unleashed with it grew increasingly violent and ferocious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was concentrating on killing and fighting the demonic beasts around him, the Soulflame in his sea of wisdom had condensed itself into a clump of flames to ceaselessly assail the barrier for his 3<sup>rd</sup> sea of wisdom layer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With every attack, a crack would appear on his 3<sup>rd</sup> sea of wisdom barrier. By then, there were already tens of cracks upon the barrier. However, no energy was able to escape still. Chen Feng knew that this barrier was tens of times more resilient compared to the 2<sup>nd</sup> barrier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Gagagagagaga!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the group of Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters surrounding Chen Feng released a series of peculiar crying sounds. Then, they stopped attacking Chen Feng and rapidly gathered together.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was watching them with puzzled eyes, the demonic energy around the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters left them to reveal their dark and tough bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are they doing?” Chen Feng was baffled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, it’s nothing. It is just a minor trick. You will know soon enough,” Tower replied with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The demonic energy hovering around the bodies of at least 100 Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters flew up to converge in the sky. After merging together, it then took the form of a huge demonic face. Although it appeared somewhat vague, the fangs on the face, gleaming with black lustre, gave Chen Feng a sense of foreboding.</span></p>
