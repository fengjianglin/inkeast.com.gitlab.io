 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Again, Chen Feng could only leave bursts of sparks upon the surface of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body, further enraging the Great Yao. A stream of flames shot out from its body and enveloped Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The surrounding space suddenly fluctuated slightly and the flames wrapping Chen Feng were sucked into the Longevity Tower before they could impose their might upon Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! Try this.” Suddenly, a drop of black-coloured water appeared before Chen Feng. The water droplet fluttered through the air and gently struck the surface of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, the scale that had remained undamaged in the face of a Prized artefact’s attack was corroded, and a small hole appeared. Furthermore, the corrosion was still spreading.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh! What is this thing?” The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm immediately cried out in dread. It was as though it had witnessed a most unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black water droplet was none other than Vile Fountain Water. When Tower sent the water droplet out earlier, Chen Feng had not expected something like this to happen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave of his hand, tens of Vile Fountain Water droplets scattered around, striking the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body. Streams of vile energy spread out and even the flames on the surface of the Great Yao’s body began fluctuating. It was as though they would be extinguished at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Great Yao had originally possessed both the attributes of ice and fire. However, its ice-attribute head had been cut off and its essence power was damaged, leaving only its fire-attribute power. Coincidentally, the Vile Fountain Water was a counter to its fire attribute.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the current situation was only possible due to the severe injuries on the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm. If it were not for that, the Vile Fountain Water would not have been very effective.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, the flames covering the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body were completely extinguished, revealing a body filled with corroded holes. Chen Feng seized the opportunity and sent a stab forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm howled loudly and it quickly knocked Purplebolt far away. Next, its massive body rapidly shrunk, transforming into a muscular, middle-aged man in fiery-red leather attire. His body brimmed with the power of fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Streams of thunderbolts shot out from the single horn on Purplebolt’s head. After having put away the fires, Purplebolt ceaselessly unleashed his strongest attacks towards the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was only taken back for a moment before quickly recollecting himself. Brandishing his bloody lance, he charged forward again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave of his hand, the middle-aged man sent a blade – made of raging fires – at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they clashed, Chen Feng felt something amiss. After assuming human form, the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s aura had clearly grown weaker. However, his aura also grew more solid. More importantly, the speed at which he was attacking had increased.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a brief clash, a flaming blade sent Chen Feng flying. Although the Longevity Tower had absorbed away the flames from the attack, it failed to absorb the momentum behind the attack. During the collision, Chen Feng could hear his bones fracturing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Something more shocking happened after that. After spending some time attacking furiously, Purplebolt’s massive body also quickly shrank as he assumed human form as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A handsome youngster in fully white attire appeared before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purple-coloured hair, white-coloured clothes and eyes containing moving white light. That was the appearance Purplebolt took after assuming human form.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You, Purplebolt?” Chen Feng was actually surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since I have overcome 1 Lightning Tribulation, I can assume human form,” said Purplebolt coolly. Next, he waved his hand and a sword formed using lightning bolts appeared in his hand. After that, he charged forward to battle the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The battle lasted for one joss stick’s worth of time. After that, the bodies of all three became filled with wounds. The wounds on Chen Feng and Purplebolt’s bodies were all from flaming blades while the wounds on the middle-aged man’s body was more unique. There were bloody holes all over his body. Those were all due to the Vile Fountain Water and the bloody lance in Chen Feng’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the battle dragged on, the middle-aged man grew increasingly vexed. No matter what, he was a Great Yao with 8 Lightning Tribulations under his belt. Today, two ants had actually forced him into such a predicament. Not to mention, if they were to continue fighting, there was no telling if he could even escape with his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave of his hand, Chen Feng sent a Longevity Furnace down from the sky to directly imprison the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Throughout their fight, Chen Feng had used up all possible attacks. At that very moment, Chen Feng himself did not know why he used this technique. However, it was fairly useful. At the very least, it managed to entrap the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The gradual process of cracking did not even occur. The Longevity Furnace instantly exploded into fragments, scattering into the sky. The fragments swiftly transformed into strands of spiritual energy and disappeared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you think you can trap me with this level of trickery? You are simply dreaming!” The middle-aged man laughed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another Longevity Furnace descended, covering the middle-aged man completely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Once again, the Longevity Furnace was casually shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Kid, what other abilities do you have? Bring it all out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, it was not the Longevity Furnace anymore. Instead, it was a nine-level tower. It was none other than the Longevity Tower. It descended from the sky to imprison the middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why did you change to using a tower? Are you not going to use your crappy furnace anymore?” The middle-aged man sneered, allowing the Longevity Tower to encase him so that he can shatter it apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Purplebolt saw the Longevity Tower appear, he stopped attacking. Instead, he casted an ‘I am looking at a fool’ expression at the human form of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm. In the end, only the nine-level pagoda tower remained on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>While others might not be in the know, Purplebolt knew all too well just how powerful that tower was. In the past, he had been sucked in just like that. Not to mention, he had spent quite some time staying inside the Longevity Tower. From what Purplebolt could gather, after entering the Longevity Tower, one can forget about breaking out. Even if the Great Yao had fully recovered, it would be useless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng beckoned and the Longevity Tower slowly shrank and flew into his palm. Looking at the ancient and damaged Longevity Tower, Chen Feng revealed a smile. With a swing of his palm, the Longevity Tower transformed into a stream of light and flowed into his glabella.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, I will leave the rest to you,” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No problems. I have recovered a bit recently. It will be a stain on my reputation if I cannot even restrain this wounded little snake. Right, I will now transfer the formula for the Demonic Heavengorging Art to you.” After Tower was done speaking, Chen Feng felt a formula appear within his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You finally got it?” Chen Feng felt somewhat excited. A technique that Tower would acknowledge was certainly not an ordinary one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I extracted this from the Devourer Beast’s mind. However, it is only the beginner version of the Demonic Heavengorging Art. Additionally, it is just a formula fragment. Still, you are practicing the Longevity Scripture’s Heavengulping Absorption Technique. It has some similarities with this demonic technique. You figure it out yourself. I will now focus on dealing with this little snake,” Tower said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What about the Devourer Beast?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is still on the second level. However, there is only a corpse left now.” After saying that, Tower went silent. Chen Feng tried sensing about and heard an enraged roar coming from the second floor of the Longevity Tower. It was none other than the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, Chen Feng felt fortunate. If the Great Yao hadn’t suddenly assumed its human form, it would have been hard to trap it inside the tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>No matter what, he had gained a lot this time around. The value of a Great Yao that had overcome 8 Lightning Tribulations was hard to estimate. However, there was one thing that Chen Feng was certain of. Even if there were ten times more Magic crystals on him, he would be incapable of buying up a Great Yao such as this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you plan on doing now? Will you return to the tower to recover or stay outside?” Chen Feng asked, looking at Purplebolt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The spiritual energy here is good. I will stay outside.” Purplebolt’s human form, the youngster, revealed a somewhat haughty face. He sat down and began absorbing the surrounding worldly spiritual energy to heal up his wounds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng smiled and said nothing. Purplebolt was a Great Yao, after all. It was only natural for him to possess a certain amount of arrogance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had not only succeeded in capturing a Great Yao in the battle. He had also improved his combat moves by a notch. As his cultivation base grew more profound, Chen Feng gradually realized his own shortcomings. These shortcomings could only reveal itself as time passed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not consider it as a bad thing. Rather, he felt it was a good thing. By having the ability to clearly recognize his own shortcomings, he would be able to figure ways to make up for them in the future. That way, he would be able to continue improving and grow ever stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After quickly browsing through the Demonic Heavengorging Art’s formula, Chen Feng realized that it was not something that he could successfully practice in a short period of time. Additionally, he was presently not in a suitable situation for cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Purplebolt focusing on his own cultivation, Chen Feng hurriedly set up a few restrictive magic arrays. After that, he entered the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s lair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Since this is the lair of a Great Yao, it must hold some good items, right?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought as he excitedly entered the hole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had only just entered the hole when heat waves rushed towards him, causing the recently healed up wounds on his body to tear open again. Feeling helpless, Chen Feng had to turn back. He then spent half a day’s time to recover. After adjusting his state, he ventured into the hole once again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Hopefully I can find some good items. That way, the earlier fight to the death would not have been for nothing,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng grew disappointed. It was a very normal underground cavern. It was so ordinary it appeared as though it had formed naturally.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Nothing at all but a climbing temperature. After venturing even deeper, Chen Feng heard the burning sound of flowing magma and raging earthen fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This fellow is just a poor man. It doesn’t have even a piece of spirit stone. What a serious loss on my part! All those materials I used have gone to waste!” Chen Feng could not stop himself from shouting out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After searching through the place and sensing the high temperature there, Chen Feng finally concluded that the place was merely a special cultivation spot for the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm. Unlike what he had originally imagined, the place was not its lair.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Still, the fire here is very strong. I can cultivate here for a moment.” After saying that, Chen Feng found a suitable spot and began cultivating himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the very least, it could provide Chen Feng with a small comfort.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng channelled his cultivation technique, strands of fire essence began converging towards Chen Feng’s body. Finally, they became like water flowing into yellow sands, seeping into Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Of the Five Elemental acupoints, Chen Feng had opened up the Wood acupoint. Thus, the fire essence entering his body immediately ignited his Wood acupoint, causing the primary energy within his body to enter a state of chaos.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Woah! I forgot about the relationship between the five elements! It seems the next stage of cultivation will be quite difficult. I will need to figure a way to refine some more magic treasures. By utilizing magic treasures to safeguard the acupoints, I can avoid having my body fall into a state of chaos</span></em><span>. Chen Feng considered.</span></p>
