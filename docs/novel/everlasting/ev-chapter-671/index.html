 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seemingly provoked by the Heavenly might, the broken sword released a rumbling sound. Next, an even stronger sword intent soared up into the sky to tear space apart. The incomparably domineering sword intent swept through the surroundings of the broken sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, the tempest of sword beams became even more intense, like a tsunami bombarding the shores. Everywhere they went, the hard ground would be eroded into powdery bits.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad, retreat!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The expressions on Wen Shaoxiu and the others sank sharply and they ran as fast as they could to distance themselves from the broken sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the tempest of sword beams was even faster and it quickly enveloped them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The Lightning Tribulation ended up triggering the Immortal artefact! I wonder what will happen as a result?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Sensing the overwhelming waves of sword intent, Chen Feng’s face sank as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The power of the broken sword was simply too formidable. In fact, Chen Feng wondered if it could destroy a minor pocket dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Strange, the Lightning Tribulation has stopped. Was it affected by the broken sword?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Chen Feng was considering that, the broken sword thrummed once again and a thick, blood-coloured sword beam slashed at the tribulation clouds hovering above Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That one attack blasted out a colossal hole through the thick tribulation clouds. Next, the tribulation clouds swiftly dispersed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for all the tribulation clouds to be ripped apart, scattering away before utterly disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Seriously? The tribulation clouds disappeared just like that? But my Lightning Tribulation has yet to end? What is this supposed to be?” Chen Feng mumbled, feeling somewhat depressed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the tribulation clouds gone, there was no way any more lightning attacks would descend upon him. Looking at the current situation, it would appear that there was a need for him to go farther to undergo his tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was feeling depressed about it, a stream of the will of the world descended to pour into him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The will of the world?! I have already overcome my Lightning Tribulation?!” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By sensing it for a moment, Chen Feng was able to determine that he had indeed successfully overcome his Lightning Tribulation. Although this will of the world was somewhat different from the previous ones, he was certain that he was not mistaken. Additionally, this will of the world also contained some other wills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>A different understanding of the world and also the will of chaos. Although these powers are still not comparable to that of a Human Immortal’s Heavenly Tribulation, they are already very close. However, the Lightning Tribulation was dispersed by this broken sword. In other words, I am able to acquire the benefits without going through the necessary procedure.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The will of the world is fair. Since I am able to so easily overcome this tribulation, my next tribulation will likely become incredibly hard, unless I cultivate the Heavenstealing Technique. Even so, not going through the tempering from the lightning attacks means that my fleshly body is not improved. Not to mention, losing all that lightning powers is also unfortunate.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Still, I am now a level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator. Not to mention, I can feel it. The power I have accumulated is still very strong. Once I am done comprehending the will of the world, I can undergo another Lightning Tribulation!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As he studied the will of the world, Chen Feng slowly flew away, his body enveloped by sword light. The tempest of sword beams, on the other hand, was growing even stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In just one breath’s worth of time, he had covered a distance of several hundred li. Then, he landed on the ground, where he closed his eyes for his cultivation process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What, the Lightning Tribulation has disappeared? The guy actually succeeded in overcoming his Lightning Tribulation! What is this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This kid is truly lucky. To think that he could succeed in such a manner.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s all because of the broken sword. The Lightning Tribulation triggered the might of the broken sword. That is an Immortal artefact, after all. It can easily break apart the tribulation clouds. However, despite its interference, the will of the world had still descended.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! It doesn’t look like good luck to me. Rather, it’s bad luck. Right now, the kid is in the midst of comprehending the will of the world while the others from Heavenly Sword Faction are stuck inside the tempest of sword beams. This is a good opportunity for us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right! Attack! Some of us will head over to kill off the kid while the rest go handle Wen Shaoxiu’s group.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After coming to a decision, they quickly took action. Three cultivators who had gone invisible to linger around Chen Feng earlier attacked to kill Chen Feng while the others rushed towards the tempest of sword beams.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, undergoing tribulation here? You are courting death! Don’t blame us for this, just die!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shadowless Killersword!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three cultivators attacked Chen Feng simultaneously. Formidable energy streams condensed and sword light charged forward uncontested to arrive before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, on the other hand, did not move. His eyes remained closed as he focused wholeheartedly on cultivating himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Success!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng not make a move at all, the three cultivators felt delighted. Excited, they channelled even more power into their moves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, a massive, pitch-black python appeared, coiling around Chen Feng as it exuded a formidable atmosphere of power. It was so powerful that even the surrounding space ended up shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The massive python was 100 zhang long and its whole body was black. Streams of demonic energy swirled around its body and the dense, black-coloured scales on its body shone with a peculiar lustre. Its pair of dark-red eyes were capable of entrancing others and a hard spike grew from its forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was none other than the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss from the Demon Subduing Mountain, a high-level Demon King. It was an existence strong enough to kill off a high-level Human Immortal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Normally, Chen Feng would have chosen to personally take action, killing those cultivators off with his own hands. However, he was presently in the midst of comprehending the will of the world and worldly laws. If he were to allow himself to be interrupted, it would affect his cultivation process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Chen Feng had released one of the Demon Kings. Revealing one of his trump cards like this was not something Chen Feng would usually do. However, he was left with no other options. If it came down to it, he would simply have to silence them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A high-level Demon King. Forget these half-step Human Immortals, even genuine Human Immortals would die in the face of this Demon King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this? Oh, shit! It’s a demonic beast, a very powerful demonic beast!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How did a demonic beast appear here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This guy was the one who released it! Run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three cultivators discarded all thoughts about attacking. Turning around, they attempted to flee. The aura emanating out from the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss was simply too powerful. The cultivators could not find it in them to even think about fighting back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, they were quickly horrified to find that they could no longer move. It was as though they had fallen into a quagmire and a suffocating feeling assailed their minds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Dread instantly emerged and the three cultivators, despite their desire to beg for mercy, found that they were incapable of even opening their mouths, let alone crush their Teleportation Talismans.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I don’t want to die! I don’t wanna die here!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I have been hailed as a genius since young! Cultivating up to this level hasn’t been easy and I am already on the verge of breaking through to the Human Immortal stage! How can I just die here!!!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It’s over! It’s totally over. I’m totally screwed now.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The thoughts flashed across their minds, but the thoughts were incapable of helping them in any shape or form.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Netherpython of the Nine Abyss did not display any violent moves. Instead, it simply turned its gaze towards the three cultivators. Its dark-red eyes flashed and the three cultivators instantly erupted into a mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss opened its mouth and inhaled gently. The mist of blood transformed into a red thread, which entered its mouth. It left not a single drop behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Demonic beast! A high-level demonic beast!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The commotion on Chen Feng’s side instantly alerted the other cultivators. When they saw the massive demonic beast coiling up into the sky, their jaws dropped. Every one of them felt their hairs standing on end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>A pity. The three fellows are half-step Human Immortals, after all. Their blood essence could be used to concoct out a few Blood Pills, but this fellow devoured them all</span></em><span>. Chen Feng diverted a portion of his attention to check what was happening.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Netherpython, continue attacking, but leave their corpses behind,” Chen Feng ordered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Netherpython of the Nine Abyss said nothing. The spike on its head immediately fired out several formidable beams of energy. Like compressed sword beams, they shot forward, piercing through space at a speed beyond the human eye. Only those cultivators with a strong enough soul power would be able to sense them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every one of the beams killed a cultivator. No matter how fast the cultivators ran, no matter how powerful the body armour they wore were, in the face of this near-invisible attack, bloody holes appeared on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Additionally, the energy beams also contained powerful demonic energy. In just a flash, the beams had destroyed the vital forces within the cultivators’ bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators besieging Wen Shaoxiu and the others were thus all killed. Then, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss turned its gaze towards the other cultivators who were hundreds of li away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not matter how far away they were. The Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ attacks were capable of ignoring distance to easily kill off their targets.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Some of them quickly ran in fear. However, not even that could save them from getting killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, one of them crushed his Teleportation Talisman. A spatial passageway appeared to send the cultivator out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As swift as the wind, an energy beam flashed forward to pierce the spatial passageway and kill the cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One Teleportation Talisman after another was crushed as the cultivators chose to escape back to the outside world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even though there was a distance of several hundred li between them, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss was still capable of easily killing them off. Thus, the cultivators felt dread going all the way to the depths of their hearts. When they saw the cultivators die despite having crushed their Teleportation Talismans, a feeling of hopelessness enveloped them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two more cultivators were killed as they were in the process of getting teleported out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A playful but savage look flashed across the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ eyes. Having to submit to a minor cultivator like Chen Feng had left it feeling very dissatisfied. Thus, it decided to vent the dissatisfaction within its heart by butchering the cultivators there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss, killing off the cultivators was easier than killing a fly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As nearly all the cultivators within a radius of several hundred li from Chen Feng were about to be killed off, the broken sword suddenly fired out a thin, blood-coloured sword light. The sword light rapidly swept outwards, slicing about as it did and even space was sliced in its wake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sword light was aimed at the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bring it! Demonic Flamesurge of the Nine Abyss!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the attack, streams of demonic energy surged across the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ body to quickly converge upon its spike, where they compressed to become a black-coloured ball of radiant demonic flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The radiant ball of flames shot out swiftly, at least three times faster compared to the energy beams from earlier. Ribbon-like ripples, black in colour, spread out across space and the radiant ball of flames smashed against the blood-coloured sword light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The blood-coloured sword light cleaved the black-coloured, radiant ball of flames before continuing forward to assail the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A sense of crisis descended upon the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss. By avoiding the attack, Chen Feng would end up getting hit. Thus, it twisted its body and its tail swiped forward to take on the blood-coloured sword light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A thunderclap-like sound reverberated out as the tail swipe shattered the blood-coloured sword light. However, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss grunted as its massive body was sent flying, tumbling as it did before smashing heavily against the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To Chen Feng’s surprise, a crack had appeared upon the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ tail. Tens of scales had been broken from that and blood trickled down from the wound.</span></p>
