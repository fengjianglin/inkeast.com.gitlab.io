 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the smile on Zhao Quan’s face, the smile on Luo Mingdao’s face disappeared instead and an icy aura emanated out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scram! Right now! If Zhao Hai wants this mountain, let him come in person. Who do you think you are?” Luo Mingdao said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The smile on Zhao Quan’s face disappeared, replaced by a reddened face. However, he dared not act up. This was an elite disciple, two ranks above his current rank of inner disciple. And yet, Zhao Quan was used to being the overbearing one. A suffocating sensation festered within his heart, making him extremely uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Gritting his teeth, Zhao Quan said, “Senior Brother Luo, you should know that I am a member of the Zhao Family.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Members of the Zhao Family are also members of Extreme Celestial Sect.” After saying that, Luo Mingdao finally took action. Luo Mingdao gently waved his hand and Zhao Quan felt an energy stream locking down upon him. Next, a brutish force slapped him in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The slap sent Zhao Quan spinning a few times. When he finally got back up, a bright-red palm print could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!” Zhao Quan spat out a few teeth from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a little lesson for you. A minor inner disciple dares to challenge the authority of an elite disciple? Even if I abolish your cultivation base, no one would say anything,” Luo Mingdao said with an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well. We’ll leave.” Zhao Quan gritted his teeth. Waving his hand, he led his subordinates away. However, before leaving, he turned around and sent a vicious stare at both Chen Feng and Lu Ta.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems that fellow has a grudge against you two?” said Luo Mingdao as he looked at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A minor conflict. However, I ended up causing Senior Brother Luo some troubles,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“By himself, he is nothing to fear. However, he is a member of the Zhao Family. That family has experts in them. You will have to be careful. If anything happens, go find Sage Moonbow,” Luo Mingdao kindly advised Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is the Zhao Family very strong?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Zhao Family have a few sages. Rumour has it, they also have an old fogey who has spent many years in cultivation retreat, comprehending the Human Immortal dao,” Luo Mingdao said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Comprehending the Human Immortal dao.” Chen Feng furrowed his brows. Should such a character take action, he was assuredly a goner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Why would such a character attack juniors like us? However, you must still practice caution. At any rate, the Zhao Family holds a considerable amount of power within our sect,” Luo Mingdao said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Luo Mingdao’s departure, Chen Feng and Lu Ta began looking around their residence. They circled the whole place once before landing at the top of the mountain. Observing the drifting clumps of clouds, Chen Feng felt his heart throbbing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lu Ta checked their surroundings and said, “This place is much, much better compared to our previous residence. However, the herbs here seem lacking in number. Moreover, they are also not old enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is only natural. The previous owner must have collected those that are old enough. However, there is no need for us to worry about that. It will not take long for us to move again,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean, heir disciple?” Lu Ta was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Correct. Although this place is much, much better compared to that of outer disciples, it is no match for those of heir disciples. We can forget about matching it against those of elite disciples. I have already condensed out my Soulflame. What I lack now is the accumulation of comprehension, cultivation and primary energy. However, all those can be accumulated through time. I believe it wouldn’t take long for me to reach the necessary level. Then, I can be promoted to heir disciple,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Now, it’s time for us to check our harvest from the trip,” Chen Feng continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Previously, they had gone to exterminate the Bloody Whirlwind bandits and looted the bandits’ treasure trove. They acquired a high number of Magic crystals and some other cultivation materials. They had also seized some spatial pouches there, but had yet to check its contents. Chen Feng had this faint feeling that the spatial pouches must contain the good stuff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Even if we are to ignore these spatial pouches, the tens of millions of Magic crystals are enough for us to break through several levels.” Chen Feng laughed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Still, I really want to see what kind of good items are inside,” said Lu Ta, who brought out a very fine-looking spatial pouch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After sending his divine sense into the spatial pouch, Lu Ta revealed a look of shock. Then, it turned into one of wild joy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What kind of good stuff are in there? You look so happy,” Chen Feng could not stop himself from asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lu Ta waved his hand and tens of flying swords swooshed out like streams of light. Each of them was one-chi-long. The light coursing across its surface gave off a haughty atmosphere. Clearly, they were all high-grade magic swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mm, these are grade 5 Magic artefacts, these are grade 6 Magic artefacts. There is even a grade 7 Magic artefact. Not bad, we’ll be able to sell them for a good price,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sell them?” Lu Ta was shocked. He felt his heart aching as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, I won’t be using these. Should I leave them around as decoration? Or do you want to refine all of them?” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is true. I forgot that you already have Prized artefacts. However, I prefer using my Endless Sky of Turbidity staff. It seems we’ll have to sell these swords.” Lu Ta was beset by a feeling of lament.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lu Ta continued pulling out items from the spatial pouches. Other than the flying swords, there were also some other magic treasures. Magic seals, magic robes, dragon-binding ropes, all-sealing nets, eight trigrams mirrors, seven killing blades and various other assortment of weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All those weapons were high-grade weapons. However, not one of them caught Chen Feng’s attention. The reason was simple. All of them were Magic artefacts. Not a single one of them was a Prized artefact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Other than magic treasures, there are also some ores and metals. It looks quite good. I don’t even recognize some of them,” Lu Ta said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll take all the ores and metals,” Chen Feng said bluntly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the reason Chen Feng wanted all the ores and metals was for the Longevity Tower. Although Chen Feng knew that finding those divine-tier metals and ores required was incredibly difficult, he would not give up on even the slightest possibility of finding them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Other than that, there are also some medicinal herbs. Tsk, tsk. These are good items. To think that they even have some seeds for medicinal herbs. We can plant these in the valley.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Additionally, Lu Ta also found some other miscellaneous items. Amongst them were those they recognized and those they do not. To Chen Feng’s disappointment, there were no Prized artefacts or high-grade medicinal pills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, there could be some good items on my side.” Chen Feng waved his hand and a pile of spatial pouches appeared on the ground. Those were obtained by killing the bandits fleeing from the treasure trove. Some were obtained by killing those he encountered on the way to the treasure trove.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng opened the spatial pouches one by one. As expected, there was quite a number of items inside. Additionally, they were all of varying grades. Crystals, metals, medicinal herbs, magic treasures and some medicinal pills. Chen Feng even found a few ready-made magic arrays. However, there were none of the high-grade treasures that Chen Feng needed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, as Chen Feng was feeling disappointed, he noticed a square-shaped stone box.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Could it be some immortal-tier secret technique?” Chen Feng joked. However, he knew that it was unlikely to be the case. Opening the box, he saw four fist-sized yao cores.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yao cores. This aura, they are clearly the yao cores from Great Yaos!” Chen Feng’s eyes went wide.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What, Great Yao? Isn’t that the equivalent of a Sky Human stage cultivator?” Lu Ta nearly jumped to his feet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Each of these four yao cores have a different colour. Red, black, yellow and green. There are four different attributes! Although these items are good, the number of cultivators that can directly absorb and refine their energies is small. Despite that, it could still fetch a good price. Of course, I have no plans of selling them because I can absorb their energies,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right, we got lucky this time. Those bandits have been accumulating these treasures for who knows how many years only for them to end up in our hands. With these treasures, our cultivation bases will surely rise by leaps and bounds.” After saying that, Chen Feng began studying the command flags for the ready-made magic arrays.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon, one command flag after another flew out from Chen Feng’s hand to quickly insert themselves into the various corners of the mountain. After the first magic array was successfully set up, strong winds rose up from all directions and clouds rolled about, flowing quickly like lines to engulf the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not stop there. He continued to set up a second magic array, a third magic array, a fourth… again and again until the seventh magic array. Only then did he stop. Although he was not proficient in the art of magic arrays, the command flags for the magic arrays had been fully prepared by others. All Chen Feng needed to do was channel his magic power through them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every time a magic array was set up, some changes would occur to the surroundings of the mountain. Winds rose and clouds surged, lightning flashed and thunder roared, sword energies shone like the rainbow and astral blades rose like a tidal wave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the seven magic arrays were set up, the area around the mountain returned to its normal state. It was as though nothing had happened at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Having finished setting up the magic arrays, Chen Feng regulated his rate of breathing while his consciousness entered the Longevity Tower. As for Lu Ta, he took with him a good number of Magic crystals and began looking for a good place to cultivate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After entering the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng tossed two yao cores towards the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm. There were four yao cores in total. The red one was a fire-type, the yellow one was an earth-type, the green one was a wood-type and the black one was mainly of the dark-type. Water and fire supplemented each other. The ones Chen Feng tossed over to Purplebolt were the black and red yao cores.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yao cores!” Seeing Chen Feng’s appearance earlier, Purplebolt had showed no reaction. At that moment, however, he glided over to bring the two yao cores before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Look at you now. There is not a hint of the majesty of a Great Yao,” Chen Feng could not stop himself from shouting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These are yao cores! The yao cores of Great Yaos!” Purplebolt released an intense wave of divine sense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since you know, don’t waste them. Hopefully, those two yao cores can allow you to overcome Lightning Tribulation.” After saying that, Chen Feng ignored Purplebolt and left the Longevity Tower. He also released Four Ears out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four-eared Spirit Monkey had refined the yao core Chen Feng gave him earlier and his strength churned. Although he was still not at the level of Great Yao, his combat power was already comparable to a level 7 Concealed stage cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“From now on, you will be the guardian animal for this mountain,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After coming out from the Longevity Tower, Four Ears felt very excited and he kept flipping around. Monkeys and apes were an active race of animals, after all. Spending all this time inside the Longevity Tower had been terribly suffocating for the monkey.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This trip’s harvest is quite considerable. I had been worried about the high rate of Magic crystal consumption. To think that the number of Magic crystals would go up again. Now, it is time to cultivate myself.” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
