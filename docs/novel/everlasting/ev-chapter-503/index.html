 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After shredding Mo Xuan’s arm, the suction force continued to pull Mo Xuan’s whole body over. It seemed as though it wanted to shred Mo Xuan into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Xuan gritted his teeth. Power erupted from every part of his body before compressing into a sphere, which then exploded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The explosion blasted Mo Xuan’s body, wounding every part of his body. However, it also succeeded in helping him escape from the devouring black hole. Naturally, it was also due to the fact that the Longevity Tower was not going all out against him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After getting so grievously wounded, Mo Xuan dared not stop. He returned to Yu Xiaojian and grabbed him. Next, sword light enveloped their bodies and they swiftly flew away, disappearing from sight in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the wounded Mo Xuan flee, Chen Feng did not give chase. The most important matter right now was to collect the Mystic Iron ores here.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A Mystic Iron nugget, gleaming with a dark lustre, flew towards Chen Feng, who reached out to grab it. His figure then stumbled as he nearly fell off the tree.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“100,000 kilogrammes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng looked at the palm-sized Mystic Iron nugget in his hand with widened eyes. For such a small Mystic Iron nugget to possess such an outrageous weight, it can only mean one thing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, this is Mystic Ironcore,” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It <em>is</em> Mystic Ironcore.” Tower spoke up and Mystic Ironcore nuggets of various sizes began flying into the Longevity Tower. It did not take long for them to pile up to form a small mountain that was 10 plus metres high.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many Mystic Ironcores!” Chen Feng was shocked. He quickly jumped down from the tree and moved to stand before the pile of Mystic Ironcores. Every one of the Mystic Ironcore nuggets could be sold for a good price in auction houses. And yet, there were over 10,000 of those nuggets piling up in front of him. If he were to convert them all into spirit stones, not even two spirit stone mines would be enough to buy them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is just one tenth of the ores available here. I will be refining the rest for my recovery,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Since these Mystic Ironcores are useful for you, you should just devour them all. At any rate, I do not have much use for them.” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“At least you have a conscience, kid.” Hearing Chen Feng’s words, Tower grew somewhat happy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the end, the Longevity Tower devoured the entire Mystic Iron mine. Occasionally, several more cultivators would come only to instantly die to Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, there is a teleportation array here. Do you want to leave?” After the Mystic Iron mine was cleared out, a teleportation array appeared somewhere deep inside the mine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it the portal to the sixth floor of this tower?” Chen Feng was curious. He did not think that there would be a teleportation array here. Speaking of which, these teleportation arrays were too well-hidden.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t think so,” Tower said after performing an analysis of the teleportation array.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a moment’s consideration, Tower said, “The spiritual energy up ahead is thicker. If we are to go into the details, this Mystic Iron mine is not the best item here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, that makes sense. I believe so too. Say, Tower. There is a Mystic Iron mine here. Will we find a spirit stone mine up ahead?” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is actually possible,” Tower replied seriously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, let’s go check it out. Sigh! There has been no news of Brother Jian. I wonder if he is still inside this tower,” Chen Feng lamented. Next, he emerged from the Longevity Tower. Only then did Chen Feng notice that a massive crater had appeared where the Mystic Iron mine used to be at. The crater had a radius of at least 1,000 zhang and a depth of over 1,000 metres. The Longevity Tower had devoured practically every bit of the Mystic Iron ores there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were still some cultivators there who were simply observing what was going on. However, none of them stepped forward. All of them had witnessed Zhao Feng and Mo Xuan fleeing in wounded states. Even a level 9 Sky Human stage cultivator had been forced to flee. Cultivators who lack the strength – like them – would do well not to go forward and send themselves to death’s door.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was still holding onto the Mystic Ironcore nugget that he had grabbed earlier. As he walked, he channelled his cultivation technique to absorb the power of metal within the nugget.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As strand after strand of the power of metal were refined, the Five Elemental acupoints’ Metal acupoint within Chen Feng’s body began expanding. The change to his Metal acupoint also caused the other Five Elemental acupoints to stir.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I will need to find some magic treasures with special attributes. If I can find magic treasures with the five elemental attributes to safeguard my Five Elemental acupoints, my physical might will probably improve again,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then pointed at a distant cultivator and said, “You, come here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The one he called out was a level 4 Sky Human stage loose cultivator. His cultivation level was far higher than Chen Feng’s cultivation level. However, after Chen Feng called him, he had merely hesitated for a moment before moving over. He had been one of the cultivators who witnessed Chen Feng’s display of might earlier. Even if here were to attempt to run, he would be incapable of escaping Chen Feng’s murderous pursuit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Chen!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite his feelings of apprehension, the cultivator had still chosen to move over. He forced himself to smile ingratiatingly at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng exerted some force through his palm, causing a small piece to break out from the Mystic Ironcore nugget. He then tossed the small piece to the cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mystic Ironcore!” The cultivator’s eyes lit up. However, he quickly suppressed his emotions. He did not understand what Chen Feng was doing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tell me what lies up ahead,” Chen Feng asked. The reason Chen Feng had chosen this particular cultivator was because he had noticed that this cultivator had come from that direction. Thus, he might know something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivator looked at the Mystic Ironcore in his hand. Thinking back on how powerful this God of Slaughter standing before him was, he hesitated for just a moment before answering, “I hear that there is a colossal volcano up ahead and spiritual energy would continuously gush out from its mouth.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it a spirit stone mine?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m not sure. I did not go there myself. I have only heard about it,” the cultivator replied gingerly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The spiritual energy up ahead is so thick and there is the possibility of a spirit stone mine there. So, why did you run over here instead? Is it for the Mystic Iron mine or are you just here to join the liveliness?” Light glinted across Chen Feng’s eyes and cold sweat immediately broke out from the cultivator’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s because it is too dangerous up ahead. Trying to get near the volcano is practically impossible. As it so happens, I heard that a Mystic Iron mine had appeared here. Thus, I came over to join the liveliness,” the cultivator hastily said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is dangerous up ahead? How dangerous?” Chen Feng was slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are yao beasts everywhere and a miasma covers every inch of the place. I hear that there are even Yao Kings standing guard there. A minor cultivator like me can only stay in the peripheral area and pick some medicinal herbs,” the cultivator said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. You can go now.” Chen Feng waved him off. Immediately, the cultivator released a sigh of relief. Standing before Chen Feng had given him too much pressure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Looks like it’s almost certain that there is a spirit stone mine up ahead.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, there are Yao Kings standing guard over it. This is quite troublesome. Tower, given your current level of strength, can you capture a few Yao Kings?” Chen Feng asked after contemplating the matter for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, as long as you can lure them closer. Catching them by surprise is good enough as well,” Tower answered immediately, not hesitating in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lure them closer? Easier said than done. One careless mistake will end with me getting eaten up.” Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, is that a Mystic Ironcore in your hand?” As Chen Feng was secretly chatting with Tower, a cultivator swiftly moved forward to appear before Chen Feng. He stretched his hand out to grab the Mystic Ironcore in Chen Feng’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heh! Someone else wants to die.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng smirked and his palm suddenly pushed forward. A bolt of lightning burst out from his palm and the cultivator was blasted away, blood spraying out from his mouth. He fell to the ground and was no longer capable of getting up. At least, not anytime soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The new arrivals finally recognized Chen Feng. Looks of shock flashed across their faces. Although the cultivator that was beaten back just now was not a formidable character, he was still a level 4 Sky Human stage cultivator. And yet, Chen Feng had beaten him to a near-death state with just one move. While they had indeed heard that Chen Feng had some skills, seeing was believing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is it? Are you fellows also here for the Mystic Iron mine here? A pity, you fellows are too late.” A smile appeared on Chen Feng’s face. Naturally, all the cultivators there could see the ridiculing aspect of his smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened to the Mystic Iron mine here? And how did the battle that was going on here end?” one of the cultivators, a middle-aged fellow, shouted coldly at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why bother exchanging nonsensical words with him? Just capture this kid first. I have heard that Nine Firmaments Palace has increased the bounty for him. Capturing Chen Feng is the equivalent of obtaining a treasure hoard!” A young cultivator could not stop himself from taking action. He waved his hand and a square-shaped seal stamp, shining with star light, smashed down against Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the seal stamp was descending, it spun and grew in size. The starlight shining off its body moved to intersect one another to form layer after layer of net to entrap Chen Feng. Once the nets successfully bound Chen Feng, the descending square-shaped seal would be able to smash Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it’s someone from Star Assembly Sect.” Chen Feng was quick to recognize the pure power of stars contained within the magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The starlight nets swiftly enveloped Chen Feng. Next, the seal stamp – having expanded to a size of a 10-zhang-wide boulder – smashed down on Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, no! Liu Xiyun has taken the lead on this. This is a great opportunity!” Seeing Liu Xiyun make the first move, the others jumped about in regret. In their eyes, Chen Feng was like a Sacred artefact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Liu Xiyun’s attack, Chen Feng scoffed inwardly. The Twin Swords of Life and Death swiftly flew out to circle around him once, slicing away the surrounding starlight nets. Next, the Twin Swords of Life and Death soared upwards. Unleashing two staggered slashes, they instantly cut the square-shaped seal into four pieces. The pieces grew dim, bereft of light, and fell to the ground, smashing out four large craters as they did.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How could this have happened?” Liu Xiyun’s eyes bulged as he sprayed out a mouthful of blood. He screamed out in disbelief. However, before he could finish screaming out his thoughts, he saw a black sword flying towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t kill me! I am from Star Assembly Sect!” Liu Xiyun hastily cried out. Next, however, he sensed his vitality diminishing rapidly. In just one breath’s worth of time, every drop of his vitality had disappeared and his body cracked apart to scatter all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After killing Liu Xiyun, the Twin Swords of Life and Death flew around Chen Feng, circling him continuously. All the cultivators there could see were two beams of light – one white and one black – circling Chen Feng. It gave off a peculiar sensation.</span></p>
