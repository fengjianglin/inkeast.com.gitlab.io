<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two cracking sounds rang out and the Soul and Anima acupoints were opened. Two peculiar yet formidable powers crashed out from the two insight acupoints. When the powers made contact with the power of Soul and Anima within Chen Feng’s body, they became like a cat that had gotten wind of a fishy smell. Immediately, they began to furiously devour the power of Soul and Anima.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was cultivating himself, Jian Xiaotian was secretly standing guard not too far away. Suddenly, however, he sensed two peculiar suction forces emerging from Chen Feng’s body. His own soul stirred and he felt as though his soul and anima were flowing out from his body. This scared Jian Xiaotian, who immediately retracted his soul power and backed away, moving across over 100 metres before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Sii! What happened just now? My soul was nearly sucked away!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Fear lingered within the shocked Jian Xiaotian’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was unaware of what was transpiring outside. He continued to focus on cultivating himself. As usual, after opening his Soul and Anima acupoints, his cultivation base began rising again. This time, however, it wasn’t his fleshly body which grew stronger. Rather, it was his soul power. His Soul and Anima acupoints swiftly linked up to his sea of wisdom and two streams of power then formed a cycle between the sea of wisdom and the Soul and Anima acupoints respectively. Every circulation would cause Chen Feng’s Soulflame to grow one notch stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s body kept emanating waves of formidable aura. Sensing that, Jian Xiaotian became both thoroughly shocked and depressed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just how long has it been since the last breakthrough? He is breaking through again? Is there anymore justice? This is practically the effects of eating an immortal pill! His cultivation base is just blasting sky high here!” Jian Xiaotian could not stop himself from muttering out in a hushed tone. He felt as though his worldview had been terribly hammered, yet again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng cultivated for one whole day and night before waking up. After getting up and sensing the changes to his strength, he became both excited and speechless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, my cultivation base is continuously rising. Will this rate of cultivation become an issue?” Chen Feng said, feeling somewhat concerned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! You think your cultivation base is rising too quickly?” Tower asked with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. As of late, my strength has multiplied several times. Additionally, there is still some time to go before I undergo my Lightning Tribulation. I am feeling somewhat concerned.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! This is nothing. I’ll have you know, in the Immortal Plane, some of the people there are at the Sky Human stage the moment they are born. Rather, some are already at the Human Immortal stage at their moment of birth. Some would take an immortal pill to directly break through tens of levels, rising from the Concealed stage all the way to the Earthen Immortal stage. Thus, your situation is nothing. On the contrary, if you ask me, this rate of cultivation of yours is practically the apex of slowness! Sometimes, I wonder if I will ever be able to return to my prime,” Tower said, chuckling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human Immortal at birth? That’s too outrageous!” Chen Feng was astounded. He had worked bitterly for his cultivation. Not to mention, he’d had many fortunate encounters. Additionally, the cultivation environment within Eternal World was fairly decent while he was practicing a peerless cultivation technique. Despite all that, he had yet to reach the Sky Human stage. And yet, there were those who could reach the Human Immortal stage at birth? How could Chen Feng accept that?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In the beginning, you were just getting by in Black Origin City. Later, you found out that Black Origin City is just as big as a sesame seed within the Northern Plains. As for the Northern Plains, it is considerably inferior compared to the Central Plains. As for this Eternal World, it covers the size of several Central Plains. For you, this Eternal World is already big enough as it is, no? I’ll tell you now, there are many cultivation worlds like Eternal World within the universe. Now, let’s compare this Eternal World with the Immortal Plane. If you shift Eternal World into the Immortal Plane, Eternal World cannot even match up against a small city there,” Tower said while remembering the past.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“At present, you have yet to even step foot out of the Northern Plains. Thus, you still have a long road ahead of you. Originally, I had wanted to only tell you everything after you have ascended to the Immortal Plane. However, since I had promised you, I assure you, as long as you reach the Human Immortal stage, I will tell you everything you want to know,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Last time, you had mentioned that, here in Eternal World, in order to ascend to the Immortal Plane, one must cultivate up to the Ascendant Immortal stage. Is it true?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course. You will understand later on,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! Right now, I have yet to even reach the Sky Human stage. Who knows how long I will need to cultivate up to the Human Immortal stage?” Chen Feng sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! At present, you are already using tribulation lightning from Heavenly Tribulation for your cultivation practice. After you break through to the Sky Human stage, the rate at which you overcome Lightning Tribulation will surely far surpass that of other cultivators.” Tower laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian continued to venture forward while cultivating themselves. Chen Feng had opened up his Life and Death, Soul and Anima acupoints. He had also determined the locations of his other insight acupoints. After stabilizing his sky-rocketing level of strength, he would be able to continue opening the other insight acupoints needed for the Concealed stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the Northern Plains covered a large area, there was a considerable number of cultivators there. Along their way, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian would constantly encounter cultivators who were looking for them. They consisted of loose cultivators and members of some of the great sects. Some cities and checkpoints would have men from Nine Firmaments Palace. Should Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian appear there, they would be detected and those men would rush forward and attempt to either capture or kill them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The past few months had given Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian more shocks than dangers. Thus, their minds slowly relaxed. They thought to themselves: <em>The Northern Plains is so vast. If we are truly determined to hide ourselves, Nine Firmaments Palace would be incapable of finding us, even after 100 years.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the beginning, the two of them would choose to use smaller roads that were rarely used. Later, having grown less tense about it, they would occasionally chat with some loose cultivators and inquire some of the issues occurring within the world of cultivation. Sometimes, they would also enter some small cities to purchase some items.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At any rate, they had changed their faces in order to journey onwards. Seeing through the disguises and recognizing their true identities would require cultivators with high cultivation bases.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>On this particular day, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian decided to take a risk and enter another medium-large city. This city was different from the one they had entered last time. This city was not under any of the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects of the Northern Plains. Rather, it was under the control of loose cultivators. This was a very rare sight in the Northern Plains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This city is known as Starcloud City. It was originally under Star Assembly Sect. Later on, for some unknown reasons, it was given to a group of loose cultivators.” Chen Feng only knew this much about the city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Still, it is a good thing. Nine Firmaments Palace’s influence should not spread this far,” Jian Xiaotian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! We still cannot be careless. Do not forget the bounties on our heads. Even some cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect would take action, let alone the cultivators from the other sects or these loose cultivators who care only about personal interest,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Before coming here, I had never imagined that I would have such a bounty on my head!” Jian Xiaotian could not stop himself from laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After entering Starcloud City, Chen Feng spread out his soul power to vigilantly observe his surroundings. Should something happen, they would immediately take action and carve a bloody path out of the city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This Starcloud City is more than meets the eye. It actually has so many Sky Human stage cultivators. The way I see it, if it is just slightly larger, it could qualify as a large city,” said Jian Xiaotian, who felt somewhat amazed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s actions of continuously sweeping around with his soul power finally angered some cultivators and a sky-encompassing wave of coercion swept towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng anchored his heart and mind, becoming as still as a mountain as he allowed their aura to smash upon his body. As he had already cultivated the Soul Subduing Mantra, even cultivators that were several levels higher than him could forget about easily dealing with him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not think too much about the incident. However, it did not take long for three figures to emerge from the crowd to block their path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ve got trouble,” Jian Xiaotian whispered, sword intent glinting across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s observe first,” Chen Feng replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three fellows standing before Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had young appearances and their bodies emanated a wild aura. Their eyes were sharp and a violent energy flashed across their faces. One glance was sufficient to tell that these fellows were not to be trifled with.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, were you the one using soul power just now?” One of them stepped forward and pointed at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Chen Feng replied calmly. Originally, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had wanted to keep a low profile to not attract the attention of others. However, it would appear that this was no longer a possibility.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s the Three Lu Brothers! &nbsp;These two youngsters are in for it!” someone within the crowd whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This must be the two fellows’ first time here. To think that they would offend those three brothers. Sigh, by relying on the might of the Lu Family, the three of them are used to acting in a domineering manner. I don’t even know how many cultivators have died to the three of them. Now that these two fellows have bumped into them, they would either die or suffer horribly!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shh! Lower your voice! Do you have a death wish?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid! Who do you think you are to not kneel down after seeing the three of us? Do you want us to give you a lesson?” Seeing Chen Feng, the finger that Second Lu Bro had used to point at Chen Feng began jabbing about in the air. Next, streams of strong winds shot out from his finger, enveloping Chen Feng’s face as they shot forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Second Lu Bro had attacked right from the start, shocking Chen Feng. Next, Chen Feng’s figure flashed aside and the attacks missed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Some of the cultivators behind Chen Feng failed to dodge in time and bloody holes instantly appeared on their bodies. Blood flowed out from the holes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How vicious!” Chen Feng sneered, feeling slightly furious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Seeing his attack miss, Second Lu Bro was surprised. However, his face then revealed a savage grin. He abruptly stretched his hand out and his five fingers moved about non-stop. One wind bullet after another shot out like sharp sword beams, creating grazing sounds at they pierced the air. In just an instant, hundreds of the wind bullets flew forward to envelop Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, seemingly desirous of turning them into honeycomb.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of this overbearingly violent attack, Chen Feng simply reached out with his palm to wave his hand. Next, everyone there saw a palm silhouette flash out. After that, the hundred plus wind bullets that Second Lu Bro sent out were all shattered before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s hand swiftly shot out to land on Second Lu Bro’s chest with lightning-like speed. Next, Second Lu Bro gave a wretched scream as his figure was lifted up into the sky before smashing heavily against the city wall tens of metres away. With a plop, he fell to the ground, devoid of life.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators gathering around them were all dumbfounded. Even more so were the other two of the Three Lu Brothers. Big Lu Bro and Third Lu Bro’s eyes were wide open, looks of disbelief on their faces.</span></p>
