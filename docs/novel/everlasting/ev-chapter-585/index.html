 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, you blocked a Human Immortal’s attack?” Jian Qingling cast a shocked look at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We need to hurry up and run. I managed to block it once, but I am not sure if I can do it again,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We need to go save the others first,” Jian Qingwu said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Save the others?” Chen Feng was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The disciples from our sect. After teleporting over, they were captured. My talisman burst earlier and I received a call for assistance. They are not far from here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A sword beam suddenly streaked through the sky to slice away the clouds. It was slashing towards Chen Feng’s group. The sword beam was not too fast. Additionally, it was like layers of moving clouds. Every successive wave was more ferocious than the preceding one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You two go rescue them. I’ll block this fellow!” Chen Feng said, sending the Blood Mustering Bead out again to block this attack. At the same time, the Twin Swords of Life and Death in Chen Feng’s hands began thrumming as it began gathering power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sword beam furiously struck the Blood Mustering Bead, which radiated a blood-red halo of light to block it. However, the Blood Mustering Bead was a broken Dao artefact, after all. With its artefact spirit gone, it could only rely on Chen Feng to operate it. Thus, even though it was able to block the sword beam, it ended up falling down, transforming into a stream of bloody light to flow into Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Heaven Measuring Ruler flew out from Chen Feng’s body to jump into the void. Next, it re-appeared somewhere 10,000 zhang up in the sky. At that moment, the Heaven Measuring Ruler had become several zhang long and it fiercely smashed forward to strike the forehead of a cultivator who was hovering up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another group of cultivators had appeared to stop Chen Feng. In response, Chen Feng swung the Twin Swords of Life and Death in his hands and the power that he had been gathering within the swords burst forward. Sword energy raged outwards like a river of stars and several of the cultivators were instantly blown up by the stream of sword energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knew that the attack he launched earlier had only managed to temporarily repelled the Human Immortal hiding up in the sky. If he were to wait until the Human Immortal arrived, it would be difficult for him to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng kept smacking the cultivators aside. Finally, Chen Feng met up with Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling. At that moment, the two sisters were giving it their all to attack a cave. Layer after layer of restrictive arrays covered the entrance to the cave. Even though the two sisters were already utilizing their Sacred artefacts to attack with all their might, they were still incapable of breaking through into the cave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Without asking, Chen Feng could already guess that there were people inside the cave. Thus, Chen Feng rushed forward and hacked down with his twin swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng take action, Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling grew overjoyed. Although Chen Feng’s cultivation level was lower than theirs’, he possessed many magic treasures. Not to mention, his overall strength was also higher than their overall strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, in the face of Chen Feng’s attacks, many of the restrictive arrays before them started breaking apart. However, Chen Feng ended up frowning. There were many layers of restrictive arrays stacked together there and he could not even tell just how thick they were. Even after attacking eight or ten more times, he was uncertain if he could break through to the cave. Should this continue, the other attacking cultivators would be able to make their way towards them. Additionally, Chen Feng also noticed that the broken restrictive arrays were constantly in the process of recovering. The surrounding streams of spiritual energy were flowing forward, signifying that the restrictive arrays possessed the ability to repair themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I have to use the Blood Mustering Bead again</span></em><span>. Chen Feng shook his head as he mobilized the Blood Mustering Bead to smash into the cave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The power of the Blood Mustering Bead was far stronger compared to the Twin Swords of Life and Death and the layers of restrictive arrays covering the cave were destroyed. At the same time, voices could be heard coming from within the cave. There were actually people attacking the cave from inside as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many of our fellow disciples are imprisoned here!” Jian Qingwu said with a shocked tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The attackers are coming. You two, stop them. I cannot stop now or all my efforts will be in vain.” Chen Feng’s face was somewhat flushed. He spurred the Blood Mustering Bead with everything he had, wanting to smash all the restrictive arrays there in one charge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A massive palm silhouette descended from the sky. The Human Immortal from earlier had arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Twin Swords Unite!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling knew that they were at a critical juncture. Chen Feng’s efforts were needed to break open the restrictive arrays. Thus, after exchanging glances, the two sisters brought their swords out in a uniform manner. The two swords made contact and wave after wave of sword energy charged out from their bodies. The two swords thrummed as the waves of sword energy kept stirring. The tsunami-like sword energy charged skywards to smash furiously against the incoming palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The waves of sword energy were broken apart. However, while the same did happened to the massive palm silhouette, an oppressive power descended and the two sisters flinched. They were forced to back away and they nearly lost their grips on their swords. Their faces turned pale. It was clear that they had ended up suffering slightly from the earlier exchange.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Thankfully, they could block the Human Immortal’s attack.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Although Chen Feng was in the process of breaking through the restrictive arrays, he was also keeping an eye on the two sisters. Seeing Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling block the Human Immortal’s attack, he breathed a sigh of relief. The Blood Mustering Bead’s power rose further.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The final restrictive array was shattered and a dark hole was revealed. Next, one cultivator after another rushed out from the cave, crying out in jubilation as they did.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are so many of them!” Scanning with his divine sense, Chen Feng noted that there were at least 1,000 cultivators inside. All of them were either at the Concealed stage or the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad. They managed to break the captives out.” The Human Immortal expert waved his hand to force Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling back. Waving his hand again, he sent one command flag after another forward. Quickly, the surrounding space there vibrated as countless runes began appearing up in the sky, flying around. It did not take long for waves of pressure to charge forward from every direction towards Chen Feng’s group. It gave them all a suffocating feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is the magic array for the Barrier of the Four Symbols! It’s a great array. Everyone, attack together!” Someone in their group shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Who knows how long these cultivators have been trapped here for? Although a number of them could recover some of their strength, all their magic treasures have been seized away. It will be quite difficult to break out from this great array. Oh, well. I only have myself to blame for being an honorary elder of Heavenly Sword Faction. Besides, on the account of my friendship with Brother Jian, I cannot do nothing</span></em><span>. After considering that, Chen Feng’s palm shook and a bottle of medicinal pills appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There are 100 Hundred Circulation Pills inside this bottle. Although their medicinal power is limited, they should be enough for these people to recover their strength.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The medicinal bottle broke and 100 pills flew into the crowd of cultivators. Next, the cultivators took the medicinal pills. After just one breath, the primary energies within their bodies were already surging vigorously. Their divine senses swept forward with a formidable intensity. They had recovered their lost strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A hundred cultivators had recovered their strength. Thus, a hundred formidable auras shot skyward. At the same time, they attacked the great array around them. The Barrier of the Four Symbols began shaking and the runes hovering in the sky began breaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to the attacks from the cultivators, the Barrier of the Four Symbols began collapsing. However, that would take time. The Human Immortal from Heartless Heaven Sect ignored Jian Qingwu, Jian Qingling and the escaping captives. Instead, he attacked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In his opinion, everything that had transpired this day was all Chen Feng’s fault. Moreover, Chen Feng also possessed a Dao artefact in his hand. It no longer mattered if Chen Feng was a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction or not. The fact that he possessed a Dao artefact alone warranted his capture. For this Human Immortal, a Dao artefact was far more valuable than all of the cultivators present combined, even if the Dao artefact was a broken one.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As long as he could capture Chen Feng, everything he had to go through today would have been worth it. Truth be told, the Human Immortal was of the opinion that Chen Feng was a disciple from Heavenly Sword Faction who had entered the battlefield of Immortal Humans. Otherwise, how else could he be in possession of the Dao artefact?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>You want to attack me? Bring it! Last time I refined a Human Immortal, the Blood Mustering Bead managed to recover some of its functions. Hopefully, I can refine another Human Immortal this time</span></em><span>. Chen Feng gritted his teeth as he planned on duking it out with this Human Immortal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Human Immortal. It was an existence that had truly gone beyond what one could categorize as ordinary cultivators. The ‘Immortal’ word was enough to explain everything. The fundamental difference between the Human Immortal stage and the Sky Human stage was that only those who had broken through to the Human Immortal stage can study the immortal dao laws. It was not something that the worldly laws of the Sky Human stage can hope to match up against. The worldly laws that Sky Human stage cultivators could comprehend were only the laws of the cultivation world that they were residing on. They could only continue to cultivate on the cultivation world that they were occupying. In order to break through the void and cultivate across the cosmos or search for other worlds, the minimum requirement was the Human Immortal stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Still, despite his desire to seize Chen Feng’s Dao artefact, the Human Immortal was still practicing caution. At any rate, it will not be easy to seize a Dao artefact. When his earlier attack was shattered by this Dao artefact, he had ended up taking some damage as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Both his hands abruptly performed a grasping move and an electrical net, formed using lightning, rushed forward to envelop Chen Feng. Those were no ordinary lightning. Rather, they were the tribulation lightning that Human Immortals face during their tribulation. Although the net formed was not a magic treasure, it would still be easy for this net to capture Sky Human stage cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The swords in Chen Feng’s hands danced as he unleashed his sword techniques to break the lightning net. Chen Feng knew what the Human Immortal was thinking. Thus, he did not utilize the Blood Mustering Bead. Instead, he utilized the Twin Swords of Life and Death to fight this move. He wanted to buy time for the cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction to escape. That way, it would be easier for him to escape as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s plan was good. However, Heartless Heaven Sect would never allow the cultivators to escape. The cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect rushed forward, killing intent soaring out from them as they brandished their magic treasures.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Originally, we wanted to keep you fellows alive. However, now that you fellows have broken out, there is only death waiting for you. Everyone, attack! Kill them all!” A half-step Human Immortal from Heartless Heaven Sect shouted, his voice reverberating outwards like thunder. He was the first to take action. A seal stamp flew out from his hand, becoming like a small mountain as it smashed down heavily. Instantly, two cultivators were killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction had managed to break out, none of them had their magic treasures anymore. Meanwhile, the well-equipped cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect kept attacking them and the cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction kept dying. Moreover, Heartless Heaven Sect also had several half-step Human Immortals on their side. These figures were very ruthless and every attack their unleashed would kill off at least one cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t need help! Hurry up and lead the others away from here!” Seeing Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling moving over to help him, Chen Feng promptly sent them a secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was a Human Immortal he was up against. Additionally, Chen Feng could clearly sense that this Human Immortal was not to be underestimated. He must have broken through to the Human Immortal stage for quite some time now. In the event that Chen Feng could not defeat this Human Immortal, he could figure out some way to escape. However, the two sisters might end up causing trouble for him instead if they were to come over.</span></p>
