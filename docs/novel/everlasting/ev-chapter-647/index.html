 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Demonic Heavengorging Art! How is this possible? You are just a human!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A look of dread appeared within the Demon King’s eyeball. Instinctively, it had recognized the technique that Chen Feng was utilizing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demonic Heavengorging Art, the cultivation technique of the Divine Heavengorging Beasts, the members of the imperial clan of the Demon Plane. It possessed an innate ability to suppress and counter every creature from the Demon Plane. Although this Demonic One-eyed Lizard had been residing within this ancient battlefield, its blood contained the imprints of the Demon Plane. Naturally, that meant that it was incapable of escaping the suppressive effects of the Demonic Heavengorging Art.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was not a difference in strength. Rather, it was something set in place deep within its heart. One such example would be a hare in the face of a tiger bereft of claws and fangs. Despite the lack of claws and fangs on the tiger, the hare would still feel fearful towards the tiger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thankfully for the Demonic One-eyed Lizard, it was a Demon King. If it were on the same cultivation level as Chen Feng, it would have no courage to resist the suppressive effects of the Demonic Heavengorging Art.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the Demonic One-eyed Lizard was still feeling fearful, it was able to rely on its formidable power to resist. It struggled with all it had to suppress the fear in its heart in an attempt to extricate itself from the effects of the Demonic Heavengorging Art that Chen Feng was utilizing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Upon its success in extricating itself, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard would quickly flee.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Go all out to kill Chen Feng and snatch the cultivation technique for the Demonic Heavengorging Art? The thought had never even crossed its mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only the rulers of the Demon Plane, the Divine Heavengorging Beasts, could cultivate the Demonic Heavengorging Art. As for how a human could end up learning this secret technique, the Demon King could not be bothered to ponder the question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that very moment, running away was of paramount importance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This guy is a Demon King, after all. It is even more powerful compared to the average Human Immortal. And yet, it is trying to run away without even going all out? Looks like the Demonic Heavengorging Art is truly the counter to all demonic beasts. A pity, the one I practice is only the fragment of a fragment. I wonder when I will be able to practice a whole Demonic Heavengorging Art,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite the thoughts in his mind, Chen Feng knew that this was the best opportunity for him to finish off this Demon King. Even if he could not kill it off, he must do his best to suck away its power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was a Demon King that had cultivated an eye technique. Chen Feng was certain, by devouring its eye power, his eye technique would level up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Adding the power of his Magic Eyes of Darkness and the power of this Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s eyeball, Chen Feng’s eye power would exceed all the other secret techniques that he had cultivated out in the past.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Still, this Demonic One-eyed Lizard was a Demon King. Despite having used the Demonic Heavengorging Art, killing it off easily was practically impossible for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, after a furious round of struggle, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard managed to extricate itself. Next, its massive body transformed into a dashing silhouette as it fled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After all that, would Chen Feng give up? This was his ticket to levelling up his eye technique! Without any hesitation, Chen Feng gave chase.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demonic One-eyed Lizard moved quickly and it did not take long for it to cover a distance of over 50 kilometres. However, Chen Feng was no slouch either. Sword light flashed out all over his body as he pursued the Demonic One-eyed Lizard closely. It looked as though there were two lines of light streaking through the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There was no way to tell just how big the rocky desert was. Chen Feng had already been chasing the Demonic One-eyed Lizard for over 500 kilometres. In the outside world, this was the equivalent of the length of a mid-sized empire. And yet, Chen Feng was still incapable of seeing the ends of this stretch of rocky desert.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had already given it his all. Even so, there was still a distance of tens of li between him and the Demonic One-eyed Lizard. Still, Chen Feng was not feeling too concerned. He calmly pursued the Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Let’s see where you can run off to,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought. At any rate, he had only just entered this world. There were still many things that he did not know. This was a good opportunity for him to figure it out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Additionally, Chen Feng did not believe that the Demonic One-eyed Lizard would keep on running. He was also aware that something else would happen. He could already sense the presence of other cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There is no signal from the jade talisman. I wonder which sect those fellows are from,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered, slowing down slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators had been lured over by the auras emanating out from Chen Feng and the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s bodies. Upon their arrival, they gaped in shock as they watched a Demon King, its body exuding surging streams of demonic energy, flee from a cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I remember that fellow. He is from Heavenly Sword Faction.” When they saw Chen Feng, the eyes of one of the two cultivators lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Humph! Two level 9 Sky Human stage cultivators. There is nothing to fear</span></em><span>. Chen Feng had merely given them a glance before choosing to ignore them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are from Divine Demon Grotto?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are from the Dongfang Family. I didn’t think that the Dongfang Family would also be able to get some spots for this.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are no treasures here. I think there is no need for us to attack.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally, I am going to follow them and see what’s up. Are you interested?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Alright. There is no resentment between our Dongfang Family and your Divine Demon Grotto. Let’s join forces. Hopefully, we’ll be able to get some benefits.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After flying across another 250 kilometres, the Demon King furiously dove, moving underground. In just a flash, its figure had disappeared. It was like a drop of water falling upon the sand. It did not even give rise to a trace of dust.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>An impressive earthslip technique. However, it’s strange. Why run all the way here before slipping underground?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng stopped, landing on the ground before assessing his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Flat terrain. With the exception of some sporadically scattered rocks, there was nothing special there. However, looking down the ground, Chen Feng immediately discovered something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Layer after layer of restrictive arrays were densely packed together underground. It went deep into the ground. Chen Feng, who was utilizing his eye technique to assess the ground, was shocked to find that his eye technique was quickly blocked by the many layers of restrictive arrays under the ground. He could forget about investigating what was beneath using his eye technique.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There is something peculiar about these restrictive arrays.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After simply considering it for a moment, Chen Feng displayed an earthslip technique as well to slip underground. He slowly descended as he inspected the restrictive arrays.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In Chen Feng’s opinion, the restrictive arrays were very complex and sophisticated. It held true for each individual restrictive array and just as true for the way they were intertwined with each other. If it weren’t for the fact that Chen Feng was chasing after the Demonic One-eyed Lizard, it would have taken him longer to make it past the many layers of restrictive arrays. In fact, he might end up getting trapped by them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These restrictive arrays are definitely not the handiwork of the Demon King.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was quick to determine that. Speaking of which, Yao Kings and Demon Kings aside, even those at the Great Yao and Great Demon stage would possess wisdom comparable to that of humans. Some special yaos or demons could possess wisdom surpassing that of humans. An example of that would be those specializing in illusions or mental techniques.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for this Demonic One-eyed Lizard, the earlier battle had proven to Chen Feng that it was indeed formidable. It was capable of beating Chen Feng to the point of him coughing out blood. However, it was also clear that it did not possess much in terms of wisdom. Rather, it seemed as though it was only fighting based on instinct.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Chen Feng did feel puzzled about it, he did not dwell too much on it. He was presently more interested in the restrictive arrays in front of him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Could there be some ancient remains down there?</span></em><span>&nbsp;He was presently within an ancient battlefield of Immortal Humans. Finding some legacies or wondrous areas here was a common occurrence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was making his way through the many layers of restrictive arrays, Tower remained silent. He curiously observed what was happening outside, light gleaming across his eyes non-stop. It seemed he was recalling something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Chen Feng came to a halt. He had lost track of the Demonic One-eyed Lizard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had actually lost track of it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He brought forth all of his soul power to bear, but the restrictive array right below him stopped it. Despite trying several times, Chen Feng failed to get past it. In fact, he ended up triggering a counter attack from the restrictive array once.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the counter attack was not highly damaging, the pliable power within it nearly tied Chen Feng up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Is my power no longer sufficient to break them anymore?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s eyes kept flashing and black streams of light rapidly swept his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I am already over 1,000 zhang below ground. Who would be bored enough to set up so many layers of restrictive arrays here? Hopefully, there are good items down below</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Here!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Chen Feng found a weak point within the layer of restrictive array. Bringing out Bloody Soul, he stabbed forward to create a small hole upon the restrictive array. Next, his figure flashed forward, going past the barrier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had only just made his way through the barrier when countless bolts of lightning streaked towards him. The thick, innumerable bolts of lightning made Chen Feng think that he had walked into a Lightning Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This doesn’t look like Sky Lightning.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Bloody Soul flashed about to shatter apart the bolts of lightning. Next, Chen Feng quickly made a grasping motion and the lightning powers around him converged upon his palm to form a rapidly spinning ball of lightning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, even more lightning bolts streaked towards Chen Feng and Chen Feng felt as though he had fallen into a sea of lightning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng squeezed and the ball of lightning in his hand blew up. The formidable explosion shook Chen Feng slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The destructive power behind these bolts of lightning is comparable to my previous Lightning Tribulation</span></em><span>. Chen Feng shook his head. Waving his hand, he created a massive, black-coloured vortex in front of him. A formidable suction force emerged and the surrounding bolts of lightning became like rivers flowing into the sea as they all surged into the vortex.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The vortex was connected to the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Once again, Chen Feng created yet another lightning pool inside the Longevity Tower. To Chen Feng’s surprise, the amount of lightning powers there was simply too much. It did not take long for the lightning pool he created to be filled. Next, the lightning pool slowly expanded in size.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, Tower! As I recall, the amount of Sky Lightning absorbed in the previous Lightning Tribulation is not as much as this.” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower ignored Chen Feng. Instead, he stretched his hand out and grasped. Chen Feng watched as a faint, bluish-green palm silhouette appeared all of a sudden. It inserted itself into the lightning powers before Chen Feng and grasped. Next, all the lightning powers outside disappeared, absorbed completely by the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was shocked. Then, he noticed Tower playing with a fist-sized bead inside the Longevity Tower. The bead was flashing with lightning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is that?” Chen Feng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lightning Bead!” Tower’s answer was very succinct.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it a magic treasure?” Chen Feng felt somewhat delighted. It hadn’t been too long since he entered. And yet, he had already come across a treasure. In his opinion, something that could contain so much lightning powers was definitely no ordinary object.</span></p>
