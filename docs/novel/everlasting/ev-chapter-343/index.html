 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Quickly, the three of them flew over 400 kilometres before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! That was extremely dangerous. We were nearly killed. I didn’t think such a powerful fellow would appear,” Jian Xiaotian said, his voice containing a lingering sense of fear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian’s strongest attack had been incapable of breaking the Earthen Bear’s defensive techniques. Due to that, an inevitable feeling of dejection beset him. Even his will to fight had fallen somewhat. However, he felt thankful that he could escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thank you for the assistance,” Chen Feng thanked the young cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Even if I hadn’t taken action, the Earthen Bear would not have been able to capture you two. No wonder you two dare enter this place. It turns out you have top-grade magic treasures as a means of protection,” the young cultivator said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are just borrowing the power of items. We are no match for your profound cultivation base. My name is Chen Feng, a disciple from Extreme Celestial Sect. This here is Jian Xiaotian.” Chen Feng smiled as he kept the Fire Wyrm Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, given Chen Feng’s present level of strength, it was impossible for him to unleash so much of the Fire Wyrm Sword’s power, let alone harm the Earthen Bear. During that critical moment, Tower had assisted him by injecting a stream of power into the Fire Wyrm Sword to temporarily activate the sword’s power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lin Shaokun. I am just a loose cultivator,” the young cultivator said. When he let the gilded staff make contact with the ground, Chen Feng felt the ground tremble slightly. He could not stop himself from wondering how heavy the staff was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Brother Lin, did you come here to train yourself as well?” Jian Xiaotian stepped forward and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am not here for training. I just need some yao cores.” When he said that, Lin Shaokun’s face turned solemn.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yao cores? I have some with me.” After saying that, Chen Feng brought out three yao cores. One of them was from the Wolf King they killed earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are too kind, Brother Chen. However, I will hunt for the yao cores myself,” Lin Shaokun said, rejecting the offer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Lin, don’t say no. Having these items will not make any difference for me. However, it seems like Brother Lin needs them very much,” Chen Feng said, adamantly shoving the yao cores into Lin Shaokun’s hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, I will not reject. Truth be told, I require a great deal of yao cores. That is why I decided to enter the Seven Kills Direlands.” Lin Shaokun’s face revealed a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you sure are generous,” Tower spontaneously said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This fellow is worth befriending,” Chen Feng replied with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder, why are you two here? If you need any help, don’t hesitate to ask. I am very familiar with the Seven Kills Direlands,” Lin Shaokun said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, is that so? I came here to find Dire Meridian Grass. Do you know where I can find it?” Shocked, Chen Feng then asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dire Meridian Grass? This spiritual herb can be found in many places within the Seven Kills Direlands. For example, if you venture another 1,000 kilometres inside, Dire Meridian Grasses, Seven Poisons Grasses, Seven Extremities Grasses, Blood Dissolution Grasses and various other spiritual herbs can be found everywhere,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many?” Chen Feng was pleasantly surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, that place is too dangerous. I advise against going there. Back then, I took the risk of venturing into the place and had nearly failed to escape. If I am not mistaken, there should be a Yao King safeguarding the place,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yao King!” Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian exchanged glances, looks of shocks appearing on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is said that there are seven Yao Kings in the Seven Kills Direlands. I wonder if it is true?” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It should be,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, I’ll forget about going there. The high chance of dying there makes it not worthwhile,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No need to worry, Brother Chen. I know of another place with Dire Meridian Grasses. However, there is a bunch of venomous snakes there. Although I had gone there a few times before, I was never able to gain the upper hand. However, with your assistance, we will surely succeed in beating them,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Venomous snakes? What kind of venomous snakes?” Jian Xiaotian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Seven Demise Vipers,” Lin Shaokun said seriously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s the Seven Demise Vipers?” Jian Xiaotian cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? Brother Jian, you know about these venomous snakes?” asked Chen Feng, who was standing beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These snakes are very powerful. Their venom is very toxic and they can shoot out seven types of venom. Every one of the venoms is extremely valuable in the world of cultivation. Seven Demise Vipers at the yao beast stage can poison a Sky Human stage cultivator to death. More importantly, these highly venomous creatures band together. According to some of the records that I have read before, it is mentioned that the largest Seven Demise Viper nest encountered houses at least one billion Seven Demise Vipers inside.” Jian Xiaotian recalled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One billion? Is that true? Or is it just a myth?” Chen Feng was in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! The place mentioned in the book does exist. However, I have never gone there before. It is the infamous Snake Island within the Central Plains. It is also a danger zone. Ha ha! Danger wise, it is above the Seven Kills Direlands,” Jian Xiaotian said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Snake Island. So, it is in the Central Plains.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have heard of the place before. I have heard that there are countless venomous snakes on Snake Island. It is said that some of them had even cultivated up to the Yao Immortal stage. I wonder if that is true?” Lin Shaokun suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yao Immortal?” A look of curiosity flashed across Chen Feng’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, how high is this Yao Immortal stage?” Chen Feng secretly asked Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Yao Immortal stage is right above the Yao King stage. This stage has surpassed the Human Immortal stage. It is the equivalent of the Earthen Immortal stage,” Tower said quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“An existence above Human Immortal? Unimaginable! Unimaginable!” Chen Feng felt his heart stirring. At any rate, his cultivation base was too low. He had yet to even cultivate up to the Sky Human stage. Thus, this was something far beyond him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If it’s the Seven Demise Vipers, it won’t be easy. Right, Brother Lin, how many Seven Demise Vipers are there and what level are they at?” Jian Xiaotian asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is a snake nest there. I do not know the exact number. However, several of the snakes have reached the Great Yao stage. Back then, I was going after the Earthroot Grasses that are growing somewhere near the snake nest. Unexpectedly, just as I was about to reach the grasses, a whole coil of those venomous snakes rushed at me. Due to how unprepared I was, I accidentally inhaled some of their venom. In the end, I had to fight against three Seven Demise Vipers at the Great Yao stage. After killing one of them, I ran away.” Lin Shaokun recounted the battle between him and the Seven Demise Vipers in detail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Earthroot Grasses? Those are good items.” Chen Feng’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course they are good. All who cultivate earth-type cultivation techniques dream of obtaining it.” Jian Xiaotian laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, let’s do it! Even if there are no Dire Meridian Grasses there, we should try doing it for the Earthroot Grasses,” Chen Feng said, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have no objections. Even though I cannot use it, I can sell them for a good price,” Jian Xiaotian said, nodding his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the three of them were done with their discussion, they set off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The place that Lin Shaokun mentioned was over 250 kilometres away. As the three of them were advancing, they discussed their plan of action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their objective were the Earthroot Grasses and Dire Meridian Grasses. Chen Feng had made up his mind. Once he got his hands on the Dire Meridian Grasses, he would immediately return to the sect to be promoted to core disciple. Then, he could focus on his preparations for the competition.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A pity. If only I can kill off that Earthen Bear, I would have enough,” Lin Shaokun suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, Brother Lin. Don’t begrudge me for asking too much, but why do you need so many yao cores? Do you want to concoct medicinal pills?” Chen Feng asked quizzically.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is more or less for pill concoction,” Lin Shaokun said coolly. There was a troubled look on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Lin Shaokun’s expression, Chen Feng knew that he was facing a troubling issue that he could not reveal to others. Thus, Chen Feng stopped probing and instead changed the topic of discussion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Not long after that, Lin Shaokun halted his steps. “They are in the hill up ahead.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Indeed, there is a faint poisonous energy in the air.” Jian Xiaotian frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This poisonous energy can easily kill off ordinary humans.” After saying that, Chen Feng brought out three Poison Prevention Pills and the three of them took one respectively.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although this level of poison cannot affect us, it is better to be careful,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, you know how to concoct pills?” asked a curious Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not even a little. However, I have prepared many types of medicinal pills for emergencies,” Chen Feng replied smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, how many venomous snakes are there?” Chen Feng secretly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t know. Just check it on your own,” Tower replied lazily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he.” Chen Feng simply chuckled. He did not ask Tower anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt that he had unknowingly grown too reliant on Tower. This was not a good thing. While magic treasures were important, he should always rely on his own power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The hill was not too large. It could only be considered a relatively higher slope from afar. As the three of them gradually approached the hill, a noxious smell wafted over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng attempted to inhale some of it and was immediately assailed by a sense of dizziness. Next, he circulated his primary energy to unravel the poisonous energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a potent poisonous energy!” Chen Feng was somewhat shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Without the Poison Prevention Pills, those below the Sky Human stage would find it hard to reach this place. Rather, even Sky Human stage cultivators cannot spend too long here,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun then reached his hand out to pluck up a few herbs from the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Herbs capable of growing in this environment are no ordinary plants. These are Cold Spirit Grasses. They grow in areas with poisonous energy and possess the detoxification function,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are several Poison Dispelling Fruits here as well. These are all good items.” Jian Xiaotian too, picked up several round fruits, each the size of a fingernail.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Back then, I was attracted over after seeing these herbs,” Lin Shaokun said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The venomous snakes are coming out so soon.” After saying that, Chen Feng’s hand abruptly stretched out and a two-chi-long, multi-coloured snake was caught by Chen Feng and lifted into the air. There it stayed, incapable of moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a Seven Demise Viper,” Lin Shaokun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Too weak. This one is not even at the yao beast stage.” After saying that, Chen Feng waved his hand and the Seven Demise Viper fell to the ground, motionless. Chen Feng had already unleashed a blast of energy to kill it off earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Follow the plan we came up with earlier. I will head forward and lure away the few Seven Demise Vipers at the Great Yao stage while you two make use of the opening to collect the various spiritual herbs. I’ll say it again. Do not fight them head on. If it is not looking good, hurry up and run. There is no need to go all out against these venomous creatures,” Lin Shaokun said, nodding towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. Next, his figure darted forward. After jumping forward a few times, his figure disappeared into the hill.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, I can get something this time. If not, I will capture some Seven Demise Vipers and raise them. Making them guardian animals for the grotto-mansion is not a bad choice,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
