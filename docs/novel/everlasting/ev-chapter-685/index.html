 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the two of them kept descending, the streams of malevolent energy spraying out from below grew thicker and thicker. Correspondingly, the death energy within them grew in strength as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The streams of death energy were like living creatures, constantly coursing through the streams of malevolent energy, seemingly in search of living creatures to devour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the death energy was a huge supplementary item for Chen Feng. Putting aside the Death Sword, which was furiously devouring the surrounding death energy, even the Death acupoint within his body was spinning into action.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Speaking of which, although Chen Feng had opened up both the Life and Death acupoints. The one that he would cultivate the most was the Life acupoint. At any rate, the worldly spiritual energy and the spiritual energy within spirit stones contained thriving life energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to that, the Life and Death acupoints had fallen into a state of imbalance. Even the Twin Swords of Life and Death were affected somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Operating the Death acupoint to absorb the surrounding death energy, Chen Feng quickly felt both life and death energies moving in a cycle between the Life and Death acupoints. Every cycle would cause his vitality to grow even stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>As expected, the benefit produced from the melding of life and death, two fundamental powers, far exceeds that of me absorbing only one type of power.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Sensing the changes within his body, Chen Feng felt delighted. He did not rush going down. Instead, he focused on devouring the surrounding death energy, which grew thicker and thicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Observing Chen Feng devour the surrounding death energy, Jian Xiaotian was secretly alarmed. He did not understand what kind of cultivation technique Chen Feng was practicing. Even for a Human Immortal, absorbing and unravelling death energy would require quite a bit of effort. Absorbing and making the death energy part of their own power, on the other hand, was somewhat unrealistic, unless he or she was cultivating a special cultivation technique.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After descending through over 1,000 metres, the two of them were finally attacked by some monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The first monster they encountered was a strange-looking, ape-like monster. The monster’s body was enveloped by a layer of thick malevolent energy. With the exception of its scarlet eyes, all other aspects of the monster were somewhat hazy to the eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Moreover, this monster’s style of attack was also very special. Following its sharp cry, a tangible halo of light swept towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, before the halo of light could even get close to Chen Feng, it transformed before flowing into the Death Sword in Chen Feng’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It is probably using death energy to attack. I wonder what kind of creature it is? Could it have been growing here all this time?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian fired out a sword beam to cut the monster in half. However, no flesh and blood scattered. Instead, the monster was simply hacked apart like a piece of withered wood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Upon its death, the strands of death energy covering its body began dissipating to quickly reveal the monster’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s an ancient Scarletblaze Ape. It grows in molten lava. I didn’t think we could encounter one here. Looks like it was corrupted by the malevolent energy here,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scarletblaze Ape. I did read about it in some ancient books before. This yao beast innately possesses fire-type attacks. Its fleshly body is strong and agile. However, it is clear that this one has been corrupted by the malevolent energy to the point of losing its mind. It could not even unleash 10% of the power it should possess.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, the two of them continued encountering more monsters enveloped in malevolent energy. Some were Scarletblaze Apes and some were other types of yao beasts. Rather, there were also some demonic beasts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is an Icerock Turtle. It possesses the blood of the Black Tortoise.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is an Earthen Armoured Snake.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This Earthsplitter Python is already at the half-step Yao King stage. How dangerous! I nearly got hit,” Jian Xiaotian said, a lingering note of fear in his voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, a massive python had suddenly appeared to unleash a suction force upon him and his soul nearly flew out as a result. If it weren’t for Chen Feng, who attacked the python, he would have had to figure a way to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s a little strange. These few yao beasts are not affected by the death energy. Moreover, they can also unleash their innate skills, using them in tandem with the death energy contained within the malevolent energy. Due to that, their combat powers grew even stronger. Looks like there are some issues with our previous speculation,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The number of corrupted monsters they encountered kept increasing and Chen Feng finally found the way to deal with the monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His Death acupoint operating, Chen Feng reached out with his hand to grasp. While also utilizing the Demonic Heavengorging Art, he exerted a formidable suction force to instantly pull out the death energy from the bodies of the few demonic beasts before him. The streams of death energy were then sucked into Chen Feng’s Death acupoint.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the demonic beasts that were pouncing forward promptly stopped what they were doing. Every one of them became like a wooden puppet as they fell down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As expected, after losing the death energy on them, the creatures here won’t even have the most basic of instincts left in them. They are no different from creatures corrupted by demonic energy,” Chen Feng said, analysing their situation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, pulling out the death energy out from these monsters is not an easy feat.” While Jian Xiaotian’s combat ability was quite decent, he was incapable of directly drawing out the death energy from the monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My cultivation technique just happens to be effective against them,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was the truth. As Chen Feng had opened up the Death acupoint, he could devour death energy on his own. Add the Demonic Heavengorging Art into the equation, he could counter these demonic beasts. Thus, Chen Feng was able to easily handle the enemies there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, the two of them landed on a platform. Though, rather than call it a platform, it would be more accurate to call it a hole within the steep walls.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, medicinal herbs were growing within this place, which was filled with thick malevolent energy. Thick stems and tough leaves, the plants were capable of radiating a faint lustre even in the midst of the malevolent energy. Rather, there was even a faint scent of medicinal aroma in the air. That was also how Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were attracted to the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian stepped forward to pluck one of the medicinal herbs and he said with a smile, “This is a Mind Eater Grass! It is at least 1,000 years old. It is very rare thing in the outside world.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it’s the Mind Eater Grass. A pity, it is not the Mind Guard Grass. Still, that is pretty good. It can be used to concoct some special medicinal pills. It is especially attractive for body cultivators. Even if I don’t end up using it, I can also change it for some spirit stones,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were 36 stalks of Mind Eater Grasses and the two of them quickly divided the grasses amongst them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha, we sure are lucky! The ones who came down before us did not collect these grasses away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are many cracks here. Not to mention, our divine senses are restricted here. It is not impossible for the cultivators to miss out on some of the items here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder what other good items are there down below?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, we can meet that Zhan Qingfeng. If we do, we must kill him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian continued to descend. Occasionally, they would meet some corrupted yaos and demons and occasionally, they would pick up some spiritual herbs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, they never encountered any other cultivators. They did not even see any traces of other cultivators on their way down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Something is wrong. The other cultivators aside, Zhan Qingfeng also came down this crack. However, there isn’t any trace of him at all.” After saying that, Chen Feng brought out the Thousand Seeker Mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The surface of the mirror kept flashing with light. It did not take long for Chen Feng to furrow his brows. Next, the Thousand Seeker Mirror abruptly shone brilliantly before turning dim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” Jian Xiaotian was surprised by that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The space here is very unstable. Or perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that a certain power has distorted it. The level of my Thousand Seeker Mirror is not high enough. It cannot figure anything out. Moreover, when I sent out my soul power to investigate our surroundings, it found some issues with the space here as well.” Chen Feng closed his eyes and contemplated for a moment before continuing, “Given our current level, we are still incapable of comprehending the laws of space and time. However, I think what we entered is a simple crack. Only, this crack contains a dimension of its own.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A spatial dimension? No, it is most likely a spatial distortion, folds in space.” Jian Xiaotian tried to express his view of the situation in the most simplistic manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No matter. Having a harvest is the best.” After saying that, Chen Feng reached out with his hand to smack the wall beside him. With a booming sound, his move blasted open a hole and a thick stream of medicinal aroma wafted out. There was actually a cavern there. Inside the cavern were spiritual herbs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Amazing! We’ve hit the jackpot!” Jian Xiaotian grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One glance revealed that there were over 100 spiritual herbs that were over 1,000 years old. There were also some other rare spiritual herbs that they had only seen in books.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian was the first to rush in. However, he did not let his guard down. He released his soul power to inspect the cavern.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is like paradise! I wonder, how could such a place form deep underground?” Jian Xiaotian stared at all the spiritual herbs before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cavern was as big as a valley, with a radius of 1,000 zhang. It was already comparable to a small city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is nothing else but some spiritual herbs,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng activated his eye technique and his eyes swept the place. It did not take long before he finished his investigation of the cavern.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is nothing else here.” As Chen Feng was about to retract his gaze, he suddenly felt the malevolent energy within the place surging slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Instantly, his heart gave a thump and he said, “Careful! Something is wrong here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As he said that, a black silhouette emerged from the streams of malevolent energy, flashing forward to arrive before Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cut!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian shouted in a hushed tone while quickly slashing out with his sword at the black silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A loud colliding sound rang out and Jian Xiaotian was knocked back while the black silhouette remained unscathed. It continued pouncing towards Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this thing?!” Chen Feng was shocked. Two black streams of light flew out from his eyes, quickly elongating to form two silk-like threads, which moved to instantly entangle the black silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A corrosive sound rang out. Then, with a banging sound, the dark threads that Chen Feng sent out were snapped apart. The black silhouette stopped targeting Jian Xiaotian and instead turned to pounce at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng remained immobile. However, black streams of light kept shooting out from his eyes. That was the Shackles of Darkness move from his Magic Eyes of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Strands of black threads sealed up his surroundings to quickly bind the black silhouette once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Once again, the threads created by the Shackles of Darkness were quickly corroded. This technique could easily capture a half-step Human Immortal. Even a Human Immortal would have to be cautious in dealing with this move. Unexpectedly, it would prove ineffective.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, have a taste of my Immortal-binding Rope!” Chen Feng swung and a golden stream of light flowed forward. With just a few turns, it had firmly tied up the black silhouette.</span></p>
