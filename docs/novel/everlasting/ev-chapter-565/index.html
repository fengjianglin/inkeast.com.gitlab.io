 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These fellows are moving so quickly. Not to mention, I can see killing intent in their eyes. They are definitely on their way to do something. Well, I have nothing better to do right now. Might as well go check it out for fun.</span></em><span>&nbsp;After making up his mind, Chen Feng moved to quickly follow them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After following them through a lengthy distance, Chen Feng finally sensed combat shockwaves coming from up ahead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The one-horned beasts sped up, transforming into streams of light as they charged forward. After arriving at the battlefield, they did not attack. Instead, they spread out in a circle. The one-horned beasts and their riders were gathering their strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, who was hiding himself there, could clearly see everything that was transpiring. There were tens of cultivators in bronze-coloured armour besieging two young female cultivators. They fought to kill and streams of spiritual energy roiled about. Large craters could be seen on the ground. The corpses scattered over the ground and the two female cultivators’ gasping actions revealed that the fight had been going on for quite a while now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Of the two female cultivators, one was dressed in red while the other was dressed in white. Both were tall and graceful, with slender legs, wasp-like waists and curvy bodies. Additionally, they were both beautiful. More importantly, they looked identical. No questions were needed to know that the two of them were identical twins. Chen Feng, who was hiding in the dark, nodded. He did not think that he would be able to encounter such characters right after stepping foot into the Central Plains. Even so, Chen Feng knew that these two female characters were extraordinary characters. Their high cultivation bases aside, he could see sword luminescence flashing continuously within their eyes. Add the astral swords swirling around them, the atmosphere of beauty they gave off contained coldness, allure and slaughter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Pure sword cultivators. Their sword intent feels somewhat familiar. I wonder, are they disciples from Heavenly Sword Faction?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Jian Qingwu, Jian Qingling! Are you two still going to be stubborn about this? Hand over the item and we will not trouble you any further. Why bother resisting until we capture you two? Or do the two of you really want to fall into my clutches?” said a young cultivator with the air of a young master with a chuckle. He rode a pure-white one-horned beast, which stood outside the encirclement. His eyes stared at the twins who were in the midst of fighting, a devious light shining off them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Zhan Qingsong! If you have what it takes, then come fight us in a one-on-one battle! If I lose, I can hand over the item. However, you are now using numbers to fight us. Is this how your Warlord Pavilion operates?” the red-dressed female cultivator shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Provoking me is useless. Just consider yourselves unlucky today. The number of people on my side is getting higher and higher. When I lose my patience, not even begging for mercy would help. Of course, I have a soft spot for females. I really can’t bring myself to destroy beauties. You two should just hand over the item and follow me back. When I have obtained the legacy, I will be sure to treat you two well,” the young master, Zhan Qingsong said with a devilish and lackadaisical smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nonsense! Even if Zhan Tianhen is here, he wouldn’t have the guts to say that. Who do you think you are?” the red-dressed female cultivator shouted icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Skyjade Lightsplitter Sword Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling turned to look at each other. Next, they sprayed out a mouthful of blood essence at the same time. The swords swirling around them immediately shone with an even greater luminescence, their power rising several folds. Screams rang out and three of the cultivators besieging them were killed, their corpses falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pushing yourself beyond your limits? I would like to see how far you two can go. You have the easy way out, but you want to take the hard way? When you fall into my hands, I will let you two suffer a fate worse than death!” An insidious glint flashed across Zhan Qingsong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows, attack!” Zhan Qingsong gave the order to the 20 cultivators who arrived earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Jian Qingwu, Jian Qingling and Skyjade Splitterlight Sword Technique. They are most likely from Heavenly Sword Faction. As for the young master known as Zhan Qingsong, he is from Warlord Pavilion. I did hear that these two sects are at war with one another. It is only normal for their disciples to get into disputes. However, does this Zhan Qingsong really want to just snatch their items, or does he have another motive?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng continued hiding in the dark as he observed it all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling. Not only were they younger than Jian Xiaotian, they were also a few years younger compared to Chen Feng. And yet, they were already level 8 Sky Human stage cultivators. The sword energies within their bodies were pure while their sword intent was unshakeable. They had accomplished quite a lot in the path of sword cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How unexpected. These two twin sisters are so powerful. Their flesh appear clear. It doesn’t look like they had utilized medicinal pills to increase their cultivation bases. Tower, could this be due to some special constitution?” Chen Feng secretly asked Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Spirit Constitution. They are practically born for the sake of sword cultivation. They can comprehend sword intent the moment they are born. For them, one year’s worth of cultivation is the equivalent of ten or more years for other sword cultivators,” Tower said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They can comprehend sword intent the moment they are born? Isn’t that a little too outrageous? How does it compare with Jian Xiaotian’s Absolute Combat Constitution?” Chen Feng asked after a moment’s consideration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! Truth be told, constitution is only one aspect. The more important aspect would be how much effort one pours into their cultivation practice and the chances they come across. The Absolute Combat Constitution can be considered to be something at the lowest rung amongst all the special constitutions. However, if he can activate all the profundity contained within the constitution, he will be able to soar and the constitution will become a top-tier constitution. However, activating all the profundity contained within the Absolute Combat Constitution is something that only one in a hundred could accomplish. Clearly, Jian Xiaotian is far from achieving that. I would suggest he stop with his sword cultivation and instead walk the body cultivation route. Tempering his fleshly body is the best development route for him,” Tower said slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean that the twin sisters here are more talented than Jian Xiaotian?” Chen Feng asked again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Isn’t that obvious?” Tower replied, pursing his lips to the side. It was as though he was looking at a buffoon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The twin sisters are astonishingly talented and they possess high cultivation bases. Additionally, their ability to complement each other while fighting makes it look like they are in fact, one person. Even so, unless a miracle happens, they will be lose today.” The situation unfolding before him was as clear as day. There was no need for Chen Feng to utilize his eye technique to see that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Aren’t you that miracle?” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Zhan Qingsong’s mount is quite good,” Chen Feng did not answer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A variant-type one-horned beast. Peak-level Great Yao. It also contains the blood of a Yao King. Naturally, it is good.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe I should snatch it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The 20 cultivators attacked and the pressure on Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling doubled. The sword light around them began shrinking. It would appear that they were about to be defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even their mounts, the one-horned beasts, were attacking the twins. Their horns shone with light to fire out one concentrated energy beam after another. The energy beams searched around for any weak points and attacked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Should I make my move now?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng hesitated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The corner of Jian Qingwu’s sleeve was torn and her movements were disrupted. Seeing that, Zhan Qingsong laughed smugly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Little beauties, stop resisting. Just come in quietly.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a death wish!” The two sisters uttered a tender shout each as they attempted to break through, wanting to capture Zhan Qingsong. However, their several attempts ended in failure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Time to take action. Eh, wait! There is someone here!</span></em><span>&nbsp;As Chen Feng was planning on taking action, his pupils suddenly contracted. His pupils spun and he carefully inspected his surroundings. Soon enough, he found someone hiding up in the sky. This person’s cultivation base was very high and Chen Feng was only barely able to sense him. He could not make out the details of this hidden person.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This fellow should be on Zhan Qingsong’s side. However, it seems he is waiting for someone.</span></em><span>&nbsp;The peculiar thought rose to Chen Feng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heh! He really was waiting for someone!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng smiled. A blue light rapidly appeared up in the sky. A human figure could be seen within the flashing blue light. However, it was not possible to see the specific details of the figure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The blue light rapidly descended only to land gracefully on the ground. Despite that, the cultivators who were besieging Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling were sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What an exquisite lightning technique!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was surprised. This newcomer’s ability to control lightning had reached perfection. By channelling his eye technique, Chen Feng was able to see through the blue ball of lightning. The figure inside it was actually a gentle-looking female cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Is this female cultivator also a disciple from Heavenly Sword Faction? However, I believe that the fellow hiding up in the sky will be showing up soon</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, after the female cultivator appeared, a faint-dark figure appeared up in the sky to swiftly descend to the ground. The unparalleled aura of savagery that this figure was radiating caused the expressions of all the cultivators present to change.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The blue ball of lightning dissipated and an average-looking female cultivator appeared before the eyes of all present. Her beautiful hair billowed about while lightning crackled in the air, stopping the incoming atmosphere of suppression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Impressive! The two of them are half-step Human Immortals. Additionally, they are so young.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng nearly blurted out. However, a passionate look could be seen on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lan Ling, I have been waiting for you. You are finally here. You did not disappoint.” A young, tall and mighty cultivator with chiselled features landed on the ground. However, when he looked at the average-looking female cultivator, a fiery desire for combat flashed across his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Young Master Tianhen, are you provoking me here?” Even Lan Ling’s voice was very ordinary. It was as though she was a mortal with zero cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You can consider this as a provocation. I have heard that you have a title in Absolute Academy, the Number One beneath Human Immortals. I have long since wanted to experience your skills. I hope you will not disappoint me today,” Young Master Tianhen stared intently at Lan Ling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have long since heard of Young Master Tianhen’s name. You went through so much effort just because you want to exchange pointers with me?” Lan Ling said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right! Make your move!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The aura emanating from Young Master Tianhen’s body became even more savage. The surrounding energy streams surged and he became like an ancient savage beast. His focused eyes shone ceaselessly and sizzling sounds could be heard coming from them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lightning bolts erupted from Lan Ling’s body, the aura radiating from her body in no way inferior compared to Young Master Tianhen’s aura. Rather, it was even more tyrannical. Bolts of lightning flashed and the sky turned dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them rushed forward to instantly clash against one another. It was as though two human-shaped monsters were tearing at each other, raging across the lands. Everywhere they went, their surroundings would be turned to ash. Not only were Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling forced to back away, even Chen Feng ended up gaping at their fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Truly formidable! Although the two of them are only half-step Human Immortals, they are already infinitely close to reaching the Human Immortal stage. They would not lose against the average Human Immortal.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s eyes had turned dark and he observed the two with unblinking eyes. He was swiftly analysing their strengths.</span></p>
