 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s nothing. Just a minor conflict. Looks like we can’t stay here anymore. We’ll return to our room,” Chen Feng said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Drink some tea before you leave.” Ling Long moved forward with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No need. I thank Miss Ling Long for your kindness, but I prefer wine.” Chen Feng refused.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he, little brothers. This is no ordinary tea. It can fortify the soul and ease the heart. You two have only just gotten into a fight. That makes this an even more suitable time to drink this tea. Besides, I have brought this over especially for you two. Would you have the heart to refuse?” Ling Long said, winking at Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well. In that case, we thank Miss Ling Long for this act of kindness,” Chen Feng said, raising up the tea bowl before gulping down all of its contents in one go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The bluish-green tea flowed into his body and Chen Feng instantly sensed a refreshing feeling spreading throughout his body. All the pores on his body opened up and strands of cold air were ejected out from the pores. It gave Chen Feng a pleasant sensation and his spirits lifted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It really is a good tea.” Chen Feng could not stop himself from giving it praise. It was his heartfelt words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng drink the tea, a look of smugness flashed deep within Ling Long’s eyes. However, it was well concealed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Nine Firmaments Palace’s Young Master Lei, your turn,” Ling Long said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t like tea,” Jian Xiaotian said nonchalantly before walking away. He did not even bother waiting for Ling Long’s response.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! This brother of mine has a temper. Miss Ling Long, please do not feel offended. I will drink this bowl of tea. As it so happens, I am feeling a little thirsty,” said Chen Feng, who gulped down the other bowl.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It really is good tea. Thank you, Miss Ling Long. Goodbye.” After saying that, Chen Feng cupped his fists towards her and left the lobby.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Humph! One bowl of my Soul Bewildering Tea is worth more than 10,000 Prized crystals. You got yourself a bargain there. Next up, however, you will have to cough up everything on you to compensate my loss.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Observing Chen Feng’s departure, Ling Long secretly sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Ling Long waved her hand and all the broken furniture in the lobby disappeared. After that, the disappeared furniture were replaced with brand new tables and chairs. Only after having done that did Ling Long leave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those two fellows are truly not to be underestimated. Truly detestable. They dare act so arrogantly in our ship? I almost couldn’t stop myself from giving them a lesson,” the bald muscleman said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! What do you know? Such recklessness. Did you not see that the sword Chen Feng brought out just now is a Sacred artefact? Additionally, it is of a higher grade compared to our Skysoar Warship. By unleashing its full power, he can even cut our ship into two,” the insidious-looking middle-aged man said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Boss, no need to worry. They have already fallen prey to my Hidden Soul Fragrance. Additionally, he has also taken my Soul Bewildering Tea earlier. Once the medicinal power of the tea comes into effect, only a cultivation base at the Human Immortal stage can allow him to avoid dying under our hands,” Ling Long said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He can casually bring out a Sacred artefact. This proves that the two of them have a considerable number of good items on them. Naturally, they will also be difficult to handle. We will need to be cautious,” the middle-aged scholar said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. Once we reach the Starsea Region, we’ll be in our territory. Do we still need to fear them turning the tables on us?” the bald muscleman said, gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After returning to the room, Chen Feng instantly set up a layer of barrier around them. Next, he sat down cross-legged to circulate his technique. He wanted to force out the poison within the tea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After some time had passed, Chen Feng furrowed his brows. Earlier, he had circulated his primary energy, but had failed to detect any poison hiding within his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Strange. Is there no poison inside the tea? I don’t believe that woman would be so kind,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He mobilized all of his soul power and his longevity-type primary energy circulated even faster. Finally, the Soul and Anima acupoints and his sea of wisdom abruptly gave a slight shake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng finally managed to find the poison. It was very subtle and had almost become one with his primary energy. Given Chen Feng’s present soul power and scanning ability, he had almost failed to detect it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I wonder what kind of poison this is. It could actually affect the soul directly. If I am not mistaken, once this poison takes effect, my sea of wisdom would be corroded by this poison!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After finding the poison, Chen Feng no longer felt worried. He began circulating his longevity-type primary energy to refine the poison. Unexpectedly, he had to spend nearly two hours before fully refining all the poison within him. All of them were transformed into spiritual energy and devoured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>He he! A poison of such high grade must surely be expensive. Too bad, you fellows are going to be disappointed.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng secretly snickered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He waved his hand to once again bring out the wine gourd and continued drinking wine with Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, Brother Jian. Let’s continue. We don’t know what will happen next. It will be better for us to increase our strength a little.” Chen Feng would spend some time refining the wine after every sip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I can’t drink anymore. This wine is too strong. I will need to refine it properly.” At that moment, Jian Xiaotian’s whole body was red in colour. It was as though he was suffering from a high fever. As the wine’s medicinal power continued to spread out, smoke began rising from Jian Xiaotian’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There was still more than half of the wine left in the gourd. As Chen Feng’s fleshly body was much stronger compared to Jian Xiaotian’s fleshly body, he was still far from his limits. Thus, Chen Feng picked up the wine gourd and directly drank the wine from the gourd.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He gulped down one kilogramme’s worth of wine in one go. Finally, Chen Feng could not hold on anymore. The fiery medicinal power within his body clashed continuously, seemingly desirous of burning up his internal organs. Chen Feng opened his mouth and flaming sparks actually flew out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Remarkable! This wine is truly powerful!” Chen Feng knew that he had reached his limit. He kept the wine gourd and began focusing his all to refine the medicinal powers inside his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The countless strands of medicinal powers became like a tempest of spiritual energy, churning chaotically within Chen Feng’s body. However, with one circulation of his longevity-type primary energy, one strand after another was refined and transformed into surging streams of primary energy, which flowed through his meridians. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Fiery streams of energy were transformed into cool streams of energy, which surged into his sea of wisdom. Immediately, Chen Feng could feel his soul power growing slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The money spent on this wine was not a waste. It could actually improve the soul power.” Chen Feng was slightly shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It took the two of them one whole day’s worth of cultivation to fully refine the medicinal powers inside their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible! I have gained 10 years’ worth of cultivation from that. How outrageous!” Jian Xiaotian blurted out in both shock and joy. With a flick of his fingers, he sent several motes of sword light out, which then flew about around him. Clearly, Jian Xiaotian had gained a breakthrough in his cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I gained 30 years’ worth of cultivation from that. Right now, I wonder if the auction house was in the dark about this wine’s true value,” Chen Feng said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the improvement in Chen Feng’s cultivation base, his corresponding insight acupoints for level 9 of the Concealed stage began shaking slightly. It felt as though they might open up at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Amongst the insight acupoints for level 9 of the Concealed stage, I have already opened up the Life, Death, Soul and Anima acupoints. There are still the Yin, Yang, Void, Actual and Return acupoints. However, I can sense that it won’t be long before all of them are open and I will be able to rise up to the Sky Human stage. Hopefully, I will be able to overcome Lightning Tribulation when I reach the Central Plains,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng considered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, the Starsea Region lies just ahead.” Suddenly, Ling Long’s voice spread throughout the Skysoar Warship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A transparent window suddenly appeared on the wall of Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian’s room. It allowed them to clearly observe what was happening outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was clear that the Skysoar Warship was descending. It moved through layer after layer of strong winds and clouds and it did not take long before they caught sight of mountains, rivers and forests.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like the name of the Heavenly Origin Trade Association is still very useful. We have flown through 100,000 kilometres. Surprisingly, it has been an uneventful journey. We did not even encounter a single bandit along the way,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a Sacred artefact. The average bandit would surely not take action against it. However, the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace did not appear. This is surprising,” Chen Feng said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lakes of varying sizes appeared before their eyes. The lakes there appeared slightly different compared to the lakes in other places. Its waters were clearer and purer. When the lakes appeared before their eyes, the spiritual energy in the air, too, became thicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ve entered the Starsea Region. I have heard that the lakes here were created by falling meteors,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. The power of stars here is very strong. There are also a high number of star fragments scattered around the Starsea Region. Many cultivators would come here to find meteor iron to forge weapons and armours. A long time has passed since then and the number of meteor iron is gradually decreasing. However, the number of cultivators keeps increasing,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, we can get some harvest here as well.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We will definitely get some harvest here. This place can be considered a land of chaos. Bandits reign about here and there. Although this is Star Assembly Sect’s territory, even the disciples from Star Assembly Sect would have to exercise caution when venturing into this place.” Although Jian Xiaotian was from the Central Plains, he knew more about the Northern Plains compared to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder when they will take action. Let me check again.” After saying that, Chen Feng spread out his soul power again. It did not take long for it to envelop the entire Skysoar Warship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellows, please hold!” Suddenly, tens of cultivators appeared to block the Skysoar Warship’s flight path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Something is happening!” Chen Feng’s heart gave a thump.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it the guys from Nine Firmaments Palace?” Jian Xiaotian whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Most likely. Let’s observe and see how they plan on dealing with this situation,” Chen Feng whispered back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Skysoar Warship slowed down. However, it did not stop. The insidious-looking man’s voice rang out. “Who are you fellows and why are you blocking the way? Can you not see that this Skysoar Warship belongs to Heavenly Origin Trade Association?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it is a Skysoar Warship from Heavenly Origin Trade Association. We are cultivators from Star Assembly Sect and Nine Firmaments Palace, here to arrest some criminals. I hope that you can accommodate our request,” a middle-aged cultivator said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! You fellows want to arrest criminals? Surely, you are not thinking of searching through the Skysoar Warship of Heavenly Origin Trade Association, are you? Even if the elders from your sects are here, I believe that they still do not have the right to do so!” The insidious-looking man’s voice was hard and the Skysoar Warship continued flying forward, only stopping right before the obstructing cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A stream of light flew out from the Skysoar Warship to land in the hand of the middle-aged cultivator who had spoken up earlier. It was a token.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it’s Manager He from Heavenly Origin Trade Association. We are being disrespectful,” the middle-aged cultivator said, waving his hand to return the token.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Can we go now?” The insidious-looking man, Manager He, said with a scoff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Err, as it is very important that we arrest those criminals, I ask for your cooperation,” the middle-aged cultivator said again. He refused to let them go.</span></p>
