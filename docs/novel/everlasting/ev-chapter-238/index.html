<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Chen Feng had unravelled the invading soul power, he wasn’t exactly in great shape. Due to the force from the Soulblade’s attack, Chen Feng’s body flew into the sky once more. A bone-revealing wound appeared on his chest and blood gushed out uncontrollably from the wound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! Kid, get over here!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng getting terribly injured, Xu Ziping grew overjoyed. He could no longer hold himself back. With a leap, he arrived before Chen Feng and grasped at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, the space in front of Chen Feng rippled outwards and a silvery-white, dragon-like talon emerged from the ripple. It caught Xu Ziping and furiously tugged, bringing him with it as it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A living human had disappeared while having the advantageous position. The incredible difference in the situation caused Liu Tian to quickly halt his attack. Cautiously, he put some distance between himself and Chen Feng as he cast a grim look at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What was that?” Liu Tian asked in shock. There was a slight tone of fear in his voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You want to know? Just come over and find out.” By then, Chen Feng had already stabilized himself. His fingers moved and fine strands of silk swiftly stitched up his wound. His longevity-type primary energy quickly circulated and the blood coming out from the wound swiftly coagulated, revealing his formidable healing ability.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Tian pondered. Due to what happened earlier, Liu Tian dared not casually attack again. That spectacle was too peculiar. Before figuring out what that was, Liu Tian would not risk his life.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, a stalemate was reached. Liu Tian did not attack while Chen Feng was in no hurry as he began healing his wounds in a carefree manner. Seeing the carefree demeanour that Chen Feng was exhibiting, Liu Tian grew more fearful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Time ticked by. Finally, Liu Tian turned to look at Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun. He then gritted his teeth, turned around and left. He did not utter a single word.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Liu Tian’s figure disappear from sight, Chen Feng finally breathed a sigh of relief. Slowly, he sat down cross-legged and sent his divine sense into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Inside the Longevity Tower, Xu Ziping was lying on the ground. A large wyrm’s talon pressed down on his body and he looked miserable to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, it was none other than the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm. If it were not for the fact that Purplebolt had not fully recovered, he would have flown out and started a rampage earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The soul power Chen Feng sent in kept wriggling and it did not take long for it to assume Chen Feng’s shape. Originally, Chen Feng should not have been capable of this feat with his present level of cultivation. Thanks to the Longevity Tower, however, he was capable of performing the feat in advance. Naturally, that was limited to within the Longevity Tower. In the outside world, even if Chen Feng’s soul power was ten times stronger, he would be incapable of condensing it to assume his form.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You! What is this?” Xu Ziping, who was lying on the floor, shouted out fearfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the Lightstream Shield in Xu Ziping’s hand flew over before falling into Chen Feng’s grasp. After inspecting it, Chen Feng smiled and said, “Just a grade 1 Prized artefact. Isn’t it a little low?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing Chen Feng’s words, Xu Ziping nearly puked out blood. <em>Do you think Prized artefacts are cabbages that are available everywhere? If not for the fact that I have some standing in the Xu Family, I wouldn’t even have this Prized artefact.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a swing of his hand, Chen Feng tossed the Prized artefact aside. Next, with a wave of his hand, the storage bracelet on Xu Ziping’s hand flew up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good item! What a good item! This is my first time seeing a storage-type magic treasure of this grade,” said Chen Feng smilingly as he regarded the bracelet in his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!” Xu Ziping’s face had turned red. However, he could not break free. He felt like a fish on the chopping board. He could only lie down and allow the other party to chop him up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry up and release me! Our Central Plains’ Xu Family is not something you can afford to offend!” Xu Ziping threatened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, I don’t care who you are or what your background is. You attacked me today. You can forget about getting out alive,” Chen Feng said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You want to kill me?” Xu Ziping grew even more terrified.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng cast one icy glance at Xu Ziping before ignoring him. Instead, he turned towards Purplebolt. “How is your recovery coming along?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Half. Give me a little more time and I will be able to recover completely,” Purplebolt said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine. Your yao kind eats humans, right? I’ll let you handle this fellow.” After saying that, Chen Feng left the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t leave! Let me out! Don’t kill me!” Xu Ziping quickly shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng ignored him. Since he had chosen to attack Chen Feng, he cannot complain about getting killed after losing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, no one else came to disturb them. Chen Feng happily focused on healing and cultivating himself. One day later, Chen Feng’s wounds were fully healed. He even managed to refine a portion of the yao essence power within his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Not long after that, Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun came to, one after another. By then, they had fully recovered their strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thank you, Brother Chen, for protecting us,” Tie Changkong said gratefully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When you two were healing, Liu Tian and Xu Ziping attacked.” Chen Feng informed them what happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Liu Tian actually chose to attack?” Tie Changkong said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If we survive, our Flowing Cloud Hall will not let him go,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If we ever meet him again, just finish him off,” Chen Feng said smilingly. Liu Tian was now in Chen Feng’s to-kill list.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Now that we have recovered, should we return to the mountain with spiritual herbs?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, that is my plan as well. The number of spiritual herbs that are over 1,000 years old there is innumerable. Besides, we had only gone halfway up. If we keep going up, we might find herbs that are over 10,000 years old. Even if we only acquire one such herb, rising to the Sky Human stage would not be an issue.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t dawdle anymore. Let’s head out now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng and the others were quickly disappointed. They quickly discovered that they were mistaken. When they finally returned to the mountain, what greeted them was another landscape entirely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I remember the mountain should be here. How did it become a flat plain?” Chen Feng blurted as he observed the flat terrain laid out before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Did we go the wrong way?” Shangguan Yun asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There shouldn’t be any mistake about it. It is here,” Tie Changkong said with a frown.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are inside the immortal mountain. It is no ordinary place. We might have entered some other pocket dimension,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since we cannot find it, there is no need to force the issue. Let’s just head to some other place.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite saying that, they felt terribly disappointed. There were, after all, so many spiritual herbs there. It was something that some people could never encounter throughout their entire lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! What a pity!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even though it had been a few days since then, Chen Feng and the others would still lament when they recall the mountain matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“First there was an endless forest. Now, there is an endless plain. Having a few Great Yaos pop out is better. Sigh, could these be the only places within the immortal mountain? Without the higher concentration of spiritual energy here, I think those cultivators who entered this place would end up going crazy from boredom,” said Tie Changkong as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe it is because our cultivation base is not high enough. If we possess a top-grade flying Prized artefact that is capable of travelling 50,000 kilometres per day, we will surely not feel bored when travelling using that artefact,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I think we should find a place to cultivate for a while. Compared to my sect, this place is more suitable for cultivation,” Shangguan Yun suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right, I have no objections. After spending the past few days travelling forward, I feel a bit bored.” Tie Changkong agreed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have no objections as well. However, the sunlight here is too strong. It would be better if we can find a small forest. I am now missing that large forest. At least it was filled with vitality and grass essence,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, they continued flying for another two days, flying through over 5,000 kilometres. And yet, the same flat plains laid out before them. They did not encounter any other cultivators, nor did they see any other landscapes. However, they did find a small oasis.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, it cannot even be considered an oasis. It was too small. It was just a small spot with grasses growing upon it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! I feel like I have become an ordinary human within a vast and endless desert,” Tie Changkong said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This place is not bad. The spiritual energy here is exuberant and the ground is very soft.” Chen Feng smiled as he plopped his buttocks onto the verdant grasses.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. It is a good place for cultivation. At any rate, we don’t have anywhere to go to. We might as well cultivate here for a while. I feel like I am going to break through soon,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I also feel on the verge of breaking through,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The rate of cultivation inside is indeed much faster compared to the outside world,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were only flat plains surrounding them and their gazes revealed nothing else. Even so, the three of them had chosen to be careful and set up some restrictive barriers before beginning their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Watching Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun quickly entering a state of cultivation, Chen Feng spontaneously smiled. Next, he lay down with his face heading upwards. It looked as though he was resting with his eyes closed, but he was in fact comprehending the Longevity Scripture over and over again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Scripture was extensively profound. The amount that Chen Feng had currently cultivated was but a smidge of a fur from the scripture. Chen Feng felt that he had recently been focused more on cultivating his fleshly body while his cultivation of the Longevity Scripture had slowed down somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At any rate, his rate of improvement was very fast. Additionally, he felt he had plenty of time. As he was feeling unhurried, Chen Feng decided to allocate some time to properly comprehend some of the profound secret techniques within the Longevity Scripture.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the most important technique was the weapon condensation technique. What Chen Feng wanted most at that moment was to refine his Longevity Furnace to the point where he can concoct pills with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His Longevity Furnace had been infused with the longevity true spirit last time and thus possessed actual form, patterns and mysterious laws. However, there were still some ways to go before it could truly be used to concoct pills.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knew that this was not something he could rush. He could only take it one step at a time and slowly figure it out. Slowly, he would improve his strength and gradually grasp the weapon condensation and pill concoction technique.</span></p>
