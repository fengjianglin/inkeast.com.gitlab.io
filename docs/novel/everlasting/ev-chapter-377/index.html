 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian’s attacks, the muscular cultivator extended a palm and slapped his massive hammer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An even greater soundwave spread out from the hammer before splitting into two soundwaves, one charging towards Jian Xiaotian while the other charged towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bo! Bo!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian broke the attacks aimed at them. However, doing so affected their forward momentum.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, the muscular cultivator simply had the massive hammer hover before him while he slapped both palms against the surface of the hammer. Two shockwaves, even stronger than the previous ones, rippled towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The astral shields on Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian’s bodies were blown away as a result. That was especially true of Jian Xiaotian, who did not possess a high-grade body armour like Chen Feng. The shockwave tore Jian Xiaotian’s clothes apart to reveal his sturdy body. His hair was thrown back and his figure fell behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This fellow is very strong.” Sword energy swirled around Jian Xiaotian’s body to cleave the shockwave apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are the Hammer Lord, Lei Zhentian!” Chen Feng abruptly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, I am none other than Lei Zhentian. You are Chen Feng and you are Jian Xiaotian. You are unfortunate to bump into me. If you do not want to die, just be obedient and follow me,” Lei Zhentian said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“With your strength alone? You don’t have what it takes!” The will to fight surged out from Jian Xiaotian’s body and he once again entered the unity of man and sword state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Absolute Combat Constitution!” Lei Zhentian’s eyes glinted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whether or not I have the ability, you will know soon enough.” After saying that, Lei Zhentian took one step forward, bringing himself tens of metres forward to arrive before Jian Xiaotian. With a swing, his massive hammer smashed towards Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bring it!” Jian Xiaotian did not dodge. Instead, he swung his own great sword at the incoming hammer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!” Sensing Lei Zhentian’s aura, Chen Feng knew that Jian Xiaotian would be incapable of taking the attack. Thus, he unleashed an attack at Lei Zhentian as fast as he could. The lance in his hand stabbed at Lei Zhentian. Chen Feng had wanted to use this attack to make it so that Lei Zhentian would hesitate in exerting his full power against Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, Lei Zhentian did not react to Chen Feng’s attack at all. His hammer continued smashing forward to send Jian Xiaotian flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian had already unleashed his full power for the attack. Unexpectedly, the collision felt to him as though a mountain had slammed against him. Next, his whole body flinched and flew uncontrollably backwards. As his figure was still hurtling through the sky, Jian Xiaotian could feel blood trickling out from his pores.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Incredible! He nearly smashed me to death!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Jian Xiaotian thought. Next, his figure smashed heavily into the mountain, disappearing from sight. The only thing left there was a large hole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s lance struck Lei Zhentian’s body. This attack from Chen Feng could pierce through a mountain. However, it only caused Lei Zhentian to stagger slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!” Lei Zhentian gave a grunt. Clearly, taking the attack was not an easy feat for him. Next, he swung his massive hammer at Chen Feng once more to release another pulse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt as though a volcano was erupting in his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Domain, water and fire!” Chen Feng shouted out in a hushed tone. Next, his domain rapidly unfurled. At the same time, the power of ice and fire within his body armour were activated and they surged forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lei Zhentian’s attack slammed against Chen Feng heavily and his figure flew backwards rapidly. However, Chen Feng’s state was not as wretched as Jian Xiaotian. After falling for just over 100 metres, Chen Feng had managed to steady himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unlike what had happened earlier, Lei Zhentian was having a relatively harder time with Chen Feng’s move. His body staggered as he retreated tens of metres backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is this possible? You are just a minor cultivator in the Concealed stage. How could you block my Skyquake Hammer?” Lei Zhentian uttered out in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This fellow is truly formidable. Looks like we will be bogged down</span></em><span>. Chen Feng knew that their fight would surely attract the attention of the other cultivators. Thus, he quickly brought out the Demon Sealing Sword. At the same time, he released his domain once more and charged towards Lei Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact!” Lei Zhentian’s eyes lit up. He then waved his hand and the massive hammer shrunk until it was the size of a human.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After shrinking down, however, the oddly-shaped Skyquake Hammer grew even more terrifying. Bolts of lightning kept flashing on the surface of the hammer. Shockingly, Lei Zhentian then used the hammer to take Chen Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword head on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After two clashes, bolts of lightning began flashing across Lei Zhentian’s body as well. At the same time, the will to fight radiating from his body rose sharply.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. This is the Thunderous Combat Constitution.” Tower, who had remained silent all this time, suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like this world is quite mysterious. It hasn’t been too long, but I have already encountered so many spiritual roots,” Tower continued, sounding somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“To think that it would be the Thunderous Combat Constitution.” Jian Xiaotian flew towards them, his face covered in dust. Despite his wretched appearance, his will to fight had not weakened in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Your Absolute Combat Constitution is not bad either. However, your cultivation base is too low. You are no match for me,” Lei Zhentian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll have to put that to the test!” Jian Xiaotian’s will to fight soared. Despite knowing that he was no match for Lei Zhentian, he revealed no hint of fear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to quickly end the fight, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian unleashed every drop of strength they possessed. That was especially true of Chen Feng, who had mobilized the power of the Demon Sealing Sword right from the start. He could feel the alarming rate at which his primary energy was falling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They fought from high up in the sky all the way down to the ground. Due to the ferocious attacks that they were unleashing, the thick trees within the forest were broken, some uprooted completely as a result. Occasionally, deep craters would appear all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The longer the fight went one, the more shocked Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian felt. They did not expect this Lei Zhentian, who possessed a certain level of fame within the world of cultivation, to be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, their fight attracted the attention of other cultivators. One by one, the pursuers arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian! Great, attack!” Two of the cultivators blindly jumped into the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of them were smashed to smithereens by the Skyquake Hammer while the other one was cleaved into two by Chen Feng’s Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These two are mine. Anyone who interferes will be making an enemy of me, Lei Zhentian!” Lei Zhentian said loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? It’s Lei Zhentian! Not good. Looks like we cannot get a piece of this pie anymore!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! What is there to be afraid of? No matter how powerful Lei Zhentian may be, he is still just one man. Everyone, swarm forward! Kill Chen Feng first. After that, we’ll go to Nine Firmaments Palace together and collect the rewards!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every single one of them was there for the rewards. Thus, with just a minor prodding from one of the cultivators, the other cultivators who had been feeling scrupulous about attacking began clamouring as well. Forgetting all about the two cultivators who had just been killed, ten plus cultivators charged into the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You really are courting death!” Lei Zhentian was thoroughly enraged. Seeing the cultivators ignore him instantly caused an unrestrained killing intent to rise up from his heart. He stopped fighting against Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian and instead swung his Skyquake Hammer at the incoming cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, one of the cultivators was smashed into pieces by the Skyquake Hammer. Every time Lei Zhentian swung his hammer, one cultivator would die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only after four cultivators were killed in quick succession did the cultivators remember that Lei Zhentian was like a God of Slaughter that was not to be trifled with. Thus, they quickly backed away. Witnessing Lei Zhentian’s ruthless actions deterred them all. However, more cultivators suddenly arrived. These cultivators swiftly encircled Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian the moment they saw them, completely ignoring Lei Zhentian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad. There are so many cultivators,” Jian Xiaotian said, frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Screw it! Take advantage of the chaos and run,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng had only just uttered those words when another ten plus cultivators rushed forward to encircle them. Many of them were utilizing flying swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How troublesome.” Chen Feng swiftly waved his hand and two incoming flying swords were cut into two each by the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, we’ll just have to kill them all!” Jian Xiaotian charged into the crowd and displayed his Skywheel Shattersword move, immediately killing two cultivators. However, the other cultivators seemed unafraid of death as they swarmed forward to engulf Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The situation grew even more chaotic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We cannot stop here. Hurry, charge out!” Chen Feng said as he unleashed two tangible bolts of astral lightning from the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand to kill off four cultivators in a row.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng kill off four cultivators in a flash, the other cultivators were shocked. Immediately, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian made use of that opening to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t let them escape!” A series of staff silhouettes swung down at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng responded with a swing of his hand and the opponent was hacked into two, his staff as well. However, two more attacks landed on Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two flying swords struck Chen Feng’s back, one from the left and one from the right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Got it! I killed Chen Feng!” a young cultivator whooped with joy and surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My attack landed first! I killed Chen Feng!” another cultivator shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Morons!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng uttered in a hushed tone. With a wave of his hand, he caught the two flying swords. Next, with a flick of his palm, two chilling beams of light shot forward and the two cultivators instantly cried out miserably as they fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows have not even overcome Lightning Tribulation, and yet you chose to walk to your deaths,” Chen Feng said with a scoff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian fought side by side as they killed a way out. This time, although there were many cultivators, not a single one of the newcomers was an expert. After a bunch of them were killed off, the remaining cultivators quickly scattered in panic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry, run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After struggling to scatter the cultivators, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian flew forward. However, they had yet to even cover a distance of one kilometre when Lei Zhentian caught up to them and entangled them in a fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lei Zhentian, you are someone with quite the reputation in the world of cultivation. Why must you become one of Nine Firmaments Palace’s lapdogs?” Chen Feng could not stop himself from swearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This Lei Zhentian was too hard to deal with. He possessed a high cultivation base and level. Additionally, he also possessed the Thunderous Combat Constitution, giving him an innate talent for combat. The Skyquake Hammer in his hand was also a decent Sacred artefact. Chen Feng believed that he could not defeat Lei Zhentian without first overcoming his Lightning Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nonsense! You are Nine Firmaments Palace’s lapdog!” Lei Zhentian grew furious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If you are not, why are you chasing after us?” Chen Feng said, the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand colliding against the Skyquake Hammer once more. The powerful rebound forced the two of them to back away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nonsense! I am obviously doing this for the rewards,” Lei Zhentian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well. In that case, I can also give you what you want,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“For real?” Lei Zhentian froze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course, provided you help us kill off some pursuers,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! This time, due to Nine Firmaments Palace’s offer, countless cultivators have come forward to kill you fellows. Given a choice between facing you fellows and facing the countless pursuers, which choice do you think I will make?” Lei Zhentian laughed.</span></p>
