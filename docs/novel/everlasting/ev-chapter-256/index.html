 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>On its way back, it had already killed off several cultivators who dared provoke it. At that very moment, however, one cultivator had fearlessly approached it. He was even using poisonous smoke to attack it while blowing up its grotto-residence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was a lofty Great Yao that had overcome 8 Lightning Tribulations. In the future, it would rise further to the Yao King stage. How could it allow a minor human cultivator to step upon its head?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm flew into a fit of rage. It wanted to devour the cultivator outside before returning to recover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An intense heat wave sprayed out from the hole, causing the rocks outside to melt. Seeing that, Chen Feng quickly backed away. The high temperature was something that not even Chen Feng could handle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful, it is coming out,” Tower reminded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Say, Tower. Why don’t we just put the Longevity Tower atop the hole and suck the Great Yao in? Wouldn’t that be easier?” Chen Feng suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is not that simple. If that move fails, this little snake will run away. Where will you go to find such a good opportunity in the future? Besides, this is also a good opportunity to train yourself,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a flash, a massive wyrm appeared before Chen Feng. Intense flames burned around its large head. Those were the earthen fire that it had yet to refine.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A Concealed stage cultivator?” When the Great Yao saw Chen Feng, it grew shocked. However, it quickly recognized Chen Feng as the one who could easily dissipate its essence flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The instant the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm appeared, Chen Feng made his move. A blood-coloured beam of light swiftly and forcefully struck the Great Yao’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was surprised to see that his move managed to land. Unexpectedly, the Great Yao had remained still, allowing him to land a hit on it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A light ringing sound could be heard as Chen Feng’s attack succeeded in creating nothing more than a small burst of sparks. It had failed to even leave a shallow mark upon the surface of its body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only then did Chen Feng realize why the Great Yao had chosen to not dodge. Despite its wounds, its mighty body was not something that ordinary cultivators could handle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The attack with Bloody Soul earlier was already Chen Feng’s strongest attack. However, he had failed to break even its defence. How was he supposed to continue this fight?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm rushed forward to abruptly arrive before Chen Feng. Next, it opened its mouth to swallow Chen Feng in. The Great Yao no longer wanted to burn him to ash. At that moment, it desired to eat up this human who had dared provoke it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The overpowering pressure and aura were such that Chen Feng felt himself suffocating. Not to mention, the large mouth and sharp fangs had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Back away! That was the only thing he could do.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Chen Feng darted backwards, the layers of restrictive magic arrays he set up activated. At the same time, a high number of chains and ropes shot out to wrap around the Great Yao that was in the midst of them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a death wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the human cultivator utilize the methods for capturing yao beasts against it, the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm grew even more enraged. A miniscule ant dared to infringe upon its dignity? Death was too good for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of booming sounds rang out as the restrictive magic arrays that Chen Feng set up began blowing up. The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm was relying solely on its overpowering might to smash through them all. One charge had successfully destroyed one tenth of the surrounding magic arrays.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Huh! Thank goodness! It seems this Great Yao really is badly wounded, otherwise it would have been capable of destroying all the magic arrays I set up with one charge.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng gave a sigh of relief. Next, his hands flashed forward as he formed several hand seals and unleashed one magic technique after another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every one of the surrounding restrictive magic arrays unleashed an explosive power. Their target, the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm that was trapped in the middle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The surrounding restrictive magic arrays exploded continuously and the chaotic powers smashed into the surrounding stone pillars, breaking them into fragments. In the face of the formidable shockwaves, Chen Feng maintained his position as he continued launching attack after attack without respite.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After just a few charges from the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm, half of the surrounding restrictive magic arrays had been blown up. The spirit stones Chen Feng embedded into the ground were also exploding, adding to the chaos there. Chen Feng however, found it increasingly harder to hold on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Keep at it! This fellow doesn’t have much power left. Keep using the magic arrays to sap away its strength!” Tower kept encouraging Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m doing my best here!” Chen Feng was already forcing out every last drop of his power. Both his hands were moving as fast as they possibly could to ceaselessly send out streams of magic techniques. The amount of primary energy within his body was quickly dropping. Thankfully, Chen Feng had opened up some insight acupoints. The vast amount of power he had accumulated inside them surged out, replenishing Chen Feng’s drained reserve. The energy stored within the Wood acupoint was especially outrageous. If Chen Feng had allowed all that energy to burst out, he would have found it impossible to control.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had taken out practically every one of the restrictive magic arrays, chains, ropes and nets he accumulated inside the Longevity Tower in order to deal with this Great Yao. He had truly invested a great deal into this endeavour. Additionally, Chen Feng had also sent out his own Longevity Chains to tie up the Great Yao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Before this, due to the unending flow of primary energy in his body, Chen Feng had believed that it would not be an issue for him to do battle against other cultivators for three days and three nights. At that moment, however, he no longer believed that. The rate at which he was consuming the primary energy within his body had far exceeded his imagination.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Streams of primary energy were flowing out like torrents, causing Chen Feng’s resilient meridians to feel stinging sensations. It meant that the rate at which his primary energy was flowing out was too fast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, did you think that these little tricks are enough to stop me? Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm finally lost patience. A fireball suddenly erupted and all of the surrounding magic arrays were destroyed. Even the chains and ropes were reduced to ash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s Soulflame. It was over a hundred times stronger compared to ordinary flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Purplebolt, how much have you recovered?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am completely recovered. Additionally, my strength has improved as well. If there are some more yao cores from yao beasts that had overcome Lightning Tribulations before, it won’t take long before I can undergo my 2<sup>nd</sup> Lightning Tribulation,” the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm said happily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. Now, come out and fight!” Chen Feng waved his hand and the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm emerged with all its might and glory, right before the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Plop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt’s body instantly smashed down onto the ground and a fearful thought flowed into Chen Feng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a high-level Great Yao! It is way too strong for me!” In the face of the aura radiating off the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm, Purplebolt felt it hard to even open his mouth. Shouting his thoughts to Chen Feng was all he could do.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was the suppressive effect that superiors imposed upon their inferiors amongst the yao race. There was no need to fight. Its aura alone was enough to suppress its inferiors.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bastard! Get up and fight! This fellow is badly injured. It is already on death’s door. As long as we can kill it, we’ll be rich! This is a Great Yao that has overcome 8 Lightning Tribulations!” Chen Feng shouted disapprovingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What, 8 Lightning Tribulations?!” Purplebolt grew even more terrified. He had only overcome 1 Lightning Tribulation. This opponent was too far above him. There was a world of difference in between just one Lightning Tribulation. In this case, the difference was simply too much.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bastard, get up!” Chen Feng bellowed. Having no other choice, Chen Feng had to utilize the suppressive power of his soul. Chen Feng utilized the manipulative power of his Soul Shackle technique and the fear within Purplebolt’s eyes slowly disappeared. Next, with a roar, his massive body charged towards the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A minor yao beast with just 1 Lightning Tribulation under its belt. You are committing suicide.” There were disdain and anger in the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s eyes. A lesser wyrm dared to challenge its authority?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Purplebolt’s body was one notch smaller than the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body, he was at his full strength. While it was true that his level was far inferior compared to his opponent, the severe wounds on the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm were able to offset some of that difference.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two sides engaged in battle. As the battle progressed, Purplebolt’s fears gradually fell and its combat power gradually rose.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was not simply standing by through it all. Instead, he brandished Bloody Soul to stab at the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm as it was busy fighting Purplebolt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This fellow doesn’t even have 10 % of its original strength. Kill it and I will share half of its yao core with you!” Chen Feng’s voice rang out within Purplebolt’s mind. Hearing that, Purplebolt grew even more ferocious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A yao core with 8 Lightning Tribulations! If he could devour it, what level could he reach? He would likely be able to overcome several Lightning Tribulations himself, no? Due to his thirst for power, the final remnants of fear within Purplebolt disappeared. Only one thought remained within him. <em>Kill this wyrm, devour its yao core and blood essence!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Bloody Soul in Chen Feng’s hand kept creating bursts of sparks upon the surface of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body. Although they could not break through its defence, the force transmitted through the lance managed to bring pain to the Great Yao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A minor human had caused it pain? Although those attacks failed to hurt it, it was an act that offended its dignity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I must kill off this human! And this little wyrm!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Intense flames shot out from the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body. In but the blink of an eye, the flames transformed into an assaulting fire wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt uttered a pained cry and hastily ducked away. Black scorch marks had appeared on its silvery white body. Those were all due to the flames from the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt himself suffocating as well. The magic robes he wore had burned down again. His arm muscles cried out in pain, so much so that Chen Feng had to grimace. He was nearly incapable of wielding Bloody Soul.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hu! Hu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Two-headed Icefire Wyrm charged right into Purplebolt. At the same time, it sent out three streams of fire towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Collect the fire!” Chen Feng shouted. He did not possess the ability to stop fire of that level.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower exerted a suction force and the three streams of fire were instantly sucked into the tower. The fire, capable of burning anything outside, became like ordinary fire after entering the Longevity Tower. It appeared completely bereft of any deterring power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt cried out wretchedly. It did not take long for his whole body to become charred and black. In some places, its scales had fallen off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Those flame attacks were not something that Purplebolt could handle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Endure! This fellow is about to croak!” Chen Feng shouted as he attacked the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm once more.</span></p>
