 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is as far as I can go. Looks like I will have no time to break through to level 8 of the Concealed stage.” Chen Feng slowly ended his training and exited the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, did you break through?” Seeing Chen Feng emerge, Lu Ta came forward and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, I am still at level 7 of the Concealed stage,” Chen Feng said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like Brother Chen will be the one with the lowest cultivation base amongst the core disciples.” Lu Ta laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That should be the case. However, I wonder how many core disciples will participate in this time’s Grand Competition,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time’s Grand Competition was held within the core disciples’ zone. A total of 16 mountains were flattened for the competition and 16 spacious valleys were prepared. The valleys were enough for over a million people to come watch the competition.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng and Lu Ta arrived, they split up. Chen Feng went straight to the place for core disciples to sign up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When he went to register, Chen Feng encountered Luo Mingdao as well. Like him, Luo Mingdao was also lining up to sign up for the competition.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, you have come as well.” Luo Mingdao had stopped addressing Chen Feng as junior brother and the way he treated Chen Feng had grown more polite as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Luo. I didn’t think we have so many core disciples,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Again, only cores disciples at level 4 of the Sky Human stage and below may participate in this Grand Competition. Those above level 4 cannot participate. And yet, one glance from Chen Feng revealed several hundred participants amongst the core disciples.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Up to 500 disciples have signed up so far. This time’s competition will be fierce. Experts from various factions have appeared. Looks like I am not destined for any of the rewards,” Luo Mingdao said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So many?” As he was chatting with Luo Mingdao, Chen Feng observed the cultivation states of the core disciples around them. The atmosphere that every one of them was giving off was like that of a steady boulder while the auras they radiated were as unending as great rivers. Some auras were comparable to the bottomless ocean, giving Chen Feng a sense of wariness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>These people are the true elites of the sect! They are also the pillars and future of the sect. I wonder how many peerless geniuses I will get to encounter this time around?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, it was Chen Feng and Luo Mingdao’s turn. The two of them handed their identification tokens to the supervising elder. A white-coloured, one square zhang spirit stone stood before Chen Feng. After placing their tokens on the white-coloured spirit stone, the spirit stone’s smooth, mirror-like surface immediately displayed Chen Feng and Luo Mingdao’s names.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The supervising elder nodded his head and returned the token to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, Brother Chen. Let’s find a place and have a good chat,” Luo Mingdao said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sure.” Chen Feng nodded. At any rate, it hadn’t been too long since he joined the sect. Luo Mingdao, on the other hand, had been cultivating in the sect since his younger days. He knew far more about various matters compared to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were simply too many disciples participating this time around. It took them quite a while to find a small, unoccupied pavilion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! Today is a very lively day for the sect,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally. In the past, everyone was busy cultivating. However, this is the time for them to display the results of their cultivation,” Luo Mingdao said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“By the way, why don’t I see Bai Ziyan?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Didn’t Brother Chen know?” Luo Mingdao said with a look of surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” Chen Feng grew more puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Sister Bai has entered Driftcloud Immortal Mountain,” Luo Mingdao said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What?!” Chen Feng was so shocked, he jumped to his feet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When did that happen?” Chen Feng hastily asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It has been more than two months now. So, Brother Chen did not know about this. I thought you knew,” Luo Mingdao said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thinking back, Chen Feng realized that it must have happened when he went out to perform the tasks for his core disciple promotion. No wonder he did not know about it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After knowing that Bai Ziyan had entered Driftcloud Immortal Mountain, Chen Feng could not stop himself from frowning. Although Driftcloud Immortal Mountain contained some opportunities, it was filled with even more dangers. Back then, if it were not for the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng would have been incapable of making it out from the mountain. Moreover, there was a high chance that he would have died inside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Chen Feng could not stop himself from worrying about Bai Ziyan’s safety.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry, Brother Chen. Senior Sister Bai is someone graced with immortal serendipity. Additionally, her cultivation base is high. After entering the immortal mountain, she will surely gain something from it,” Luo Mingdao said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, that is the case.” Chen Feng nodded. There was nothing he could do about it as well. All he could do was hope that Bai Ziyan could remain safe in the immortal mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Sister Bai could not participate in this time’s Grand Competition, otherwise she would certainly win one of the top spots,” Luo Mingdao said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, you fellows are over here.” Zhou You, Shui Yan and Luo Kong came over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Greetings, senior brothers.” Luo Mingdao immediately got up and saluted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha, no need to be so formal,” Shui Yan said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior brothers, you three have signed up as well?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Can you guess how many of our core disciples signed up this time around?” Shui Yan said, still smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are there 1,000?” Chen Feng curiously said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There were already over 1,000 when the three of us were signing up. He he! It’s funny, I didn’t know we have so many core disciples,” Shui Yan said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This time’s competition will be fierce,” Luo Kong lamented.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the sect’s Grand Competition had yet to begin, almost all the participating disciples had arrived. First, sign up. Then, draw lots for the assignment of their opponents. The victors get to stay while the losers will be eliminated. It was that simple.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Again, this simple method was both fair and unfair. If two experts were to encounter each other in the early fights, the weaker expert could only consider himself or herself unlucky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, luck was also a form of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, several fellow disciples that Chen Feng was acquainted with came to the small pavilion. One by one, they came. Some would come to have a chat or regulate their rate of breathing. Tacitly, they all came to an agreement to wait there. Not a single one returned to their residences.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One day quickly went by. The next day, when the rays of light from the sun descended, shouting sounds spread towards them from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The competition for inner disciples has begun,” Shui Yan said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In every Grand Competition, outer disciples are not eligible to participate. It has always been for inner, heir, elite and core disciples only. This time’s Grand Competition is of no exception. How about it? Anyone here wants to go have a look?” Luo Kong said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Forget it! Are the fights between inner disciples worth watching?” a disciple named Li Lang said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng pondered for a moment. Then, he brought out his Messaging Talisman and contacted Lu Ta. After finding out that Lu Ta’s match would only begin tomorrow, Chen Feng then sat down cross-legged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This pavilion is not bad.” Suddenly, several core disciples made their way into the pavilion. Just by hearing the tone of their voices, Chen Feng knew that they had ill intentions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Raising his head, Chen Feng saw five core disciples walking in. One of them was the one that Chen Feng had fought before, Chi Lianfeng. He also recognized another one. It was someone that he had gotten into a conflict with in the past, Zhao Hai. As for the other three, Chen Feng did not recognize them. However, just by looking at the arrogant expressions on the three fellows’ faces made Chen Feng displeased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows, vacate this place,” Zhao Hai said coldly after giving Chen Feng a glance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I haven’t seen Zhao Hai in a while. Surprisingly, his cultivation base has improved. Tsk, tsk. Looks like the Zhao Family has quite the foundation. However, they are wasting their spiritual medicines on an idiot.” Chen Feng ignored Zhao Hai. Instead, he turned to talk to Shui Yan, who was right beside him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“True.” Shui Yan laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!” Zhao Hai grew infuriated. His hand shot out, grasping at Chen Feng. Faint lightning bolts crackled between his five fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As someone who had overcome Lightning Tribulation, Zhao Hai could condense out Sky Lightning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng remained motionless. When Zhao Hai’s palm was about to reach him, however, his domain abruptly spread out to envelop Zhao Hai’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng’s domain spread out, the world within froze. Next, wind and thunder intersected one another before rising in intensity, the ground and mountains moved interdependently, water and fire aided each other. His Eight Trigrams domain circulated swiftly, giving off a shocking atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! You cannot even properly condense out your domain! You dare act arrogantly before all of us?” Seeing that, Zhao Hai laughed. The power of lightning crackling within his palm exploded, desirous of wounding Chen Feng in one fell swoop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng’s domain abruptly expanded to envelop Zhao Hai, freezing him in place. Next, a palm formed with the power of wind and thunder swung forward, slapping Zhao Hai away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of the disciples who came together with Zhao Hai swiftly rushed forward. His palm moved and he caught Zhao Hai. However, a palm print had appeared on Zhao Hai’s chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you-” Zhao Hai grew infuriated. His face grew feverishly red. Ashamed, he wanted to rush out to fight Chen Feng again. However, before he could do so, he felt his internal organs churning so badly he had to open his mouth and cough out a mouthful of blood. Next, he sat down weakly on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Like I said. A trash is a trash. No matter how much spiritual medicines you take, you are still just a type of trash,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle. As that was his first time utilizing his domain power, he could feel the unfathomable changes and power behind it. Thus, he was feeling happy. However, his usage of the domain was not smooth. He will need some time to reach full integration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This must be the new core disciple, Chen Feng,” said the tall disciple who had stepped forward to catch Zhao Hai earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One cannot be too arrogant. Especially if you have offended those that cannot be offended, otherwise there will be nothing good waiting for you,” the tall cultivator said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He Sanbo, Chi Lianfeng, it seems you fellows are here to stir up trouble.” Shui Yan stood up, a sneer on his face. Luo Kong and the others followed suit, looks of derision on their faces. Shui Yan and his pals could be considered a small group with a fairly steady standing. Thus, they were unlike the other disciples who would show fear towards these disciples with backers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So what if we are?” He Sanbo, the tall disciple, said icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like there is no need for us to wait until the Grand Competition. We can have one round right now.” Zhou You grasped with his hand and his Asura Blade – containing a chilling energy – appeared in his grasp. His silvery hair billowed upwards. He was actually getting ready to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chi Lianfeng, we did not get to finish it when we were back in the Core Hall. This time, let’s decide who is the victor and who is the loser,” Chen Feng said with a smirk. His domain kept circulating. Additionally, it was continuously expanding in size.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You think I’m afraid of you?” Chi Lianfeng said, bringing out his Wind Mustering Banner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I didn’t think we’d start fighting so soon.” Li Lang too, started flexing his hands and feet.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, the other disciples within the pavilion released their auras as well. To be able to come this far in their path of cultivation, was there any amongst them who lacked courage and savagery? Was there any who believed himself or herself to be inferior? Besides, Chi Lianfeng and his posse were the ones who came to provoke them in the first place. Now, they’ll simply have to teach these fellows a lesson.</span></p>
