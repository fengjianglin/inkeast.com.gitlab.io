 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What just happened?” asked a shocked Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Great Yaos from Azuremist Mountain must have taken action,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When you put it that way, the Great Yaos in Azuremist Mountain are quite the interesting bunch. Looks like they are deliberately doing this to train us,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That seems to be the case.” Lin Shaokun nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“At present, those on Nine Firmaments Palace’s side must be in a state of chaos. Say, if we take advantage of this chaos to attack, can we succeed in killing them off?” Chen Feng suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Brother Chen, to think that you can even think about this right now. Have you recovered your strength?” Jian Xiaotian asked, his voice tense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not yet. However, I don’t want to let such a good opportunity slip by,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Alright, let’s do it! They surrounded us just now. We must return the favour!” Lin Shaokun said icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Three little babies. You are already going to die. And yet, you still want to kill others? How laughable!” A ghastly voice suddenly drifted over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun charged forward simultaneously, each rushing towards a different direction. However, the three of them found nothing. When they turned around, however, each of them realized that the other two had disappeared from their sights.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What is going on?</span></em><span>&nbsp;The same thought appeared in the minds of all three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, Brother Lin!” Chen Feng shouted, his voice reverberating loudly. It was a voice capable of covering a distance of over 1,00 zhang. However, there was not a single response. All was still around him. Not a single blade of grass moved. Not even a gust of wind blew.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Looks like I have fallen into a magic array. That can’t be, though. I didn’t sense anything in advance</span></em><span>. Chen Feng felt puzzled. With a grasping motion, Bloody Soul appeared in his grip and he warily observed his surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! It is not a magic array. It is just an illusion technique. A pity, your cultivation base is too low, otherwise you can cultivate an eye technique to easily see through it. However, it still cannot affect the current you. You just need to utilize the Soul Subduing Mantra to break this illusion,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Illusion technique? To think that someone would secretly utilize an illusion technique against us. I wonder, who could it be? It is unlikely to be the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace,” Chen Feng replied and he utilized the Soul Subduing Mantra.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After utilizing the Soul Subduing Mantra, Chen Feng felt a formidable power pouring into his soul, making it as solid as iron. Nothing outside his sea of wisdom could disturb it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s eyes lit up and he saw Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun standing not far away from his position, staring blankly ahead while remaining motionless. It was as though someone had utilized some magic to fix their bodies in place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A black silhouette was slowly approaching Jian Xiaotian. However, when Chen Feng successfully broke the illusion gripping him, the black silhouette flinched. Then, it abruptly sped up. A withered-looking hand shot out from the black silhouette to grab Jian Xiaotian’s head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was quick to react; he hurled Bloody Soul forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he!” The black silhouette chortled, ignoring Chen Feng’s attack. The withered hand continued to move towards Jian Xiaotian’s head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bloody Soul pierced through the black silhouette. It had seemingly no effect on it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was shocked and he rushed forward as fast as he could. However, before Chen Feng could reach the black silhouette, it suddenly cried out miserably. A spark of fire had suddenly burst open to become raging flames, which burned the black silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? That is?” Chen Feng was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Die!” Jian Xiaotian, who was seemingly spacing out, suddenly attacked. His palm shot out with lightning-like speed and a sword beam bolted out, striking the black silhouette. Once again, it released another cry of misery. The black silhouette broke apart and a withered-looking old man emerged. The old man then attempted to flee.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was shocked. Unexpectedly, after having received two of Jian Xiaotian’s attacks, this fellow still had the strength to flee.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A staff swung forward and a booming sound rang out as the old man was battered to the ground. The might behind the blow caused a huge crater to appear on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun stood there with a nonchalant look on his face, the staff in his hand. Next, he stamped his foot and the unconscious old man’s body bounced up into his grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He is still alive despite that? This old man is quite something.” Chen Feng moved forward, feeling somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian swiftly grabbed the spatial magic treasure from the old man’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What should we do?” Lin Shaokun asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kill him. Someone else is coming,” Chen Feng gave a simple answer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun’s palm jerked and a potent force shot into the old man’s body, killing him while he was still unconscious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three of them moved forward, disappearing from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sound of footsteps quickly rang out and it did not take long for several cultivators to appear there. After reaching the place, the cultivators began searching around. At the same time, a few of them went to check the corpse left on the ground. From the looks of it, they appeared to be the elites of some great sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even so, Chen Feng’s team, who were hiding in the dark, could not determine their exact background. However, there was one thing about them that Chen Feng’s team was certain about, they were definitely not loose cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The one who died is Sage Fantasy,” one of the cultivators said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Sage Fantasy? I hear that this old guy had overcome 6 Lightning Tribulation! His Fantasy Magic is unpredictably divine. To think that he would die here. I wonder who did it?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who cares about that? We are here for the spirit stone mine!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Our Myriad Heresy Sect is on the rise once again. We need a high number of spirit stones. If we can find the Prized crystal mine, it would be a huge contribution. We will surely be rewarded when we return to the sect!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shut up! Did you forget what I said?” one of them shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right, right! It was my mistake, Third Senior Brother!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Myriad Heresy Sect? What kind of sect is that? I have never heard of it before. Are they not from the Northern Plains?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who? Come out!” Third Senior Brother suddenly unleashed a palm strike, causing several great trees before him to explode. A total of ten plus trees were shattered under the might of Third Senior Brother’s palm attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, Jian Xiaotian landed on the ground before walking towards them, his great sword in his grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, who are you? Why were you eavesdropping on our conversation? Are you the one who killed this old man?” Third Senior Brother stepped forward and shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“And who are you fellows?” Jian Xiaotian replied with a scoff. A grim expression flickered across his face. He had realized that several of these fellows possessed cultivation bases that were higher than his own.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph, insolence! Get over here! Kneel before talking to us!” a cultivator who was behind Third Senior Brother suddenly moved forward to send a punch towards Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The moment his fist flew out, the winds blew and rocks were blown out. The ground burst open as a fist silhouette formed using wind rushed towards Jian Xiaotian like a raging dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Raging Dragon Fist! Have a taste of my skill!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Lin, these fellows are formidable. I wonder where they are from? Later on, we’ll need to make use of the ensuing opportunity to attack, otherwise Brother Jian will suffer.” Chen Feng sent Lin Shaokun a secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry,” Lin Shaokun replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng and Lin Shaokun were communicating with each other, Jian Xiaotian had already begun fighting against them. After just one confrontation, Jian Xiaotian had been forced to back away. If it were not for Jian Xiaotian’s churning sword intent, which caused his opponent to hesitate somewhat, he would have been sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Four Lightning Tribulations?!” Jian Xiaotian was somewhat shocked. He was not surprised at his opponent’s cultivation level. Rather, he was surprised that his opponent could force him to retreat with this level of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Not bad, you are actually capable of blocking that punch of mine. Now, taste my Divine Tiger Fist!” The cultivator attacking Jian Xiaotian did not possess a particularly mighty stature. However, every move he made exuded a strong and ferocious atmosphere. He gave off an extraordinary image.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In Chen Feng’s opinion, this fellow’s strength was already a match to that of the core disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect. Rather, it was stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hegemon Sword Technique!” Jian Xiaotian, too, unleashed strong and ferocious moves to battle his opponent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Supple Snake Fist!” Suddenly, the opponent’s aura changed, becoming soft.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Goshawk Talons!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Spirit Ape Rush!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Poison Scorpion Sting!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brutal Bear Crash!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The attacks displayed by the cultivator were very peculiar. His attacks were imitating that of various wild beasts. And yet, his attacks were incomparably strong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Cha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, in the face of the opponent’s Goshawk Talons, Jian Xiaotian’s body armour was torn. After that, the opponent’s Brutal Bear Crash sent Jian Xiaotian flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng rapidly sped forward to catch Jian Xiaotian. He felt a wild power, one with seemingly no equal surging into his body, shocking him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun’s staff struck the opponent’s body. A banging sound rang out and the cultivator tumbled backwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a death wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Following the howls, two cultivators rushed towards Lin Shaokun. At the same time, two sword beams slashed towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The response from the cultivators was very good. Chen Feng, however, was not careless. He spread out his domain and unravelled the two sword beams shooting at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Lin Shaokun was swinging his staff around. Despite facing two opponents at once, he was able to obtain the upper hand in the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, are you all right?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m fine. However, where did these fellows come from? Their attacks are strong.” Although Jian Xiaotian was sent flying earlier, his aura did not weaken at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Myriad Ghosts Nethergrasp!” Suddenly, a sinister wind rose up all around them and a huge, black-coloured palm silhouette descended towards Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, wanting to capture them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was unknown just what kind of power was used to condense out the palm silhouette. It was completely black and it emanated a noxious stench. Sharp shrieks could also be heard coming from it, causing a shiver to run down their hearts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Palm of Wind and Lightning!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s domain power surged and a palm silhouette flashing with bolts of lightning swung upwards to meet the black palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A loud sound of collision rang out and Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were forced to back away. The trees around the spot that Chen Feng had been standing on earlier were all corroded, leaving only holes on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How dreadful! It actually contains such a potent poison!” Chen Feng said. Flames began burning within his domain to prevent the opponent’s poison from making it through.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two staff blows swung out in quick succession and the two cultivators engaging Lin Shaokun were sent flying. Next, Lin Shaokun rushed into Chen Feng’s domain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Remarkable! You have some skills. Let me exchange pointers with you!” Another cultivator from the other side stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hold it! Who are you fellows?” Suddenly, Third Senior Brother spoke up.</span></p>
