 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! I don’t even know how many cultivators from Nine, Purple and Transcendent Firmaments Palace I have killed, let alone you guys from Star Assembly Sect,” Chen Feng said, sending a heavy punch into the cultivator’s body to instantly burst his body into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Impressive! Impressive! Brother Chen, you are only at the Concealed stage. And yet, one punch from you could kill off a level 4 Sky Human stage cultivator. Nobody would believe it even if I tell them,” Jian Xiaotian praised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s heart stirred as well. He had only opened up two of the corresponding insight acupoints for level 9 of the Concealed stage. If he could open up all of them, how much stronger would he become? Additionally, if he could overcome his Lightning Tribulation, how much stronger would he become then?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, it looks like we might be in trouble. Our whereabouts have been exposed,” Chen Feng said, a frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! If it comes down to it, we can just carve a bloody path forward.” As Jian Xiaotian’s strength had improved greatly, he spoke confidently and killing intent soared out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is a distance of millions of kilometres between here and the Central Plains. If we want to get to the Central Plains, we will need to utilize a large-scale teleportation array. However, those teleportation arrays are all in large cities. If we try to enter the large cities, we will surely be captured on the spot,” Chen Feng said with a heavy tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Although we can soar into the sky, slip into the earth and cover a distance of 5,000 kilometres in a single day, we are still just low-level existences within Eternal World. Using our personal strength to reach the Central Plains will take a very long time. Besides, there are countless cultivators in the Northern Plains. Who knows just how many of them would try and stop us along the way?” Discussing the issue, Jian Xiaotian’s face revealed a look of concern.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough, let’s not talk anymore. More people have come. Let’s charge into the sky,” Chen Feng said. Next, the two of them flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The strong winds up in the sky were like blades, rampaging about without respite. Cultivators with lesser cultivation bases would quickly be inundated by those wind blades, their bodies sliced into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Several cultivators swiftly appeared on the grounds below Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. Focusing, Chen Feng’s gaze pierced through the strong winds and he was able to clearly see the cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There was a total of six cultivators, all at the Sky Human stage. Additionally, judging from their attires, they should be loose cultivators. Even so, Chen Feng dared not be careless. The cultivation bases of those six cultivators were quite good. Two of them were surprisingly at level 6 of the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are all experts. Should we attack?” Jian Xiaotian sent a secret vocal transmission to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s observe first,” Chen Feng replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They were here just now. Those fellows must be hiding nearby. Everyone, go look around,” said the cultivator with the highest cultivation base, his voice solemn.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the six cultivators split up to form an array, capable of both offence and defence. At the same time, they spread their soul powers out to scan their surroundings. Observing their actions, Chen Feng could tell that these fellows had been working together for quite some time now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! Go higher!” Seeing what the six cultivators were doing, Chen Feng immediately realized that things were not looking good for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, the six cultivators quickly discovered Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“On top!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The six cultivators swiftly flew up. In just the blink of an eye, they had covered a distance of 1,000 zhang and they surrounded Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, Jian Xiaotian! It really is you two. Looks like you were the ones who killed off those cultivators from Star Assembly Sect,” one of the six cultivators, a man with a squarish face, said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough! You should feel honoured to die in the hands of our Hunter Team.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the six of them were unleashing their attacks, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian flew up again, vaulting up by another 100 zhang. The strong winds there were more violent and their figures began swaying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng! Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A dimension spread out to envelop both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. Next, astral blasts – each sharper compared to a flying sword – smashed against the barrier of the dimension and were immediately broken to bits.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where do you think you’re going? Attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The six cultivators attacked simultaneously and the killer moves they unleashed fused together. In just a flash, their attacks smashed against the dimension that Chen Feng had created.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The dimension shook slightly. Although it had managed to block the attacks from the six cultivators, it was sent 100 zhang up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Phew! Thankfully, the Demon Sealing Sword is a Sacred artefact, otherwise they would have broken this dimension apart.” Seeing the dimension remain intact, Chen Feng breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chase!” The six cultivators displayed their ferocity. After exchanging glances, they too, flew higher.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were flying up, the winds pierced through one of the cultivators’ energy shield. Immediately after that, the cultivator was shredded into pieces by the surrounding winds. Next, a gust of wind scattered away the resulting mist of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! The winds here are too strong!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Join forces and attack once again!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The five cultivators fired out one attack after another. However, before their attacks could reach Chen Feng, they were all sliced and dispersed by the swift and powerful winds there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian made use of the opportunity to charge down. This time, Chen Feng had no desire to waste any time on them. Thus, he utilized the Demon Sealing Sword right from the start. Sword beams ran amok and four of the remaining five cultivators were killed. The final cultivator, the one with the highest cultivation base, was badly wounded but was able to slip down and flee. Chen Feng had wanted to give chase, but he had already disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We should quickly leave this place.” Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian exchanged glances before swiftly flying forward, only stopping after having covered a distance of over 500 kilometres. Then, they landed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They had only just landed when they sensed another powerful aura rushing forward. Clearly, more cultivators had been alarmed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian retracted their auras and swiftly left the place. Once again, they flew over 500 kilometres before finding a safe spot to land.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three days later, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian changed their outfits. Even their facial features had changed, the results of taking face-changing medicines.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Now that we have changed our appearances, it should be harder for them to find us, right?” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hard to say. However, we can give it a try. At any rate, there are no better options right now,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Truth be told, neither one of them were experts in changing appearances. However, Chen Feng was able to find some face-changing medicines amongst his hoard inside the Longevity Tower. Thus, they had the sudden notion of trying this out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their objective was a mid-sized city. In the beginning, the two of them felt somewhat concerned. However, after handing out 10 Magic crystals, they were able to smoothly enter the city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After entering the city, the two of them breathed a sigh of relief. Without pausing, they simply headed to the city’s teleportation array. Handing out another sum of Magic crystals, they then entered the teleportation array and were teleported through a distance of 50,000 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When their feet finally stepped on the hard earth, they released a lengthy breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! With this, we have teleported through 50,000 kilometres. This method is quite good!” Jian Xiaotian said, laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If so, let’s continue and head to the next city.” Chen Feng, too, laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian entered three mid-sized cities in a row and teleported through a total distance of nearly 250,000 kilometres. It went so smoothly, the two of them ended up in a state of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Northern Plains is too big, after all. No matter how powerful Nine Firmaments Palace may be, it cannot control everything,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come! Let’s head on to the next teleportation array!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, however, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian finally encountered an obstacle. This time, their target was a medium-large city under Star Assembly Sect’s jurisdiction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hold! Who are you two?” One of the soldiers guarding the city gate stepped forward and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am Zhang Ming. This here is Liu Jin. We are loose cultivators with no fixed residence,” Jian Xiaotian said with a smile. They had successfully used this shtick plenty of times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fifty Magic crystals!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The soldier did not care about that. After collecting the Magic crystals needed for entering the city, he let them go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, before Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian could make their way past the city gate, someone called out to them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hold it!” Like ghosts, two elders suddenly appeared to stop Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian’s path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Seniors, is there a problem?” Chen Feng asked, putting on a smile. However, he was already growing wary. The auras radiating from the two elders standing before him were very peculiar. He was actually incapable of determining their cultivation bases.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! So sneaky. Who are you fellows?” one of the elders asked with a deep and sinister tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am Zhang Ming and this is Liu Jin. We are loose cultivators.” Once again, Jian Xiaotian said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph, nonsense! You are clearly using a face-changing technique. You want to fool us? Reveal yourselves!” The eyes of one of the two elders shone and he took a stride forward as his hand stretched out, grasping at Jian Xiaotian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! We’ve been exposed! Run!” Instantly, Chen Feng brought out the Demon Sealing Sword and a sword beam formed using astral lightning shot towards the elder.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The elder’s response was swift. Surprisingly, he was able to dodge Chen Feng’s attack. The two elders displayed a peculiar move and they floated backwards at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry, run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian hurriedly charged out from the city. Potent energy waves surged out from their bodies and seven to eight cultivators were sent flying in the process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where do you think you’re going?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two teams of soldiers guarding the gate promptly charged forward to form an array, blocking the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng bellowed, swinging the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand with lightning-like speed. Next, a dazzling sword beam slashed out and everything in its path, be it the cultivators gathered at the gate or the soldiers blocking their path, were cleaved into two each. As Chen Feng was using his full power for the move, even the city walls were cut, leaving a sword mark of unknown depth on them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian dashed out from the city gate, one from the left and one from the right. Next, they swiftly charged into the sky. Their figures flashed forward a few times to put a distance of several li between them and the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! You want to run? Not so easy!” The two elders flew out from the city gate, their bodies emitting a faint starlight. Next, they disappeared. After that, two motes of starlight flashed within the sky before flying in pursuit of Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those two elders are very powerful. I was incapable of determining their cultivation bases.” At that moment, Jian Xiaotian’s body was enveloped by sword energy and he was flying as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder which sect they are from? Their cultivation bases are likely above level 6 of the Sky Human stage,” Chen Feng speculated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder if we can escape.” There was a note of urgency in Jian Xiaotian’s voice. This was clearly a sign of him exerting his all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It will likely be very difficult. They have already caught up to us,” Chen Feng said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was speaking, the two elders had re-appeared not too far behind them. They were quickly gaining on them.</span></p>
