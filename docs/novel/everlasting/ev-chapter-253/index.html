 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The City Lord is a Human Immortal after all. Since the two wyrms aren’t at the Yao King stage yet, they should be no match for the City Lord, no?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That would depend on how capable that City Lord is,” answered Tower with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The ground quaked and the entire city shook. With the participation of the Dark Yellow Wyrm, the battle grew more intense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Massive hurricanes, ice, fire, earth, stone, thunder and lightning flashed about ceaselessly and they erupted outwards. Everything within a radius of 1,000 zhang was destroyed. Furthermore, the radius was growing. The cultivators who failed to escape would find it impossible to survive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even Chen Feng’s team of three was blown far away by the resulting shockwaves. If it weren’t for Chen Feng’s hasty action of grabbing Shangguan Yun, she would have been swept up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No wonder a snake dares to come raise a ruckus. It turns out you found yourself a helper. However, do you think the two of you have what it takes to defeat me?” Brightbolt said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have only just reached the Human Immortal stage. Given one and a half years’ time, we would not have come to die. Today, however, the one to die will be you!” The Dark Yellow Wyrm’s voice was thick and heavy and it gave off a suffocating feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine. This place is not the place to do battle. Let’s go outside this city and have a duel,” said Brightbolt with a sneer. At any rate, he was the City Lord of Flashbolt City. It was only natural that he would not want the cultivators to die.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t think about escaping. If you do, we will return and kill off every one of the cultivators here,” shouted the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, three beams of light shot into the sky, disappearing in a flash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Immediately, a state of calm returned to the city. Next, however, a violent commotion rang out again. Although the two Great Yaos had left, the many yao beasts were still inside the city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was an extremely dire situation. Judging by the current situation, the continuous battle between the two sides would result in the cultivators from Flashbolt City getting utterly killed off by the yao beasts. It was just a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what should we do?” Tie Changkong cast a solemn look at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The three of us cannot change the situation. We can only do our best to kill as many of these yao beasts,” Chen Feng said, gritting his teeth. The bloody lance in his hand had grown blurry as it left blood-red after-images in the air. No matter how many yao beasts there were before him, none could block Chen Feng’s path.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for Chen Feng to carve out a bloody path. Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun followed Chen Feng, one on his left and one on his right. Given Chen Feng’s present level of strength, he did not even need to utilize his primary energy to deal with the weaker yao beasts. By simply depending on the might of his fleshly body and the tyrannical power of Bloody Soul, he was able to instantly kill off any of the ferocious yao beasts pouncing towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng bore a hole through each of the three large Sand Pythons before him, a path finally opened up before them. The three of them were finally about to break out from Flashbolt City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to make it this far, the three of them had killed several hundred yao beasts. No matter what, Chen Feng believed that they had contributed their fair share for the city. He did not believe there was a necessity for them to stay behind and fight to the death. He did not possess a fearless mindset, after all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Someone is coming! There are a lot of them!” Chen Feng abruptly turned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A mountain-like aura was quickly rising upwards and it rapidly pressed down against Flashbolt City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Could it be yao beasts?” exclaimed Tie Changkong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Flashbolt City was already on the brink of destruction. The appearance of more yao beasts would be the equivalent of pouring oil into fire.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not yao beasts, cultivators! They might be Flashbolt City’s reinforcements,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Iron Sword City is here to help!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A bellow spread across the entirety of Flashbolt City. Immediately after that, sky-shocking cries of joy rang out from within Flashbolt City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword cultivators in black clothes, each brandishing broad swords, charged into the city. A high number of yao beasts were killed off in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pill Talisman City is here to help!” Yet another sky-shocking bellow resounded. Before the cultivators could even make their appearance, a sky-encompassing number of shining talismans had descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of lightning bolts erupted. Like a chain, all the talismans were linked together by the lightning bolts. Any yao beast caught within the talismans’ range would cry out miserably and fall to the ground as it was reduced to ash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is the Five Thunders Astral Talisman.” Tie Changkong was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like they are from the other cities. It seems we are right. Flashbolt City is not the only city within the immortal mountain. There are other cities as well,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, the immortal mountain is just an ordinary space. I thought I would get to meet Immortal Humans.” Tie Changkong felt somewhat disappointed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not necessarily. Maybe, we have only been roaming around the outskirts. However, the spiritual energy inside is high and the cultivation environment is better compared to the outside world. There must surely be experts here,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are close to 1,000 cultivators in the reinforcing army. Amongst them are some Sky Human stage experts. Flashbolt City is saved now,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is time we leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the situation became a one-sided battle where yao beasts kept getting killed. In the end, they were completely routed and the human cultivators gained the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team of three had also successfully charged out from the city wall position. Once they left Flashbolt City’s area, their bodies felt light. Instantly, they vaulted upwards and rode their flying swords away. It did not take them long to fly over 50 kilometres away from the city and Flashbolt City became but a blurry outline on the horizon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I didn’t think the interior of the immortal mountain would be like this. In the beginning, I had assumed it to be some highly celestial existence,” Tie Changkong said with a smile as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In any case, we should think about how to get out. Although this place is good, our cultivation base is not good enough to explore about,” Chen Feng said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, we have been inside for quite some time now. Although the environment is good for cultivation, I am also missing the outside world,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whether we can go out or not is itself a question. Of the many cultivators to enter this place, only a few managed to get out. For me, it is not so bad to cultivate inside as long as I can increase my cultivation base.” Tie Changkong did not mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Amongst the three of them, Tie Changkong had spent the longest practicing cultivation. Thus, his patience was not something that Chen Feng and Shangguan Yun could compete against. Moreover, the hearts of sword cultivators were usually firmer. So long as they could increase their cultivation base, they would be able to endure, even in the harshest of environments. Not to mention, they were presently inside the immortal mountain, filled with spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After leaving Flashbolt City, the three of them began moving about aimlessly once more. As the three of them already possessed some experience, they carefully sensed the thickness of the surrounding spiritual energy and moved according to the spiritual energy lines. They moved towards wherever the spiritual energy was thickest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For the next 10 days, the three of them would occasionally encounter and kill some lesser yao beasts. Other than that, however, nothing else of note happened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng wanted to find a place to open his Water acupoint. After hearing from Tower that one drop of Vile Fountain Water was enough to accomplish that, Chen Feng had spent the past few days testing it. After absorbing merely 30 % of one drop of the Vile Fountain Water, Chen Feng had managed to find the location of the Water acupoint. As such, Chen Feng became restless. He could feel it. Opening up the Water acupoint was already in the bag.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, as they were about to fly out of the desert, the three of them encountered Liu Tian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Tian was not alone. There were four cultivators beside him. Although the four cultivators’ cultivation bases were not comparable to Liu Tian’s, they had already cultivated out their domain powers. One of them was, in fact, on the same level as Liu Tian, level 9 of the Concealed stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When the two parties met each other, they grew stunned. They did not think they would meet each other there. Chen Feng noticed the sinister glint flashing across Liu Tian’s eyes. However, when Chen Feng turned to properly gaze at Liu Tian, his face had returned normal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Tie, I didn’t think I would meet you fellows here. I was wondering what to do in order to find you all.” Liu Tian was the first to speak up, a hint of enthusiasm in his voice. Hearing him, those who did not know what happened between them would have thought that the two of them had a good relationship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, what a coincidence. Thank you, Brother Liu, for your concern. Our wounds are all healed up. Additionally, we got lucky and our cultivation bases have improved yet again,” Tie Changkong said with a somewhat cold tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only then did Liu Tian realized that both Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun had reached level 9 of the Concealed stage and a slightly astonished look appeared on his face. However, he was in fact highly shocked. He wondered what kind of benefits the two of them managed to obtain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When he looked at Chen Feng, Liu Tian’s eyes revealed a hint of fear. Although Chen Feng remained at level 4 of the Concealed stage, Liu Tian had a feeling that Chen Feng was the strongest amongst the three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Liu, who are these three?” someone beside Liu Tian finally spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The one who spoke up revealed a highly haughty expression on his face. A look of disdain appeared on his face as he glanced at Chen Feng. He was also an elite disciple from Nine Firmaments Palace, the one at level 9 of the Concealed stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If you want to inquire other people’s names, you should first introduce yourself.” Tie Changkong showed indifference towards them. Since Tie Changkong had reached level 9 of the Concealed stage, he was even entertaining the thought of duking it out with Liu Tian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You!” Killing intent glinted within the cultivator’s eyes. However, he quickly concealed his killing intent. He was still somewhat fearful of the madness of those cultivators from Sword Hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nine Firmaments Palace, Luo Daoxing,” he said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Hall, Tie Changkong,” Tie Changkong said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, Shangguan Yun and the other three introduced themselves. The other three were cultivators from Jade Talisman Sect and all three were at level 8 of the Concealed stage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Yu Yangtian, Yu Jingyang, Yu Luoping. They were Jade Talisman Sect’s elite disciples. Hailing from the biggest family within Jade Talisman Sect, they possessed a great backing. As such, the arrogance etched upon their faces was even one notch higher compared to Luo Daoxing’s.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Say, Brother Tie, why are you two bringing a burden along with you?” Yu Jingyang immediately began provoking them. Perhaps the word provoking was not too apt. He was openly looking down on Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In their eyes, Chen Feng, a level 4 Concealed stage cultivator, was nothing more than a small fry. Back in their sect, cultivators of this level were not fit to even carry their shoes for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng said nothing in the face of their disdainful gazes. He simply put on a humble smile. When he turned to look at Liu Tian, his smile grew wider.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Tian had not said anything and appeared happy to see what was transpiring. He had been maliciously hoping that the two sides would seriously fight each other. However, when he saw Chen Feng’s smile, for some strange reason, he felt a chill running down his heart. Thus, he retracted his glance and simply looked forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are you saying? Junior Brother Chen is a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. We are all from the Ten Great Sects of the Northern Plains. Taking care of one another is only natural,” said Tie Changkong as a-matter-of-factly.</span></p>
