 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing Yu Qingshan’s words, Lei Batian’s face alternated between flushed and pale. It was quite an embarrassed look. It was true. Extreme Celestial Sect had not responded at all to the recent hunt for Chen Feng. This incident had caused many of the disciples from Extreme Celestial Sect to feel disillusioned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Do you have nothing to say? I didn’t think that Extreme Celestial Sect is an existence that can only bully the weak and cower before the strong. If Extreme Celestial Sect keeps this up, it will no longer be qualified to be called one of the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects of the Northern Plains,” Yu Qingshan said, sneering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Yu Qingshan was not the only one. Many of the cultivators there were also sending ridiculing sneers at the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are not here for the sake of some immortal mountain. Rather, we are here to protect Chen Feng. I have heard that there are many cultivators hunting our sect’s disciple. Hey, hey! No matter who that person may be, anyone who dares hunt down our disciples will have to answer to us,” Hua Zhuliu said calmly. However, there was a surprising tone of forcefulness within his voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right! This time, we’ll have some fellows understand that our Extreme Celestial Sect is not to be trifled with! Our disciples are not existences that some nobodies could think about offending. I didn’t think that our recent silence would be interpreted as a sign of weakness. Even some loose cultivators now dare to act wantonly. This time, I must start a massacre!” Lei Batian said, killing intent surging out from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Hua Zhuliu, Lei Batian. Do you two represented Extreme Celestial Sect’s will? Does Extreme Celestial Sect want to start a war with our Nine Firmaments Palace?” Sun Wenxuan sneered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whether or not this is Extreme Celestial Sect’s will, you fellows will find out soon enough,” Hua Zhuliu replied with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you mean by that?” Sun Wenxuan’s eyes flashed with a chilling glint as he stared at Hua Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack!” Lei Batian suddenly howled, his voice reverberating outwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, waves of formidable auras swept upwards from a distant spot. Sensing the formidable auras, Sun Wenxuan and the others were astounded. Every single one of the auras represented a formidable cultivator. The number of auras charging upwards had exceeded 50!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Extraordinary! Extreme Celestial Sect dispatched so many experts this time around. Are they actually going to start a war with Nine Firmaments Palace?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Many of the cultivators there could not stop wondering.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The formidable auras moved rapidly and the loose cultivators who were observing the situation from afar began releasing cries of misery.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The loose cultivators were getting torn apart and their broken body parts fell, causing blood to dye the sky red. In but the blink of an eye, tens of loose cultivators had been killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, a roar erupted from somewhere within the sky. One by one, the loose cultivators struck by the soundwave attack fell down. However, Pot Mountain was right beneath them. When the wounded loose cultivators fell on Pot Mountain, the energy ripples that Pot Mountain radiated immediately quaked them to their deaths.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A massacre.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was an open massacre. Extreme Celestial Sect had dispatched a high number of experts to kill off the loose cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It all lasted for a few breaths’ worth of time. In the beginning, the attacks left the loose cultivators dumbfounded. Then, the attacks left the loose cultivators either badly wounded or just dead. Finally, the attacks sent the remaining loose cultivators packing in a haphazard manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, the 50 cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect had killed off hundreds of loose cultivators who were hanging around to observe the situation. The loose cultivators could not even put up a fight against the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What a powerful show of force! Is Extreme Celestial Sect so powerful? Or did they dispatch their secret forces?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Yu Qingshan and the others exchanged glances as they wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Many of these loose cultivators had participated in the hunt for Chen Feng. Even if they did not, they did come here in order to hunt down Chen Feng. This is Extreme Celestial Sect’s response. Regardless if they are loose cultivators or cultivators from other sects, those who dare provoke Extreme Celestial Sect, look to these dead cultivators for an example,” Hua Zhuliu said icily, his gaze sweeping past all the cultivators present. It caused a sensation of pressure to bear down on these cultivators from the great sects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! You only have the guts to kill some loose cultivators,” said a cultivator from Nine Firmaments Palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! What’s the rush? If you cannot wait, I can send you to death’s door right now!” Lei Batian said, laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is this the decision of Extreme Celestial Sect’s Sect Master?” Sun Wenxuan asked with a cold tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You can stop asking about that.” Lei Batian replied with a savage grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Have the guys from Extreme Celestial Sect gone mad? They dare offend Nine Firmaments Palace? Additionally, they killed so many loose cultivators!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. What is up with Extreme Celestial Sect? Why did they suddenly decide on such a heavy-handed move? Extreme Celestial Sect is usually unwilling to face Nine Firmaments Palace head on. Did something happen to Extreme Celestial Sect?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t think so. Maybe these cultivators decided to take action by themselves.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, no. Earlier, there were 50 cultivators amongst their attack force. Even the weakest amongst them has overcome 5 Lightning Tribulations. Add Hua Zhuliu and these fellows here, the forces that Extreme Celestial Sect dispatched this time has exceeded the combined might of our three sects here!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were discussing the issue, almost all of the surrounding loose cultivators scattered away. In the end, even some who were still lurking around were found by the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect and killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This tyrannical display by Extreme Celestial Sect caused Sun Wenxuan’s eyelids to twitch uncontrollably as he began wondering himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for the remaining loose cultivators to be dealt with. Then, the 50 cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect gathered, giving off a formidable momentum capable of suffocating others. More importantly, they had just killed off the loose cultivators. Thus, the waves of killing intent rising from their bodies were particularly high. When they arrived, they glared at the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace, seemingly ready to pounce and kill them at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the killing intent unleashed by the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect, the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace reflexively brought out their weapons and magic treasures.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I didn’t think that Extreme Celestial Sect could become so arrogant.” Someone suddenly spoke up. It was someone from Transcendent Firmaments Palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Nine Firmaments Palace, Transcendent Firmaments Palace and Purple Firmaments Palace shared the same roots. In the face of an enemy, the three of them would work together to defeat this enemy. If it were not for this, one sect alone would not be able to act like a king in the Northern Plains.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. It looks like Extreme Celestial Sect wants to start a war,” said another cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! If anyone doesn’t like the way we act, just take action. It doesn’t matter how powerful our opponents are. If it comes down to it, we’ll just fight it out to the bitter end,” Hua Zhuliu said coolly. He showed no fear in the face of the pressure exerted by the three sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right! If you want to attack, just attack! Who’s afraid? This senior is itching for a fight!” Lei Batian shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Count me in! My hands are also feeling itchy,” said Sword Hall’s Mo Xuan as his figure flew to hover beside Hua Zhuliu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! What a lively event! How can I miss out on this?” Yu Qingshan flew over as well, a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cough! Cough! You actually wounded me. I cannot let this slide.” Despite having taken some medicinal pills, Elder Xue’s face remained pale. His wounds would not heal so quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Guys, don’t fight. Right now, the most important matter is to figure out how to enter Pot Mountain and find treasures.” While there were those who wanted to fight, there were also those who did not want to participate in the fight. In comparison, the immortal mountain beneath was more alluring. That was especially so after they received news about the existence of immortal energy within the mountain. Due to that, the rate of breathing of some of the cultivators there had turned raggedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>These cultivators were only at the Sky Human stage. If cultivators at their level wished to absorb immortal energy, they would have to first cultivate up to the Human Immortal stage. Thus, for those whose cultivation bases were beneath the Human Immortal stage, the immortal energy was unquestionably a very high-grade spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>If they could absorb immortal energy for their cultivation efforts before even reaching the Human Immortal stage, their future would be limitless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Was it any wonder why these cultivators would become so excited, to the point of shouting? Every one of the cultivators there was at the Sky Human stage, something that could only be achieved by the best of the best. Amongst these bests of the best, however, how many could confidently say that they could cultivate up to the Human Immortal stage? Likely, none.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that very moment, however, there was a good opportunity standing right before their eyes. If they could absorb immortal energy, it would not be impossible for them to advance to the Human Immortal stage in the future. Thus, it was only normal for these people’s eyes to go red from excitement. If it were not for the fact that there were many other cultivators around and that it would not look good for them, they would have clamoured raucously in excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. Right now, what we should be doing is to figure a way to enter the immortal mountain. Now is not the time to be fighting!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We cultivators pursue immortality, everlasting longevity. There is presently a golden opportunity lying before our very eyes. We must not miss out on this. If you fellows really want to fight, wait until this is over before you start your fight!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The other cultivators there said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, something else happened to Pot Mountain. It quaked fiercely for a moment. Next, a hole cracked open from a spot halfway up the mountain and a thick amount of immortal energy sprayed out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;“Eh? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It looks like a crack appeared on the immortal mountain!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Immortal energy! This is immortal energy! The thing spraying out from the immortal mountain is immortal energy!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the amount of immortal energy spraying out from the crack grew, the cultivators fell into a state of frenzy. One after another, they charged forward, howling as they hastily absorbed the immortal energy spraying out from the crack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the exception of the cultivators from Extreme Celestial Sect, the other cultivators stopped what they were doing and charged towards Pot Mountain instead. They pushed and squeezed their way forward and some with weaker cultivation bases were sent flying as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened? Why did immortal energy suddenly spray out from Pot Mountain? Did something happen inside?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A hole has appeared on Pot Mountain. In other words, we can use this hole to enter the immortal mountain!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes! Hurry, rush in! This is a good opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A few cultivators who were quick to react rushed towards the crack. In the blink of an eye, several cultivators had charged into Pot Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, the eyes of the other cultivators who were absorbing immortal energy lit up. Immediately, all of them stopped absorbing the immortal energy and instead charged towards the crack instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The immortal energy was spraying out from Pot Mountain. Judging by that, the interior of Pot Mountain should possess even more items that were better than immortal energy. There might even be immortal-tier pills and Immortal artefacts inside it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Witnessing other cultivators making their way into Pot Mountain, the remaining cultivators fell into a mad state of fervour. These figures who would normally display looks of indifference towards everything had seemingly transformed into little children who had just seen candies. They struggled to charge forward, wanting a bite of the candy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, however, an overpowering force blasted out from the crack and many of the cultivators who attempted to rush in were either killed or wounded. Next, the crack disappeared and no more immortal energy sprayed out from Pot Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sudden changes to Pot Mountain threw the cultivators into an even greater state of confusion. Some even began cursing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going on here? The crack was right there! Why did it suddenly disappear?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It must have been due to those fellows who entered earlier. Now, the crack is no more. Likewise, there is no more immortal energy. Meanwhile, we are still incapable of entering.”</span></p>
