 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span><em>A Skysoar Shuttle!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had assumed that it was the Thunderhawk flying at him. However, peering through the foliage, he saw a black Skysoar Shuttle flying overhead. Additionally, it was moving at an incredibly fast pace. It disappeared from sight in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s heart gave a thump and he swiftly rushed out from the foliage of leaves. Next, sword light flashed out around his body as the Overwhelming Astral Sword quickly expanded beneath Chen Feng’s feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Riding his flying sword, Chen Feng chased after the disappeared Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had sensed that the Skysoar Shuttle was of a very high grade. The oppressive atmosphere that it radiated far outstripped that of the Thunderhawk. In other words, the one controlling the Skysoar Shuttle was most likely a Sky Human stage cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was presently incapable of finding the way to leave the forest, following the route taken by the Skysoar Shuttle should be a good choice. At the very least, it was better than running around aimlessly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the Skysoar Shuttle was moving at an incredible velocity, by the time Chen Feng rose up into the sky, it had long disappeared from view. Even so, Chen Feng continued flying forward, going in the same direction as the Skysoar Shuttle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng channelled all his power into the Overwhelming Astral Sword, making it go faster and faster. He felt as though there was a bell-mouth spillway continuously absorbing the energy within him. Feeling the rate at which his power was being consumed, Chen Feng felt shocked. It was rare for him to channel all his power into the Prized artefact, after all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Impressive. I didn’t think that my power could be consumed so quickly by going all out with it,” Chen Feng uttered in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, this is quite the amazing speed. At this rate, I can probably cover 50,000 kilometres per day.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After flying over 500 kilometres, Chen Feng encountered some other cultivators. They were familiar faces, too. They were none other than Liu Tian and the others. Likewise, they were also flying swiftly in the same direction as Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Humph! It seems they have the same idea as me.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng sneered inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the one in the lead was Liu Tian. Additionally, he was riding a Prized-tier flying sword. Liu Tian’s flight speed was astonishing. He was actually even faster than Chen Feng. It did not take long for him to gradually disappear from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Following him were Tie Changkong and the others. To Chen Feng’s astonishment, with the exception of Liu Xihua, the others possessed their own Prized artefacts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Observing Tie Changkong, Shangguan Yun and Xu Ziping riding Prized artefacts through the sky, Chen Feng almost swore out. They clearly possessed Prized artefacts. If they had joined forces to fight against the Thunderhawk, they may not necessarily lose. Unexpectedly, they had all chosen to split up and flee the moment the Thunderhawk appeared. Thinking back to how they left him and ran away on their own the last time, Chen Feng grew even more infuriated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These fellows are truly bastards. I didn’t think they could be so cowardly despite having Prized artefacts.” Chen Feng could not stop himself from swearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh, it’s Chen Feng. He has come as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and the others saw Chen Feng. One by one, the expressions on their faces changed. That was especially true for Xu Ziping and Liu Xihua. Traces of killing intent flashed across their eyes. Thanks to Chen Feng bringing the Thunderhawk over, the two of them were substantially wounded. Seeing Chen Feng brought a feeling of displeasure to them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Guys, what do we do? Do you want to join forces to kill him?” Xu Ziping suddenly suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey! Chen Feng is a disciple of Extreme Celestial Sect. Are you not afraid that you might never be able to get out of the Northern Plains if you kill him?” Tie Changkong, who was beside him, sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If not for Chen Feng bringing the Thunderhawk over, we wouldn’t have been wounded,” said Liu Xihua.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As I recall, Chen Feng saved you before. Are you thinking of attacking him now? Oh, right. You are the only one amongst us who do not possess a Prized artefact. It seems you are interested in Chen Feng’s Prized artefact. To think that disciples of Starfall Sect are of this quality. This is an eye opener,” Tie Changkong continued with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tie Changkong, do not forget. Back when Chen Feng found the Thunderhawk, you also chose to run away.” Liu Xihua’s face reddened somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am no match for the Thunderhawk. Running away is only natural. Am I supposed to stay behind and wait for death? Our Sword Hall may be good at fighting, but we don’t joke around with our lives.” After saying that, Tie Changkong gave the distant Chen Feng a glance. After that, the flying sword he was riding on radiated a dazzling light and the speed at which he was flying forward rose by three notches. It did not take him long to leave them behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Witnessing the three arguing, Shangguan Yun had said nothing. After seeing Tie Changkong increase his flying speed, she too, channelled her magic power and her flying speed gradually increased as well. Soon enough, she was chasing up to Tie Changkong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Flowing Cloud Hall’s Sky Soaring Formula is indeed extraordinary. To think that it could unleash such power when complemented with a magic treasure,” praised Tie Changkong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You overpraise. Your Sword Hall’s sword formulas still possess the strongest offensive power,” Shangguan Yun replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you think of Chen Feng’s cultivation level?” Tie Changkong suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am unable to see through him. Surface wise, he appears to be a level 4 Concealed stage cultivator. However, he has condensed out his Soulflame. Most importantly, he has also refined a Prized artefact,” Shangguan Yun said softly, her brows furrowing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Additionally, he possesses more than one Prized artefact on him. What happened last time was our fault. No matter how you cut it, he had given us a warning regarding the Thunderhawk’s appearance. Instead, we simply ran away. That is against the spirit of our sword cultivation,” Tie Changkong said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why? Are you regretting it? Chen Feng is right behind us. You can go apologize to him,” Shangguan Yun said with an ambiguous smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We sword cultivators have a certain cultivation spirit. We do not regret our actions.” Tie Changkong’s face regained its indifferent expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun going ahead, Liu Xihua and Xu Ziping exchanged glances. They could not help but swear out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. Brother Liu, I will be taking my leave first.” After saying that, Xu Ziping began increasing his flying speed. Shockingly, his flying speed nearly doubled. It did not take him long to catch up to Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun. After that, he overtook them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is a Lightstream Shield, a flying-type magic treasure. Additionally, it is at the Prized-tier. No wonder it can fly so quickly.” Tie Changkong was somewhat shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That Xu Ziping is from the Xu Family of the Central Plains. It is only natural that he would possess such a magic treasure,” said Shangguan Yun with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time Chen Feng caught up to them, Liu Xihua was the only one trailing behind. As he was the only one without a Prized artefact, he had to watch as Tie Changkong and the others slowly pull away, leaving him in the dust. Inevitably, a feeling of resentment grew within him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng quickly caught up to Liu Xihua. Without even glancing at Liu Xihua, Chen Feng continued flying forward. He had actually considered killing off Liu Xihua. However, he was concerned that his actions would come to light, bringing trouble to himself. At any rate, Tie Changkong and the others had seen him flying towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng fly past him, Liu Xihua opened his mouth. However, he did not say anything in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s flying speed gradually rose. Bit by bit, he closed the distance between him and Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun. He wanted to know how fast he can go and how much primary energy he possessed. Thus, he fervently channelled all the power within his body and poured them into the Overwhelming Astral Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Chen Feng was even with Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Chen, I didn’t realize that you hid your abilities so deeply,” Tie Changkong was the first to speak up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just a minor trick,” said Chen Feng coolly. Then, he began to fly ahead of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was flying, he suddenly turned and said, “Right, you two better fly faster. Danger is coming soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Danger, what danger?” Tie Changkong was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not answer. Instead, he focused even more into channelling his power into his flying sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A look of surprise flashed across Shangguan Yun’s face. After considering it for a moment, she called out loudly, “Chen Feng, we are all from immortal dao sects. We should be helping each other in here. What did you mean by danger?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Thunderhawk is about to catch up,” Chen Feng replied coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was looking at the Thousand Seeker Mirror on his palm. There was a small, black dot on its surface. The dot was constantly on the move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Huh! Hopefully, I can get out of this forest this time. There will be no need to keep running anymore, then</span></em><span>. Having reached that line of thought, Chen Feng stretched out both hands. The Thousand Seeker Mirror and Bloody Soul within his Four Extreme acupoints trembled simultaneously and two streams of formidable power surged out. Their appearance nearly shredded Chen Feng’s meridians.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s flying speed rose up again by a large margin. Only someone as monstrous as Chen Feng could channel three magic treasures at the Concealed stage. Even so, Chen Feng felt it was too much. He could clearly feel the rate at which his primary energy was being consumed. Even his Soulflame had begun trembling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? How could he fly so fast? Is he burning his Soulflame?” Xu Ziping, who was rapidly flying ahead, felt shocked. Chen Feng was rapidly gaining on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Save me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, Liu Xihua, who was left behind, shouted out. A terrifying atmosphere of suppression was coming from behind him. It was none other than the Thunderhawk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunderhawk was a flying creature, proficient at flying. Adding its power at the Great Yao stage, even the flying speed of a Sky Human stage cultivator would be far inferior compared to this Thunderhawk. What else could be expected from Concealed stage cultivators like Liu Xihua?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good! The Thunderhawk has caught up!” Both Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun revealed grim expressions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Should we hide inside the forest again?” Tie Changkong suggested.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Given how low our numbers have become, hiding in the forest is no longer a good choice,” said Shangguan Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Tie, Senior Sister Shangguan, pull me forward!” Liu Xihua shouted from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the Great Yao’s pursuit, both Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun were already having trouble staying alive. How could they bring a burden along with them?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun ignore him, a look of hatred flashed across Liu Xihua’s eyes. He then gritted his teeth and descended into the dense forest. In the blink of an eye, his figure disappeared amidst the dense number of leaves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunderhawk’s broad wings flapped rapidly and one hurricane after another descended. At the same time, the Thunderhawk’s massive body swiftly shrunk as he took the form of the wild-looking man once more to chase after Liu Xihua.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh, Liu Xihua is probably a goner this time,” said Tie Changkong, who shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You still have time to worry about others? Better worry about how we are going to escape this calamity,” Shangguan Yun said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
