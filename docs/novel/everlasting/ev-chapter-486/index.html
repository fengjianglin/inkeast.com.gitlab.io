 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A Yao King!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every one of the cultivators there exclaimed. None of them expected a Yao King to appear at a time like this. Additionally, it would appear that this was an abnormally ferocious Yao King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One flying sword after another kept striking the ape’s body. However, the ape did not attempt to dodge the attacks at all because the attacks were incapable of leaving even shallow wounds on its body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>From what the cultivators there could see, there was no difference at all between this ape and the apes that they had encountered along the way. They looked similar. It even had the same size as those normal apes. However, the aura radiating out from this ape’s body was simply too savage. Additionally, it was even faster. In just the blink of an eye, many of the cultivators there had died to the ape. Even more horrifying was the fact that their attacks were completely incapable of harming this ape who was impervious to weapons, fire and water.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When he found out that this ape was a Yao King, Chen Feng smiled. However, the other cultivators grew terrified. That was especially true of the loose cultivators who were watching nearby. They began running away. Even so, some had still tried to rush towards the Domain Tree. At any rate, it hadn’t been easy to come across a Heaven-defying spiritual tree. It would be too much of a loss to not get something out from it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing those fellows risk their lives to rush forward, a derisive look appeared within Chen Feng’s eyes. From the information Tower had provided him and what he had seen of the Domain Tree’s might, Chen Feng concluded that it would be very difficult for these cultivators to break the Domain Tree’s attacks and approach it. Naturally, Chen Feng was also interested in experiencing for himself how powerful the Domain Tree’s attacks can be. That was also why Chen Feng was continuing to stand there without moving forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s a Yao King! This is a good opportunity. Junior Brother Chen, let’s hurry up and leave this place,” Mu Qingfeng quickly said. Although Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin had decent cultivation bases, they knew their limits. Seeing the Yao King pounce at Mo Hong’s group, Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin knew that their opportunity had arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. However, senior brothers, you two can leave first,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Chen, what are you planning? This is a Yao King. It is the equivalent of a Human Immortal!” Zhang Xuanjin said apprehensively.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry, I know my limits.” Chen Feng remained standing there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin looked at one another and quickly discussed the issue for a bit. Then, with a furious nod, they stood beside Chen Feng, not leaving the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing them choose to stay surprised Chen Feng. However, he did not think too much about it as he was focused more on the Yao King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of the charging Yao King, everyone felt anxious. However, Mo Hong and his gang chose to neither retreat nor leave. Instead, Mo Hong stared intently at the Yao King. It seemed as though he was preparing a move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is there to fear? There are so many of us. Can we not kill off an ape?” a cultivator from Nine Firmaments Palace shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is unlike the apes we encountered earlier! This is a Yao King!” someone shouted dreadfully. The cultivators who had gathered up to fight Chen Feng’s team of three earlier swiftly dispersed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! A bunch of morons,” Mo Hong said with a ridiculing smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ten Thousand Threads!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators from Purple Firmaments Palace made their move and a high-grade Prized artefact quickly spread out. It was a net forged using various rare materials. They controlled it using their magic powers and used it to block the Yao King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mo Hong then brought out a black iron block out and hurled it upwards. The iron block hovered in the sky and Mo Hong’s hands formed one hand seal after another, causing the iron block to continuously expand in size, growing more indistinct as it did. It looked as though there were countless iron blocks stacked atop one another, or was the iron block continuously splitting up into more iron blocks that looked completely identical?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They really do possess Sacred artefacts. No wonder they did not run away,” Chen Feng whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact! They really brought a Sacred artefact inside!” Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin exchanged glances and a trace of panic flashed across their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! What is so strange about this? Did our Extreme Celestial Sect not bring any Sacred artefacts inside?” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally, we did. Unfortunately, there is no way any of them could end up with us. They are with the other stronger senior brothers.” Mu Qingfeng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wonder what is the function of this fellow’s Sacred artefact,” Chen Feng asked smilingly, looking at the increasingly grim expression on Mo Hong’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It should be the Iron Cage,” Zhang Xuanjin said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Iron Cage?” Chen Feng was puzzled. He had never heard of this type of magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is a magic array-type magic treasure. You will understand by observing on, Junior Brother Chen.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Ten Thousand Threads net blocking the ape was easily ripped to shreds and the Purple Firmaments Palace’s cultivator revealed a look of pain. A high-grade Prized artefact was ripped apart just like that. Moreover, it had only managed to stop the ape for a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, that short moment was enough. The magic treasure that Mo Hong hurled upwards had begun revealing its might. The dark iron block had already transformed into an indistinct-looking cage with a radius of 10 zhang. Its black rays of light seemingly fused together with space to entrap the ape within it. It was as though a freshly-caught wild beast had been thrown into an iron cage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was the Iron Cage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To Chen Feng’s surprise. The ape, which had revealed an incomparable display of ferocity, failed to break free after struggling for a bit. Rather, it grew furious and howled as the Iron Cage shrank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So powerful?” Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If they had utilized this magic treasure from the beginning, they could have captured the three of us by now.” Mu Qingfeng’s face was somewhat ugly to behold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Junior Brother Chen. We still have an opportunity. Let’s hurry up and leave this place!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why leave? There is such a big spiritual tree here. In the outside world, even Human Immortals would be fighting to the death for it. If we leave now, we’ll be regretting it for life,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This spiritual tree is indeed good. However, if we stay here, we’ll end up dying. No matter how valuable this spiritual tree may be, it is not as valuable as our lives,” Mu Qingfeng advised Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, our lives are the most important things here. However, we will not die here today. No matter what, I must obtain this spiritual tree,” Chen Feng said in a hushed tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mu Qingfeng and Zhang Xuanjin sighed. They did not understand how Chen Feng could be so confident. Disregarding the fact that it was very difficult to approach the spiritual tree, Mo Hong and the others were not easy to deal with. However, since Chen Feng was not leaving, as his senior brothers, they must not leave as well. Even if they managed to escape by leaving Chen Feng behind, they would become ashamed of themselves when news of this spread out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Someone else has broken in!” someone suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, everyone was wholly focused on the Yao King. At that very moment, however, they could see several cultivators making their way past the peripheral area of the Domain Tree. They were rapidly rushing towards a branch filled with fruits.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The thought process behind their actions was simple. Given their present situation, they would be incapable of getting the spiritual tree. Thus, in order to ensure that this trip was not in vain, they wanted to pluck a few of the fruits there. The fruit growing out from a spiritual tree with such a high spiritual attribute must surely be extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows have a death wish!” Mo Hong was infuriated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mo Hong, you deal with the Yao King. We’ll kill those fellows,” said a cultivator from Nine Firmaments Palace as he led their team to charge the cultivators who remained. They unleashed their killer moves the instant they met the cultivators and it did not take long for two of the cultivators to fall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nine Firmaments Palace, what are you fellows doing?” one of the cultivators shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Naturally, we’re killing off you fellows! You only have yourselves to blame for being greedy. If you fellows had left right from the start, you could have survived, but now, all of you will die here,” the cultivator from Nine Firmaments Palace laughed scornfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Speaking of which, it was quite peculiar. Every one of the cultivators on Nine Firmaments Palace’s side had charged forward to attack the other cultivators. It was unknown whether it was intentional or not, but not a single one of them attacked Chen Feng’s team of three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bai Yunyan’s figure darted forward to appear before Chen Feng. During the earlier state of chaos, someone had actually attacked Bai Yunyan, infuriating her. However, after Bai Yunyan managed to dodge the attack, the attacking cultivator had stopped attacking her, allowing Bai Yunyan to breathe a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why haven’t you fellows left yet?” asked a puzzled Bai Yunyan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No rush. We have a show going on here,” Chen Feng replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s better not to watch this show. I will be staying farther away from here.” After saying that, Bai Yunyan’s figure became like a cloud as it floated upwards. Soon enough, she was already outside the valley.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Extraordinary! Extraordinary!” Chen Feng praised again and again. Flying was very difficult here, even for Chen Feng. Unexpectedly, Bai Yunyan was capable of flying in such a relaxed and beautiful manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is said that Bai Yunyan practices the Flowing Cloud Skysoar Formula. Her cultivation base is the best amongst her peers. In a one-on-one fight, I am no match for her,” Mu Qingfeng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The sect guardian cultivation formula of Flowing Cloud Hall.” Chen Feng nodded. Since the very beginning, he had sensed that there was something extraordinary about Bai Yunyan.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Mo Hong’s face suddenly contorted, both his eyes turning red. His entire body kept shaking. The Yao King was about to break free.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Although it is a Sacred artefact, his cultivation base is insufficient. Looks like the Iron Cage will be forcefully opened soon,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mo Hong is a level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator. With the Sacred-tier Iron Cage in hand, he is practically an invincible character amongst those in the Sky Human stage. A pity, his opponent this time is a Yao King,” Zhang Xuanjin said, gleeful at Mo Hong’s predicament.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fools! Hurry up and send a few fellows over to help me!” Mo Hong shouted, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll help!” A cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace said and a spear stabbed towards the Yao King inside the Iron Cage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“NOOO!!!” Mo Hong screamed in shock. However, it was already too late. The spear penetrated its way into the Iron Cage, causing the Yao King inside to tumble a few times. Surprisingly, a bloody hole had appeared on its invincible body and blood kept flowing out from the wound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Another Sacred artefact!” Chen Feng said, shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You idiot!” Mo Hong bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’re the idiot. I am kindly trying to help you here!” the cultivator from Purple Firmaments Palace retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the Yao King roared and its sturdy body began expanding in size. A furry hand emerged from a circular hole; the very hole that the earlier spear attack had created.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“See this? This is all your fault!” Mo Hong gnashed his teeth and swore.</span></p>
