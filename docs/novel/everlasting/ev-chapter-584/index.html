 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is it actually a Dao artefact? Our Eight Trigrams sword array was set up using eight grade 1 Sacred-tier swords, allowing its power to double. Even a Human Immortal would be trapped inside. And yet, this kid could utilize the bead to come out. The way I see it, it must be at least a top-grade Sacred artefact.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t think so. I believe that’s a Dao artefact.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hah, forget Dao artefacts. Even if you tell me that’s an Immortal artefact, I would believe it to be true. Do not forget that Heavenly Sword Faction had obtained many broken Dao artefacts and Immortal artefacts. If they are given another eight to ten years, they will be able to press our Heartless Heaven Sect down.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Who knows just what kind of crazy luck that Heavenly Sword Faction has? To think that they would be able to find such a place. Even if it’s a broken Dao artefact, with enough of them, our Heartless Heaven Sect will be in danger. Thankfully, we managed to discover this in advance. We have successfully joined forces with the other sects to suppress Heavenly Sword Faction. When the time comes, our forces will be able to enter the ancient battlefield of Immortal Humans. Hopefully, we will be able to come across some great fortune there. If I can obtain a broken Immortal artefact and refine it, there will be hope for me to ascend to the Immortal Plane.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The ancient battlefield of Immortal Humans!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough with that. Let’s hurry up and deal with this kid.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This kid has a Dao artefact. He will be very hard to handle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So what? Can he unleash its full power? So many of us are waiting in ambush right here. Can we not handle one kid? After we capture him, that Dao artefact will be ours.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll lead some men over. The kid is heading towards Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The restrictive arrays around Chen Feng kept bursting apart. However, the surrounding restrictive arrays had begun attacking him, causing the rate at which he was advancing to slow down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Invisible forces swept forward from every direction to press Chen Feng. Most of the restrictive arrays were specialized in restraining others. They wanted to capture Chen Feng alive. Even if they could not do so, they must at least slow him down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There are so many restrictive arrays here. I wonder how much effort the other party poured into this. If it weren’t for the Blood Mustering Bead as a means of protection, I would have to slowly crawl my way through the mountains</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought, the sword in his hand flashing forward. A crescent sword beam spun forward. With each spin, countless restrictive arrays would burst apart and a long passageway appeared before Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The rate at which Chen Feng was advancing abruptly rose and Chen Feng made his way through a mountain in just one breath’s worth of time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you cannot pass. Stop!” Several cultivators suddenly appeared before Chen Feng. One of them stabbed forward with a spear – shaped like a coiling dragon – at Chen Feng. Next, tens of thousands of sharp energy streams flew out, transforming into countless ribbons to attack Chen Feng. Likewise, the group of cultivators behind the attacking cultivator attacked as well, displaying various types of attacks. However, all of them chose to unleash ranged attacks against Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of them were practicing caution. They had already determined that Chen Feng possessed a Dao artefact. Thus, they chose not to move forward and risk death. In such a situation, using long-ranged attacks was the best. Naturally, it would be even better if they could borrow the power of the restrictive arrays to trap Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh, how troublesome!” said Chen Feng, who chose to fly upwards instead. The Blood Mustering Bead hovered above his head, continuing to radiate the red-coloured halo of light to open a way for him. Meanwhile, the sword in Chen Feng’s hand kept swinging to break the incoming attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng easily made his way through the mountains. When he landed again, he glanced around and saw a group of cultivators fighting over 50 kilometres in the distance. Sword beams were criss-crossing in the sky as magic treasures flew about. There were also constant shouts coming from there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! Since meeting these two, I have not had a moment’s peace.” Chen Feng shook his head and prepared to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One cultivator after another emerged from the ground to surround Chen Feng. Giving them a glance, Chen Feng could see that they were positioning themselves according to the layout of a certain magic array. Their powers moved to fuse with each other. With each passing moment, the power of the magic array grew increasingly strong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Friend, hold. You are not someone from Heavenly Sword Faction, right?” the spear-wielding cultivator suddenly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! It doesn’t matter who I am. You fellows tampered with the teleportation array and sent me here and even set up a sword array to target me. What do you have to say?” Chen Feng knew that they were trying to buy time. Coincidentally, he also wanted to buy time. Firstly, he needed to recover his strength. Secondly, he wanted to gather his strength to unleash a blitz attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although we had wronged you first, you have already killed four of our men and taken away four Sacred artefacts. No matter how you look at it, that is too much of you,” the spear-wielding cultivator said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is that so? I have a suggestion,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do say.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hand over the other four cultivators who attacked me earlier. After I have collected enough swords, I can forget about what happened today,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a death wish!” The spear-wielding cultivator’s face contorted. Even the other cultivators ended up shouting. This action by Chen Feng was too much.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why all this nonsense? Are you fellows not done with your preparations yet? If you are not attacking, I won’t hold back,” Chen Feng said, the Blood Mustering Bead above his head abruptly flying forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! Be careful! It’s the Dao artefact!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When the spear-wielding cultivator and the others saw Chen Feng attack with the Dao artefact from the get go, they all fell into a state of panic. All of them ducked to the side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Storm of Sword Beams!” Chen Feng shouted and sword beams surged forward like tidal waves to attack the cultivators. Ignoring the result of his attack, Chen Feng then grabbed the Blood Mustering Bead and rapidly rushed forward, his figure transforming into a stream of light as he disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of the cultivators there had livid expressions on their faces. Chen Feng had not actually used the Dao artefact to attack them. Rather, he had only tossed it forward for show. Naturally, the Storm of Sword Beams move that Chen Feng unleashed was real. However, despite its great power, it mostly served to disperse them. Some cultivators, however, did suffer from some minor injuries.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng disappear in the blink of an eye, all of them revealed shameful expressions. Next, they swore and went after Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! You only want to chase me now? Too late!” Chen Feng said with a snicker. He dashed forward. Already, he could see Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling’s figures. Seeing them safe and sound, Chen Feng breathed a sigh of relief. Even so, he did not slow down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Little sister, hold on just a little longer! Chen Feng is already on his way!” Jian Qingwu was sweating all over and the streams of sword energy around her were wavering slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! We’re really unlucky this time around, always encountering danger wherever we go. In the end, we still need Chen Feng to rescue us.” Jian Qingling was feeling rather vexed. She and her sister were exalted geniuses, after all. Back in the sect, they were characters that others would look upon with admiration. They possessed astonishing cultivation talents and the Sword Spirit Constitutions. Later, they were even accepted into Absolute Academy, elevating their identities by another notch. When had they ever suffered such a huge setback? And yet, since the day Zhan Qingsong and his men besieged them, nothing had ever gone right for them. If it weren’t for Chen Feng’s assistance, they would have been incapable of even escaping from the teleportation array.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Chen Feng was about to reach Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling, a massive palm silhouette suddenly descended, grasping at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The palm silhouette was at least 100 zhang wide. The lines and joints on the palm silhouette could clearly be seen. Light spun across the surface of the thick palm and energy streams surged. It was as though a Heavenly God from the Immortal Plane had unleashed this palm. The surrounding clouds were evaporated by the appearance of the palm silhouette. Even so, the sky above remained a blur and there was no way to tell how the sky looked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Human Immortal! A Human Immortal has finally taken action.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s heart gave a thump. Judging by the atmosphere of coercion coming from the palm silhouette, Chen Feng could easily determine that this was an attack from a Human Immortal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Not only is there a sword array set up using Sacred artefacts, there is even a Human Immortal lurking around. No wonder Heavenly Sword Faction failed to get news of what happened. If the subordinate cities of Heavenly Sword Faction end up getting taken down, even if it’s only a few medium-sized cities, Heavenly Sword Faction could be forced to compromise</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, no! A Human Immortal is attacking!” Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling saw what happened. They could not stop themselves from falling into a state of despair. Although their cultivation bases were extraordinary, they had no confidence in taking on a Human Immortal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Bullying the weak? You call this a skill?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng sneered inwardly. Next, he sent the Blood Mustering Bead charging up above his head. The Blood Mustering Bead spun slowly to emanate a sky-charging blood energy to utterly block the majestic atmosphere of the palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It really is a Dao artefact!” A shocked voice came from above. Next, the massive palm silhouette expanded even further and energy streams surged as it grasped at the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Today is my lucky day. This Dao artefact is mine.” The palm silhouette finally grasped the Blood Mustering Bead firmly in its grip. At the same time, it also exerted a power into it, wanting to erase the seals within the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You already know it’s a Dao artefact. You think you can take it away?” Chen Feng revealed a scornful smile. With a thought, the Blood Mustering Bead abruptly released an eye-piercing red light. A series of “chi chi” sounds rang out and the palm silhouette holding the Blood Mustering Bead began corroding away. In less than half a breath’s worth of time, the Blood Mustering Bead had utterly corroded the palm silhouette. The energy essence of the palm silhouette, which was in the process of dispersing, was sucked into the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Blood Mustering Bead flew high into the sky and rapidly expanded in size. Then, it descended like a falling sun, circular waves of bloody light spreading into its surroundings. The surrounding clouds, even those that were far away, became blood-red in colour and countless droplets of bloody water rained down upon the ground. Everything in its path would be corroded. Even the small mountains on the ground and the lands were corroded, deep holes appearing over their surfaces. Some of the cultivators there failed to dodge in time and were struck by the bloody water droplets. Their protective clothes were all corroded away. Even their skins were corroded as well. For those with lesser cultivation bases, one drop was all it took to reduce them into bones. Rather, even their bones would be corroded away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible! This is quite the horrifying move.” Chen Feng beckoned with his hand to quickly collect the Blood Mustering Bead. However, his heart was aching somewhat. Who knows just how many cultivators’ blood essence the Blood Mustering Bead would have to absorb and refine in order to come up with that much power of blood?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng swiftly rushed forward. Seeing Chen Feng charging towards them, the cultivators who were fighting Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling immediately grew terrified and they fled in panic. They did not even have the courage to turn their heads back. Chen Feng had been able to block even an attack from a Human Immortal. Add the abnormal performance from the Blood Mustering Bead, it was only natural that they would become terrified.</span></p>
