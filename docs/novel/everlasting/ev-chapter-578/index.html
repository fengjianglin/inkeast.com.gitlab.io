 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mobilizing the Blood Mustering Bead, Chen Feng smashed open a pathway and every one of the cultivators standing in his path was blown into pieces. Before the sky-blotting mist of blood could dissipate away, the Blood Mustering Bead moved to absorb them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling had believed that they would have to go through a bloody battle in order to break through. They had even readied themselves for failure in the event that the half-step Human Immortals come out to stop them. Unexpectedly, Chen Feng would bring out such a formidable magic treasure. Everywhere it went, the countless cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect would be killed. Even more surprising was the fact that no notable characters from Heartless Heaven Sect stepped forward to stop them. Forget the half-step Human Immortals, not even those at level 5 of the Sky Human stage or above appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going one here? Why is Heartless Heaven Sect’s defences so weak? Did something happen to Heartless Heaven Sect?” The two sisters looked at each other, looks of disbelief and puzzlement on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The might that the Blood Mustering Bead unleashed grew ever stronger and even those observing from the distant walls of Azuresieve City could see that the sky there had turned blood-red. It was as though a red sun had descended upon the area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a huge commotion! It must be Chen Feng and the two sisters. Hopefully, they will be able to break through. The fate of Azuresieve City will depend on them.” Tie Jian, who was standing upon the walls, sighed as he observed what was happening there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’re out.” Chen Feng, who had been trailing several hundred li behind the Blood Mustering Bead, finally slowed down. He then beckoned with his hand and the massive Blood Mustering Bead rapidly shrank into a fist-sized, blood-coloured bead. It then flew into Chen Feng’s palm, where it kept spinning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We got out just like that?” Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling were still in a state of disbelief. There had been no need for them to fight at all. They had simply followed Chen Feng before safely making it out from the encirclement. It was too unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s actions of breaking through the barriers did not escape the notice of Liu Yuan and the others. However, they had been lured to the barracks earlier. Firstly, there was not enough time for them to rush over. Secondly, they had secretly felt terrified after sensing the formidable aura spreading out from the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The other party charged out from the city. They must be trying to get reinforcements.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Judging by this aura, it is most likely that person. How detestable! Not only did he kill so many of our men, he is even using a demonic artefact to collect their blood essence!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do we do? Should we go stop him?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Forget it. Did you fellows forget how we got wounded in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although the other party managed to break out, it also proved one thing. That person’s cultivation base should not be too high. He is only relying on his formidable magic treasure.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Liu is correct. If that person is strong enough, he would have come after us long ago. Still, the fact that he could break through the barriers means that he has quite a number of cards up his sleeve.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were discussing the issue, four commanders flew through the sky to quickly land before them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is the situation?” Liu Yuan was quick to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s not good. The other party managed to charge out.” The body of each and every one of the commanders there was completely stained with blood. All of them looked terrified.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The other party’s magic treasure is simply too powerful. We lost over 200 men. All of them died without a corpse. Even their blood essence was completely devoured. If we had been slightly slow in evading, we would have died as well,” one of the commanders said, gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Yuan and the others clenched their fists and they all swore as they lost their composure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s strange. When did Heavenly Sword Faction get such a character? Is he not a member of Heavenly Sword Faction?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is that possible? If he is not a member of Heavenly Sword Faction, why would he get involved in this mess?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not necessarily. Maybe he is just a simple heretical cultivator. By the way, how many people managed to break their way through the barrier?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There are also Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling, a total of three people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like this fellow has some relationship with Heavenly Sword Faction. No matter. Them making it out is pointless. Azuresieve City will fall in the next few days. Our sect has already informed me that Liu Hun and the others will be coming over soon,” Liu Yuan said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Liu Hun has exited his cultivation retreat? In that case, destroying Azuresieve City will be a piece of cake!” Everyone there grew delighted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng, what kind of magic treasure is that? How is it so heretical?” Jian Qingling, who was looking at the Blood Mustering Bead in Chen Feng’s palm, could not stop herself from asking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s a demonic artefact,” Chen Feng replied smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It looks like a Dao artefact.” Jian Qingwu suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. This is indeed a Dao artefact. Unfortunately, it is a broken Dao artefact.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dao artefact! You actually possess a Dao artefact?!” Jian Qingling cast an astounded look at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I managed to acquire it by accident. Not to mention, this is a broken treasure. Not even 1 % of its power can be unleashed. There is nothing to fuss about.” Chen Feng smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It may be a broken treasure, but it is still far stronger than Sacred artefacts. If only its full power can be brought to bear, we would be able to save Azuresieve City,” Jian Qingling said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s not that simple. A magic treasure’s power is dependent on its user. Even if this Dao artefact is whole, my magic power would be insufficient to unleash its full power,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. Let’s not talk about that. Right now, we should hurry up and notify our sect. Azuresieve City wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer,” Jian Qingwu said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not say anything else. Since these two had come out as well, he would leave the matter of contacting Heavenly Sword Faction to them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is a city 4,000 kilometres away from here, Clearwind City. It is a subordinate city of our sect. Let’s rush over and use the teleportation array there to return to the sect,” Jian Qingwu said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s good.” Chen Feng said, bringing out his Skysoar Warship. Although Jian Qingling’s Skysoar Warship was more luxurious and comfortable, it had been badly damaged back then. She had not had the chance to repair the warship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s a little crude. I hope you don’t mind.” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is Heavenly Origin Trade Association’s Skysoar Warship. How could you have this?” The two sisters were shocked. Chen Feng became even more mysterious in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng chuckled and he brought out the manager token that he had plundered, flashing it before the two sisters before keeping it again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are a manager of Heavenly Origin Trade Association?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them were shocked. Although this manager rank was not high, it still meant that he was an official member of Heavenly Origin Trade Association. The amount of power Heavenly Origin Trade Association held was very big and it was involved in a wide range of businesses, covering almost the entire Eternal World. Not even a first-rate sect like Heavenly Sword Faction would dare to casually offend it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng nodded, not going further into the details. He then began piloting the Skysoar Warship to fly forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This warship was modified before, right?” Seeing Chen Feng’s unwillingness to speak more about the issue, Jian Qingwu chose not to ask further. Instead, she changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, it was damaged before.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Qingling looked around and said, “Part of it is actually wrapped with Mystic Iron essence. It really does look crude. However, because it is wrapped in Mystic Iron essence, its defence is good. Although Mystic Iron is very common, Mystic Iron essence is very valuable. I say, Chen Feng. You are quite the rich fellow.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I had the spent the past few years getting hunted down. However, I did make use of the opportunity to loot some cities as well. I did get some harvest,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Loot cities? You really are a bad guy. We sisters have never gone to the Northern Plains before. Can you tell us how it’s like in the Northern Plains?” Jian Qingling said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even Jian Qingwu had an anticipatory look on her face as she looked at Chen Feng. Clearly, she was also interested in knowing more about the other regions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Truth be told, I do not know much about the Northern Plains. I have not been part of the world of cultivation for long, after all.” Chen Feng chatted with the two sisters as he piloted the Skysoar Warship.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A distance of 4,000 kilometres was nothing to a Sacred-tier Skysoar Warship. Thus, it did not take long for them to arrive at Clearwind City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As a city, Clearwind City was on the same level as Azuresieve City. Both were under Heavenly Sword Faction’s jurisdiction. At that moment, however, the entire city was enveloped by blood and killing energies. Chen Feng had been capable of sensing it from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Something is amiss,” Chen Feng said, frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is blood in the air. Is Clearwind City under attack as well?” Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling’s faces sank sharply.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng mobilized the Blood Mustering Bead and the blood and killing energies enveloping Clearwind City moved. They moved like a sea of clouds, transforming into strands of bloody light before flowing into the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the blood and killing energies absorbed, Chen Feng said, “Fortunately, it seems not many people have died.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll go check it out!” Jian Qingling had long since grown impatient. Before Chen Feng could keep the Skysoar Warship, she had already charged out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Jian Qingling enter Clearwind City, Jian Qingwu, fearing for her little sister, followed suit. Shaking his head, Chen Feng kept the Skysoar Warship. Then, sword light enveloped his body and he flew forward to hover above Clearwind City. As Chen Feng had already absorbed all the blood and killing energies in Clearwind City, fresh air was in the process of quickly converging upon the city. Chen Feng then utilized his eye technique to get a grasp of everything that was transpiring within Clearwind City.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like it has just gone through a great battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were broken buildings all over the city. Although the situation was not as serious as Azuresieve City, it was obvious that this was the result of a large-scale battle between cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Human figures walked back and forth through the city, cleaning up the debris there. It looked as though they had only just gone through a battle. Chen Feng knitted his brows. He had sensed that there were no Sky Human stage cultivators in the city, not even one. Although there were quite a few Concealed stage cultivators, they were mostly wounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>All of the restrictive arrays around the city have been destroyed. Looks like the other party must have utilized overwhelming force to break through. Those that are strong enough would either get killed, captured or escape. Whatever! Let’s not dwell too much on this. I should head down and check it out first.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shook his head as he planned on flying down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Eh? Something is wrong here! The two sisters have disappeared!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s face abruptly sank and he released his divine sense to quickly search the entire Clearwind City. Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling had disappeared, leaving not even a trace of their aura behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What happened? Looks like there is an ambush here</span></em><span>. Chen Feng grew wary and he activated his Magic Eyes of Darkness. Two dark rays of spiritual light shone from his eyes to scan the city.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Here!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng promptly took action. Waving his hand, he fired out a sphere of lightning, which exploded against the top part of a building.</span></p>
