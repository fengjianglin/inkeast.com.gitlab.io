 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Exploding Sword Beam!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng Swung the sword in his hand furiously and a compressed sword beam erupted outward all of a sudden. The surrounding darkness became like spiderwebs, blown away by the sword move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a flash, Chen Feng dashed out. Next, sword light flashed and two more cultivators were killed. The remaining cultivators were so shocked that they quickly made a run for it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A distant roar shocked the sky and streams of demonic energy surged out. Surprisingly, the Demon King was also surrounded and was in the midst of fighting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng shook his head, not going towards the Demon King. It did not matter to him which side would emerge victorious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Recently, more cultivators have gathered up. Looks like they were not scattered that far away from one another. However, as the days go by, the fights will only grow more intense.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Naturally, they would do well to not provoke me, otherwise I will not go easy on them.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Next, Chen Feng spread his soul power out to probe his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>5 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>50 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>250 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>500 kilometres.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s soul power was incomparably powerful. Despite the restrictions he encountered within this place, spreading his soul power across a radius of several thousand li was still not an issue for him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Soon enough, Chen Feng could sense everything within a 1,500-kilometre radius. There were a few half-step Human Immortals within that area. However, they were incapable of noticing Chen Feng’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Eh, Brother Jian Xiaotian? What is wrong with him?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng noticed Jian Xiaotian, who had a frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Chen Feng flew forward to quickly appear before Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, what happened to you? Where are the others?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng appear all of a sudden, Jian Xiaotian was first taken aback. Next, a delighted look appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry, hurry! Or else, it’ll be too late!” Jian Xiaotian hastily said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” Chen Feng’s face took on a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ll tell you as we go. Our group was ambushed. I was the only one who managed to escape. Senior Brother Wen Shaoxiu and the others are surrounded. Jian Shaolong even made use of some methods to push himself beyond his limits. I do not know how much longer they can hold on,” Jian Xiaotian said as he quickly flew back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tell me which way to go.” Chen Feng quickly moved forward to grab Jian Xiaotian’s shoulder. Next, a blood-red sphere encased the two of them and their movement speed abruptly multiplied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Hopefully, we can make it in time</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought. At the same time, he sent his soul power out to inspect their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s just 500 kilometres ahead!” After some time, Jian Xiaotian shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The battle is already over,” Chen Feng said and a foreboding sensation assailed Jian Xiaotian’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them quickly landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is the place. There are signs of battle all over the place. Did something happen to Senior Brother Wen and the others?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me check it out first.” Chen Feng’s soul power rapidly spread out, reaching a radius of 500 kilometres as he scanned the surrounding area. However, he was unable to discover anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t be anxious. Since we cannot find their bodies, it means that there is the possibility of them making it out,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Make it out? It will be very difficult.” Jian Xiaotian shook his head. The other party was prepared and had set up a trap for them. If it weren’t for the jade talismans his master gave him, he would have been incapable of escaping. Although Wen Shaoxiu and the others were fairly powerful, they could not take on ten men each. Not to mention, every one of the cultivators from the opposing party was a half-step Human Immortal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng flicked his palm and the Thousand Seeker Mirror appeared. After Chen Feng poured his soul power into it, images began playing out on the surface of the mirror.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thousand Seeker Mirror had already levelled up to become a grade 6 Prized artefact. It was only missing a chance to reach grade 7 of the Prized tier. Given Chen Feng’s present cultivation base, the magic treasure was already gradually falling behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Looks like I will have to find some time to fuse some magic treasures together. Their grades are too low.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng pondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The images playing on the surface of the mirror revealed what happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Various streams of formidable energy spilled all over the place. Wen Shaoxiu and the others were facing a siege. Although the images were not clear, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian could still see the wounds on Wen Shaoxiu and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, Jian Shaolong blew himself up and the colossal force behind the explosion killed off several of the enemy cultivators. Even so, it had still failed to destroy the magic array sealing their surrounding space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Jian Shaolong!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the tragic scene caused Jian Xiaotian’s eyes to go red.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A pity, he had already over exhausted himself. If it weren’t for that, his self-destruct move would have been strong enough to break apart the restrictive arrays.” Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Images of more battles played out until only Jian Zhikong and Wen Shaoxiu were left.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wang Xinglong and Ren Tianxing had already fallen. Before their deaths, they had attempted to crush their Teleportation Talismans. As expected, it failed. They could not even take any of the enemy cultivators down with them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing their deaths, Jian Xiaotian’s whole body trembled and killing energy surged out from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, Chen Feng was pondering something else. It was clear that most of the cultivators who were sent in had joined forces to kill the disciples from Heavenly Sword Faction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, this doesn’t look good. It looks like those forces have united to kill off the disciples of Heavenly Sword Faction. What happened to your group is probably happening to the others,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have already considered that. That is why I did not choose to return to the sect. Since it has already happened, going out will not change anything. No matter how powerful our sect may be, it cannot start a war against so many forces.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the two of them were discussing the matter, something happened to the battle playing within the mirror. Just as Wen Shaoxiu and Jian Zhikong were about to be killed, a dazzling light suddenly flared out from Wen Shaoxiu’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The light enveloped Wen Shaoxiu and Jian Zhikong before breaking space. Following a few flashes of light, the two of them disappeared. By the time the other party recollected themselves, they were no longer capable of sensing Wen Shaoxiu and Jian Zhikong’s whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, it would appear that Wen Shaoxiu and Jian Zhikong were able to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>That light must be from the Immortal artefact fragment on Brother Wen. He was able to make it out from this calamity alive. He should be safe now, right?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng considered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That way. Let’s go!” Keeping the Thousand Seeker Mirror, Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian quickly pursued them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“With the Immortal artefact fragment as a means of protection, they should be fine. Hopefully, we’ll be able to find them quick. I don’t think the two of them will choose to teleport out,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, I want to request something of you,” Jian Xiaotian suddenly said, gnashing his teeth as he did.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. There is no need for you to say anything else. I know what you want to say. Since coming in here, I have already killed many cultivators from the various sects and families. Killing some more makes no difference to me,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thank you!” Jian Xiaotian said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! No need for formalities between us. Besides, I am also an honorary elder of Heavenly Sword Faction. The way I see it, if I encounter them, even if I don’t attack them, they will not let me go either.” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In just one breath’s worth of time, the two of them had flown past 1,500 kilometres, making their way out from the grassland. However, they were still incapable of finding Wen Shaoxiu and Jian Zhikong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like we’ll have to find some cultivators and ask them about it.” Although Chen Feng’s soul power was capable of scanning up to a radius of several thousand li, he could not constantly utilize his soul power to do that. Doing that would consume too much power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Moving away from Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, chaos had broken out in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Several disciples from Heavenly Sword Faction, their bodies stained with blood, were teleported out. Their appearance instantly shocked the Human Immortals from Heavenly Sword Faction.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” one of the Human Immortals from Heavenly Sword Faction asked solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the assistance from Human Immortals, the wounded disciples were able to quickly recover from their wounds. However, they all cast vengeful gazes filled with killing intent at the Human Immortals of the other sects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Amongst all the cultivators who entered the Ancient Battlefield of Immortal Humans, about 80% of the cultivators from the other sects and families have joined up to kill off the disciples from our sect. Our junior brothers, Hai Hun, Ming Po and Tie Yuan were killed by them. As for the other disciples, I believe they must have encountered the same situation,” one of them said, gnashing his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Such a thing is happening? Damn it!” Hearing that, all the Human Immortals from Heavenly Sword Faction grew enraged. Several of them, the most ill-tempered amongst the bunch, wanted to attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Those who could qualify to enter the ancient battlefield were all the most outstanding elites of the disciples of Heavenly Sword Faction. Every death was a loss. That was especially so of Hai Hun, Ming Po, and Tie Yuan. They were geniuses amongst geniuses who were already close to reaching the Human Immortal stage. If they had died while out on an adventure, the Human Immortals would have been able to accept it. However, the fact that they were killed by other cultivators was a different matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hai Hun is my apprentice. If he were killed in a one-on-one fight, I will have nothing to say, but now? Heh! I want to kill a few Human Immortals to vent this rage!” One of the Human Immortals flew up. His sword intent surged skywards as streams of sword energy swelled out around his mighty stature. He appeared to be on the verge of attacking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His name was Immortal Bluewater. And yet, despite his gentle-sounding name, he was a hot-headed character. As Hai Hun’s master, he was the first to lose his temper.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Immortal Bluewater was about to attack, however, a formidable power suddenly arrived. Immortal Bluewater’s figure shook and he immediately descended to the ground. As he was about to throw a fit, he saw that it was Immortal Steelstone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Steelstone, what are you doing here?” Immortal Bluewater said with a dissatisfied tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Guys, don’t do anything!” Immortal Steelstone grunted, his voice containing strands of soul-shaking power. Due to that, everyone there felt their rage subsiding somewhat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right. We cannot attack. Do not forget what happened earlier. If we attack now, we will be ridiculed by them. Additionally, our sect is not strong enough to take on all the sects,” said Immortal Wavebreaker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Previously, when the wounded cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect and Divine Demon Grotto were teleported out, the sects had wanted to start entering only for the Human Immortals from Heavenly Sword Faction to firmly rebuff them. If they were to throw a fit now, they would only be slapping themselves in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although the number of disciples we sent in is high, they would still be incapable of stopping the combined forces of so many cultivators. All of them are the hopes and future of our sect. Every death is an unbearable loss!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The commotion within the ranks of the Human Immortals from Heavenly Sword Faction did not escape the notice of the other forces. Those on the side of Heartless Heaven Sect and Divine Demon Grotto revealed smug smiles.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This time, Heavenly Sword Faction will be suffering from a huge loss. Ha ha!”</span></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Human Immortals there laughed out. They did not care about how those from Heavenly Sword Faction would react. They were all sects on the same level. In a one-on-one fight, they were fearful of Heavenly Sword Faction.
