 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two stone steles pressed down against the broken sword at the same time and the broken sword’s violent atmosphere of might gradually lessened. Although it was still firing out sword beams without respite, it would appear that Tower already had the situation under control.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not enough, still not enough! More power is needed to refine this Immortal artefact! You guys, don’t slack off! Push out every drop of power you have! After I have refined this Immortal artefact, you fellows will be sure to receive the benefits!” Tower shouted at the nine yaos and demons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The nine yaos and demons went all out. They roared, channelling even more power out and every stream of the yao and demonic energies was like a river. Naturally, they were aware of the benefits of refining an Immortal artefact. Thus, none of them slacked off. They all wanted to savour the benefits that would come along with success.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mysterious-looking symbols suddenly lit up upon the floor. Next, a massive palm silhouette appeared and its five fingers encased the broken sword, forming a cage around it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Longevity Chains kept shooting out from the tip of the five fingers to tie up the broken sword and they began absorbing the broken sword’s energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the technique that Tower was using was none other than the Heavengulping Absorption Technique. However, this was over 10,000 times stronger compared to what Chen Feng could accomplish.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The broken sword wailed. A vast amount of its power was in the process of draining away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Tower suddenly shook. A formidable void storm, mixed with the will of the world, had struck it. As Tower had been focusing wholeheartedly on refining the broken sword, a great deal of the void storm’s power ended up surging into the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Woah! Woah!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The 100,000 great arrays were affected and the nine yaos and demons puked blood as their bodies were flung backwards. Even Chen Feng was sent tumbling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, will you be able to do it or not? My herbal field is devastated again!” Ignoring the wounds on his body, Chen Feng shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! To think that I cannot even handle a minor broken sword. Damn it! I will recover my powers! I will return to stand upon the apex of this universe!!!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity energy, come out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower roared and a stream of faint-cyan energy suddenly appeared. Instantly, the will of the world and the void storm inside subsided. It was just a faint atmosphere of power. And yet, even the nine yaos and demons that had only just gotten to their feet ended up trembling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was not out of fear. Rather, it was a sense of oppression coming from the depths of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What kind of energy is this? Just the atmosphere of power from it could immobilize us, giving birth to the notion that this is an unopposable existence!&nbsp;</span></em><span>The Divine Phantom Mink thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Divine Phantom Mink was a peak-level Yao King, after all. Strength wise, he was already infinitely close to the Earthen Immortal stage. He would normally establish a link with the Immortal Plane to absorb immortal energy for his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the Divine Phantom Mink was terrified to find out that the immortal energy that he had absorbed in the past could not even compare with 0.001% of this energy stream.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the Divine Phantom Mink’s heart burned with passion. If he could absorb an energy stream of this level, even if only a strand, the chances of him reaching the Yao Immortal stage would rise. If he could refine and absorb all of it, his rise to the Yao Immortal stage would be a sure thing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was not just the Divine Phantom Mink. Even the eight Demon Kings were watching with enraptured eyes. Naturally, all they could do was watch as the energy stream surged towards the two stone steles.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two stone steles rumbled violently like two erupting volcanoes and halo after halo of light charged out to blast the broken sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Instantly, cracks appeared across the broken sword, which continued to fight back. Even the bloodstains on the surface of the broken sword were flowing, becoming like dancing flames.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower stretched his hand out and performed a grasping motion. Next, the blood on the surface of the broken sword converged to quickly form a ball of blood that was smaller than a fist.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, hurry up and bring out the Blood Mustering Bead!” Tower shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Coming!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the Blood Mustering Bead appeared on his palm, spinning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is the blood of true Immortal Humans. Hey, hey! This will be enough to restore this Dao artefact.” Tower waved his hand and the ball of blood became like a beam of blood-coloured light as it shot into the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s body shook and he was quickly able to sense the amazing transformation happening to the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When the ball of blood fell into the bloody pool inside, the bloody pool instantly released a bellowing sound as its bloody waters roiled outwards. In just one breath’s worth of time, the size of the bloody pool inside the Blood Mustering Bead had increased tenfold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Woah! Woah!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Bloody Nethertree inside the Blood Mustering Bead began growing at a furious pace as well. It was as though time had been increased for it and countless Bloody Netherflowers bloomed across its branches. Next, one Bloody Netherfruit after another grew from them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng! Weng! Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One blood-coloured halo of light after another radiated out from the Blood Mustering Bead to envelop Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After another breath’s worth of time, the broken Dao artefact became completely restored. However, its power continued to rise, seemingly desirous of rising to greater heights.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Incredible! It is able to recover so quickly! As expected of the blood from Immortal Humans. However, I wonder what level the Immortal Humans were at?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the Blood Mustering Bead abruptly slipped back into Chen Feng’s body and entered his Blood acupoint.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Urgh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grunted. A world-shaking change was happening to his Blood acupoint.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was rapidly expanding. Soon enough, it had grown to over ten times its normal size. It was already comparable to a small spatial pouch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The energy inside the Blood acupoint roiled and it kept surging out to resonate with Chen Feng’s blood. The Blood Mustering Bead kept spinning and the energy it released refined Chen Feng’s blood essence without respite.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng endured, gritting his teeth so as to avoid screaming out in pain. Blood vessels bulged out from the surface of his skin, looking like agile snakes roaming about.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For Chen Feng, it felt as though there were flames coursing through his blood vessels. It was even more unbearable compared to a blood exchange.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was focused on his own cultivation, Tower gave a shout and another stream of longevity energy descended.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two stone steles shone brightly and every rune on their surface radiated with light. Every one of the magic arrays there was capable of tearing space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, the broken sword that had existed for who knows how many years finally blew up, its countless fragments scattering all over the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Great Longevity Furnace, refine them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave from Tower, all of the fragments and essence energy were collected. At the same time, a colossal furnace appeared within the Longevity Tower. The furnace seemed identical to the Longevity Furnace that Chen Feng had condensed out in the past. However, this furnace that Tower condensed out was bigger and more overbearing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Woah! Woah!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of the fragments fell into the Great Longevity Furnace. Next, Tower waved his hand again to send his own Lifebound Flame into the furnace as he began refining the fragments.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the fragments began melting, vast amounts of energy began spraying out, but all of them were devoured by the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Step by step, the Longevity Tower’s power began rising.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower then flicked his fingers and strands of longevity energy flew forward before moving into the bodies of the Divine Phantom Mink and the other Demon Kings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of them felt the wounds on their bodies recovering at a rapid rate. Shocked, they could not stop themselves from roaring out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>There isn’t much longevity energy left. A pity, otherwise these little guys would be able to quickly rise up to the Earthen Immortal stage. Still, the fact that they can cultivate here is already a blessing for them. How far they can go in the future will depend on their luck</span></em><span>, Tower thought as he regarded the nine yaos and demons who were now focused on cultivating themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng spent 1,000 days on his cultivation session. However, only one day had passed in the outside world. If it weren’t for the fact that Tower had stopped manipulating the laws of time, Chen Feng would probably continue with his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! Not even half of the tens of millions of spirit stones here are left.” Chen Feng shook his head, a wry smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To Chen Feng’s relief, however, not all of them were gone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the state of his body, Chen Feng them smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The powers from the sword intent, void storm and will of the world. Chen Feng had more or less refined them all and whatever remained of those powers were stored up inside his body. However, the Fountain of Life’s waters that he stored inside his First Origin acupoint had been used up. All of them had been used to heal his fleshly body and restore his soul power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His sea of wisdom had grown five times bigger than before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His Lifebound Flame had grown ten times bigger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His soul power had also grown ten times stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In the past, my soul power could spread to a radius of 1,000 kilometres. Now, however, it can reach over 10,000 kilometres.” Chen Feng sensed about and found that his soul power had grown so powerful that he could barely control it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>My cultivation base is rising too quickly. The amount of power inside me is high, but I am incapable of fully grasping it. I will need to slowly hone myself.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grasped and the Star Rune Sword appeared in his grip. Next, he swung it down against his arm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A gentle ringing sound could be heard and not a single mark was left on his arm. It was completely impervious to the attack from the Star Rune Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Star Rune Sword was already a grade 2 Sacred artefact. Although not all of its power was unleashed in the earlier attack, it would have no problems cleaving apart a 1,000-zhang-tall mountain. And yet, it could not even leave a cut on Chen Feng’s skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>My fleshly body is at least five times stronger. This is all due to the Blood Mustering Bead. With this, the body armour I am wearing will no longer be as useful.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The body armour that Chen Feng was wearing was only a grade 1 Sacred artefact. Its defensive power was no longer a match for the defensive power of Chen Feng’s fleshly body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s figure then flashed as he left the Longevity Tower. His cultivation session had ended. Tower and the yaos and demons, however, were still in the midst of cultivating themselves. It would seem that their cultivation would take quite some time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Given how strong I am right now, I should be able to easily kill off even a normal Human Immortal, right?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered. Next, he made a gentle stamp, causing the ground to quake and soil to churn. Cracks appeared, spreading outwards into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng unleashed a punch against the ground, blasting a circular hole into existence. Following that, a pillar of water sprayed out. The hole that Chen Feng created with his punch had actually went all the way down to an underground river.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>In the past, my body could unleash a full force of 40 million kilogrammes. At present, it has exceeded 100 million kilogrammes!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng tightened his fist and a thunderous sound rang out from it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His soul power then surged, seemingly enveloping the world as it spread out into the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>5 kilometres, 50 kilometres, 500 kilometres…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, he quickly retracted it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I wonder where Brother Jian Xiaotian and the others have gone to?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Considering that, Chen Feng then leapt up into the sky and he flew forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, after covering a distance of over 50 kilometres, Chen Feng moved to land once again. At the same time, two snake-like lightning attacks aimed at Chen Feng descended from the sky.</span></p>
