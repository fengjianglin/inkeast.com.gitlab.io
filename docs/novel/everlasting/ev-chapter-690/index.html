 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators swiftly made their way into the teleportation portal. Upon entering, they disappeared instantly. Seeing that, the other cultivators grew more desperate. Not to mention, the number of fish monsters was increasing. Rather, some were already attacking the cultivators. Thus, the cultivators began squeezing and fighting each other in their attempt to get into the portal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scram! I’ll go in first!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You scram! Do you have a death wish?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Make way!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You wanna die?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to enter the small portal, the hundred plus cultivators there began fighting one another. In just one breath’s worth of time, several cultivators had been either killed or blasted into the lake, where the fish monsters would eat them up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The fish monsters within the lake finally began attacking for real. Their mouths wide open, they fired out a high number of water arrows into the milling crowd of cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not rush forward to squeeze his way into the portal like the other cultivators. Instead, he stood still, not moving at all. In the face of the fish monsters’ attacks, Chen Feng merely defended himself passively. He did not counter attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, hurry!” Seeing Chen Feng standing still, Jian Xiaotian and Wen Shaoxiu, who were already rushing into the portal, shouted anxiously at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You fellows go first. I will follow you soon!” Chen Feng waved them off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian and Wen Shaoxiu disappeared into the portal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Die!” Suddenly, a chilling light appeared before Chen Feng’s figure. Someone was actually making use of the chaos to attack him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grasped and a black-coloured steel needle was caught in his grip. Although it was already caught, the needle kept vibrating and a stream of peculiar energy emerged from the steel needle, flowing through Chen Feng’s hand to quickly attack his sea of wisdom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Eh, a soul attack? This is actually a Sacred artefact!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was surprised. His own soul power surged forward to shatter the soul attack. At the same time, a lightning power burst out from his hand to erase the seals within the steel needle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This flying needle is pretty good. I can fuse it with the Meridian Sealing Needle,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of popping sounds rang out and a cultivator within the crowd grunted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You must be tired of living.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and the Death Sword flew out. With a swift spin from the sword, the cultivator was cleaved into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After killing off the cultivator, the Death Sword did not return. Instead, it suddenly grew bigger. Sword luminescence flared and it flew back and forth through the crowd of cultivators. Next, a stretch of cultivators fell down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? That’s a high-grade Sacred artefact!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The might displayed by the Death Sword struck fear into the hearts of the cultivators. Those cultivators had been planning to swarm forward and attack Chen Feng. However, it had become too dangerous. Disregarding the fish monsters, Chen Feng himself was proving to be a difficult character to handle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, we’ll settle this with you later!” Someone threatened. In their opinion, Chen Feng will surely be entering the portal as well. When the time came, they would join forces to kill Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After all of the cultivators had entered the portal, the Death Sword transformed into a stream of light, swirling around Chen Feng ceaselessly to shatter apart all the incoming attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, there was a reason for Chen Feng’s decision to stay behind. After he was the only one left, he finally brought out the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Blood Mustering Bead was already fully restored. Additionally, it had also levelled up to become a mid-grade Dao artefact. That was not all. The Bloody Nethertree within the Blood Mustering Bead was beginning to give rise to spiritual attributes as well. Should its spiritual attributes gain form, it would become the Blood Mustering Bead’s artefact spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It can even corrode Sacred artefacts. I wonder, what about a mid-grade Dao artefact?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng waved his hand and a stream of the lake’s water flew up before flowing into the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, the Blood Mustering Bead remained undamaged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Blood Mustering Bead abruptly expanded in size. Next, it flew forward and a vast amount of water surged out from the lake. The waters and even the fish monsters within them were all sucked into the Blood Mustering Bead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The fish monsters are all at the Yao King stage. Not to mention, the lake waters have some research value as well. They might prove useful in the future,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Blood Mustering Bead was fast and it did not take long for it to absorb all the waters within the lake. By then, the bloody pool was no longer the only pool within the Blood Mustering Bead. Instead, there was another pool there, a malevolent energy pool. The waters were the condensed form of malevolent energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was planning to enter the teleportation portal, his eyes lit up and he flew down to the bottom of the now-empty lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the Blood Mustering Bead absorbed all of the lake’s water, the 100-zhang-deep lake became completely exposed. There at the bottom of the lake was a glossy, black-coloured plant. It appeared to be in a very healthy state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>A black-coloured lotus. Tsk, tsk. This must be a good item.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng circled around the plant a few times as he inspected it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This lotus was as black as ink. Chen Feng had seen some red lotuses before, which contained the power of fire. He had also heard of some yellow-coloured lotuses, which contained the power of earth. There were also the pure-white lotuses. However, this was his first time seeing a black-coloured lotus. Rather, he had never even heard of it before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I wonder, was this black lotus born from the waters of the lake, or was it already here even before the lake was formed? If the latter, then this black lotus is truly extraordinary. Additionally, I am unable to figure out the power contained within this black lotus.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng circled the black lotus for a while. In the end, however, he decided against asking Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower was still in the midst of refining the Immortal artefact to restore the Longevity Tower. Thus, Chen Feng did not want to disturb Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Let’s see if the yao or demons have awakened.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng then turned his attention to the Divine Phantom Mink and the Demon Kings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In order to collect the broken sword, the yaos and demons had exhausted a great deal of their strength. Thus, at that moment, they were secretly recovering within the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Generally speaking, the higher one’s level was, the harder it was to recover after suffering from serious wounds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing them immersed in their recovery processes each, Chen Feng did not want to disturb them. Shaking his head, he decided to collect the black lotus first and figure it out later.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had only just put the black lotus into the Longevity Tower when the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss suddenly opened its eyes. To Chen Feng’s surprise, this demonic beast was the first to fully recover.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s good that you’re awake. Check this out.” Chen Feng pointed at the black lotus.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This!” Unexpectedly, upon seeing the black lotus, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ eyes lit up. Rather, Chen Feng could even feel its breath becoming ragged.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You recognize this plant?” Chen Feng asked smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a Heavenly Yao-Demon Lotus.” The Netherpython of the Nine Abyss took in a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heavenly Yao-Demon Lotus? What is it exactly?” Chen Feng tutted, getting a feel for the name. There were both ‘yao’ and ‘demon’ in its name. That was interesting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Heavenly Yao-Demon Lotus is a spiritual plant containing both yao energy and demonic energy. Both yao beasts and demonic beasts would fight over this lotus. Not to mention, this Heavenly Yao-Demon Lotus already has twelve lotus seeds.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The existence of twelve lotus seeds means that this Heavenly Yao-Demon Lotus is at least 60,000 years old.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“60,000 years!” Chen Feng felt moved. Disregarding its effects, just the age of this lotus was enough to make it extraordinary. Even for the spiritual herbs inside the Longevity Tower, herbs that were over 10,000 years old were far and few in number. He doesn’t even have a single spiritual herb that was over 20,000 years old. For this black lotus to be at least 60,000 years old, it was no longer just a spiritual herb.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Its specific function?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enhance the power of yaos and demons, allowing them to evolve. Additionally, there are no side effects. Every single one of the lotus seeds could increase my power by 1,000 years.” After saying that, the Netherpython of the Nine Abyss’ eyes burned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In other words, these 12 lotus seeds can increase your power by 12,000 years?” Chen Feng asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Theoretically, yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well, then. The Divine Phantom Mink gets two seeds while the rest of you get one seed each. I will take the remaining two seeds.” After saying that, Chen Feng waved his hand and two lotus seeds, resembling black diamonds, flew into his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Quite heavy.” Chen Feng weighed the seeds with his hand. The two black-coloured lotus seeds weighed over 5,000 kilogrammes. That meant that each seed weighed at least 2,500 kilogrammes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heh! It contains a power that has undergone a series of compression. One seed weighs 2,500 kilogrammes. No wonder it could allow yaos and demons to level up. Most cultivators would find it hard to absorb or use them for cultivation. However, this is not a hard thing for me. Though, I wonder if it can allow me to level up?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng cultivated the Longevity Scripture’s Heavengulping Absorption Technique and the Demon Plane’s most powerful Demonic Heavengorging Art. It would not be an exaggeration to say that there were no powers that Chen Feng could not absorb. Naturally, some powers that were of a higher quality would require Chen Feng to increase the level of those two cultivation techniques before he could go about absorbing them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then reached out to grip the black lotus’ stem and leaves, only to find that it was as tough as a Sacred artefact. Without exerting some power, he would be incapable of tearing the lotus.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even after having left the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng was still pondering. <em>If I give all 12 seeds to one of them earlier, that means increasing their power by 12,000 years. I wonder how strong they would become then? Ha ha! Looks like I will need to go search for more worldly spiritual objects if I want my helpers to become even stronger.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng shook his head and gave a wry smile. The most important matter for him at the moment was to rise up to the Human Immortal stage. Thinking too much about it was pointless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The teleportation portal was still there, seemingly awaiting Chen Feng. Dashing forward, Chen Feng then entered the portal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng entered, the portal abruptly disappeared. Finally, the teleportation platform descended to disappear into the ground again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After emerging upon the other side, Chen Feng saw a group of cultivators staring at him. He could clearly sense some killing intent sweeping towards him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what took you so long? We have been waiting for a while now. I thought that you…” Jian Xiaotian walked over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You thought I couldn’t get in?” Chen Feng smiled before turning to look at the cultivators on the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, Chen Feng had killed a high number of cultivators. Thus, seeing Chen Feng appear, these cultivators wanted to exact vengeance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They were in an open space with no end in sight. Even the space around them seemed enveloped by a certain power. Checking around, Chen Feng saw that there was a total of 123 cultivators there, himself included. Seeing all the cultivators gathered there, Chen Feng wondered why they did not leave.</span></p>
