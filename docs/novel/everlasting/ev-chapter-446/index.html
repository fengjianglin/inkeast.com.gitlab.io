 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I didn’t think that Nine Firmaments Palace and Star Assembly Sect would be so forceful. They dare to block even a Sacred-tier Skysoar Warship from Heavenly Origin Trade Association. Looks like they are very determined to capture us.” As a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction from the Central Plains, Jian Xiaotian knew quite a bit about how strong the Heavenly Origin Trade Association was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, the two sides will start fighting one another.” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! I didn’t think that the immortal dao sects from the Northern Plains could be so overbearing. You even dare stop the Sacred artefact of our Heavenly Origin Trade Association? I will be leaving now! I want to see who dares to obstruct my way. All who obstructs my way will die!” The insidious-looking man said, piloting the Skysoar Warship to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The insidious-looking man mobilized the might of the Skysoar Warship and energy streams surged about as it charged forward. Due to that, the scent of scorched air spread out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>If Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were not on board the Skysoar Warship, the insidious-looking man might have allowed them to inspect the ship. At any rate, Nine Firmaments Palace and Star Assembly Sect were not existences he could casually offend. Given the current circumstances, however, even if there were more of them, even if they were to threaten him, the insidious-looking man would not allow Chen Feng’s whereabouts to be exposed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, all he could do was to send the ship charging forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! Hurry, move aside!” Sensing the oppressive atmosphere radiating from the Sacred artefact, the faces of the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace and Star Assembly Sect sank. They dashed to the side as fast as they could. This was a Sacred artefact. Just one collision would certainly end with their deaths.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although they were quick to dash to the side, the might of a Sacred artefact was simply too strong. The shockwaves caused by the Sacred artefact’s movement alone were enough to send them flying. Those few with lesser cultivation bases ended up spraying blood out from their mouths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time the cultivators managed to band together once more, the Skysoar Warship could no longer be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Despicable! They dare look down on our Nine Firmaments Palace? Quick, notify this incident to the sect! Have the sect send out experts to capture them!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior brother, do you think Chen Feng is in the Skysoar Warship?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Regardless if criminal Chen Feng is inside the Skysoar Warship or not, we cannot let this matter slide!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace and Star Assembly Sect were used to occupying exalted positions in their everyday lives. When had they ever experienced such a situation? Left in wretched-looking states, all of them were enraged. They wanted nothing more than to chase after the Skysoar Warship and kill everyone aboard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After charging through the blockade, the Skysoar Warship began slowing down. Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had been able to observe everything that happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, if we are not on this Skysoar Warship, do you think they would have allowed the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace to inspect this ship?” Chen Feng asked with a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian considered the matter for a moment before replying, “Probably not. At any rate, Heavenly Origin Trade Association is not to be casually offended. An ordinary flying-type magic treasure is probably nothing concerning. However, this is a Sacred artefact. A Sacred artefact of Heavenly Origin Trade Association getting stopped and searched? If news of this spreads out, Heavenly Origin Trade Association will suffer from a loss of reputation.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! Not necessarily. Do not forget, we are not in the Central Plains. We are still in the Northern Plains. Additionally, we are in Star Assembly Sect’s territory. The way I see it, if we are not on this ship, Ling Long and the others would likely not do something so forceful.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Even though this is the Starsea Region, a place filled with dangers, I believe that the cultivators from Star Assembly Sect will be catching up to us soon enough,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian were discussing the matter, Ling Long and the other four fellows were also gathered together to discuss the same matter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like we’ll need to speed up. We have offended Nine Firmaments Palace and Star Assembly Sect. The consequences of doing so is very severe,” Ling Long said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph, what are you afraid of? This is Starsea Region. No matter how powerful they may be, they would still be incapable of controlling everything here. Besides, after we capture and hand Chen Feng over to Nine Firmaments Palace, they will be thanking us,” the bald muscleman said nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s not that simple. I think we should hurry up and deal with them. Then, we’ll return and discuss this through,” the middle-aged scholar said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right. If so, let’s speed up. Bring out your spirit stones.” The insidious-looking man made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? It’s moving faster!” Chen Feng was slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Its velocity is double that of its earlier velocity. Judging by its current velocity, we can cover at least 100,000 kilometres in one day. Just what are they planning? Or, are they fearful of Nine Firmaments Palace’s pursuit?” Jian Xiaotian guessed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe then are planning on taking action soon. No worries. Let’s wait and see what happens next. We’ll just watch the show first.” Chen Feng grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ve reached the Starsea Region. We should head down!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are here! Miss Ling Long, it’s time we head down!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Five fellows walked out from various rooms. Like Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, they were swindled into boarding the Skysoar Warship. However, their destination was the Starsea Region.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They shouted a few times. However, there was no response. On the contrary, the Skysoar Warship went even faster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going on here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Things are not looking good!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What are you afraid of? There are so many of us here. Come, I know where that Ling Long chick is hiding at!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The five cultivators continued chatting as they moved towards Ling Long. However, they had not made it too far ahead before their surroundings abruptly transformed. Smoke swirled about, ropes flew all around and flying needles shot out silently towards the five of them. Clearly, those were attacks from a magic array.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As expected, there is something wrong. Attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Formidable auras spread out from all five cultivators. Every one of them was a level 3 Sky Human stage cultivator. The five of them were from the same team. Thus, they possessed a very good level of cooperation. Two were in charge of defence while three were in charge of offence. They responded the very instant they were attacked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those five fellows are going to die.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was able to see all that was transpiring there and he secretly felt sorry for the five fellows. Even if those five fellows were twice as strong, it would be impossible for them to charge out. Do not forget, that was a Sacred artefact. Even though it was only a flying-type magic treasure, it was still not something that the five fellows could resist, not with their cultivation level of level 3 of the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sure enough, after just a few rounds of clashes, the five fellows were completely bound by the ropes. Next, Ling Long and the bald muscleman walked in, smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ling Long, you despicable woman! You were lying to us right from the start!” one of the five fellows shouted furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You can only blame yourselves for being stupid.” Ling Long gave a scornful smile. There was no longer the charming and alluring smile on her face. Instead, a hint of killing intent could be seen there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The faces of the five cultivators were extremely ugly to behold. In the beginning, the five of them had wanted to head to Starsea Region. However, as they were heading there, they were lured by Ling Long’s beauty. Thus, they had gotten aboard the Skysoar Warship. Having gotten caught, they felt both furious and regretful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ling Long beckoned with her hand and the storage-type items on the five of them flew into her hand. After inspecting the items, Ling Long scoffed and said, “So, you are just poor beggars!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To Chen Feng’s surprise, Ling Long did not kill off the five cultivators. She only sealed their cultivation bases and kept them within the Skysoar Warship. It was unknown just what her intentions were.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am curious to know where they are headed.” Realizing that the other party was in no hurry to take action, Chen Feng sat down and cultivated himself with peace of mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for Jian Xiaotian, he observed the outside scenery with great interest, seemingly not feeling worried about any impending crisis.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Half a day later, the Skysoar Warship slowed down. During this time, no other cultivators raised an uproar. It would appear that the others had realized something. Thus, they kept quiet. Only those cultivators who were on good terms with one another continued to chat in secrecy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ve arrived,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The transparent window within the room immediately closed up and they could no longer see what was outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! We must have arrived at their lair. I saw a mountain range earlier,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are finally here. This time’s harvest is quite sizable.” A hint of happiness could be seen within Ling Long’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lakes were not the only things within the Starsea Region. There were also towering mountains. However, the number of mountains was comparatively small. At that moment, the Skysoar Warship was landing within a valley surrounded by 18 mountains.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, the mountains there were neither tall nor mighty. The tallest mountain was only 1,000 metres high while the shortest was around 100 zhang high. However, as the mountains were surrounded by the lakes within the Starsea Region, they appeared more striking and conspicuous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Skysoar Warship abruptly shrank and everyone inside fell to the ground. Thankfully, all of them were cultivators with formidable magic powers. They would not get wounded from the fall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When they landed, they were able to clearly see their surroundings. Mountains surrounded them and there were some concealed buildings within the valley. Of course, that was not the most pressing matter. The most pressing matter was the fact that there were over 100 cultivators surrounding them. The majority of them were cultivators at the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even a fool could see that something was not right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ling Long, what is going on here?” a majestic-looking cultivator sporting a cheek line beard stepped forward and shouted. The blade slung across his back quivered. It would unleash an attack the instant something bad happened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The forces here are very strong. Is this a bandit lair? This is my first time encountering such a powerful group of bandits.” Jian Xiaotian sent a secret vocal transmission to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The bigger the bandit lair, the better. Recently, I have been using a lot of spirit stones. The amount of spirit stones on me is almost exhausted. It’s about time I top it up.” Chen Feng was not feeling too concerned. However, he was feeling curious about the nature of this group.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hold back on taking action first. Let’s watch their performance.” Chen Feng sent another secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally. We’ll observe just what kind of tricks they have up their sleeves.” Seeing Chen Feng’s display of nonchalance, Jian Xiaotian, too, grew calm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha, you fools! Now that it has come to this, do you still not understand what is going on? Hurry up and hand over all your possessions and restrain your own cultivation bases. That way, you will be able to preserve your lives.” The bald muscleman laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Damn it! It’s a bandit lair! Everyone, attack! Kill our way out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right. You won’t have an easy time defeating us!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the exception of Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian, tens of the cultivators from the ship exchanged glances before rapidly preparing to unleash their attacks. However, when they began circulating their primary energies to utilize their magic techniques, some of them instantly sprayed blood out from their mouths. They fell to the ground, incapable of getting up anymore. As for those who did not, their faces too, contorted as they had to endure an acute level of pain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For the cultivators, the pain was not that big of a deal. What was terrifying was the fact that their powers were rapidly diminishing. Even their soul powers had frozen up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We have all been poisoned! Back in the Skysoar Warship, we drank some tea. Ling Long, you put poison in the tea!” one of the cultivators who was able to keep standing shouted angrily as he pointed at Ling Long.</span></p>
