 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you all right?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am fine. However, I feel somewhat dizzy.” Lin Shaokun turned his head about and said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Originally, Jian Xiaotian had also wanted to attack the stone stele. However, after seeing the state Lin Shaokun was in, he immediately decided against it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The three of them stepped forward to surround the stone stele, looks of contemplation in their eyes. None of them dared to attack anymore. After some time, Lin Shaokun exhaled lengthily. Only then did the feelings of discomfort utterly disappear from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It feels somewhat similar to Driftcloud Immortal Mountain,” Chen Feng suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean the Driftcloud Immortal Light!” Jian Xiaotian quickly understood what Chen Feng meant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Whenever someone attacked the Driftcloud Immortal Mountain, the Driftcloud Immortal Light from the mountain would counter attack immediately. The stronger the attack launched against the mountain, the stronger the counter attack would become. However, if no one attacked it, the Driftcloud Immortal Mountain would not do anything at all. This was the behaviour exhibited by the stone stele before them <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It should not be an immortal light. However, I believe it is somewhat similar,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What should we do now?” Jian Xiaotian had already circled the stone stele a few times. Finally, he reached his hand out to stroke the stone stele. As expected, there was no response.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like there is truly something special about Pot Mountain. No matter what, I must find the Pot Brothers,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe they have already left Pot Mountain,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. I have this feeling. I am certain that they did not leave. Something must have happened,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the three of them stayed in Pot Mountain for some time. It did not take them long to go through every part of Pot Mountain. In the end, however, they found nothing. With the exception of the strange stone stele, this was nothing more than an ordinary mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like the issue rests with this stone stele.” The three of them got together and began discussing the issue.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>During this period of time, the three of them had also utilized various techniques on the stone stele. However, they were unable to discover anything. Finally, Jian Xiaotian, who refused to accept it, finally unleashed a punch against the stone stele. The backlash sent him flying and his whole body was paralyzed as a result. Chen Feng and Lin Shaokun had to prop him up in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, do you know what is going on?” Seeing no other options, Chen Feng finally relented and asked Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course,” Tower said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? What is it?” Chen Feng was taken aback. He didn’t think that Tower would know.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s very simple. This Pot Mountain is actually a magic treasure.” Tower’s words shocked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? A magic treasure?!” Chen Feng was so shocked, he accidentally blurted those words out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what did you say?” asked a puzzled Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s nothing. I just thought of something,” Chen Feng replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng continued to secretly communicate with Tower. “You are saying this mountain is a magic treasure?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is not just this mountain. The Driftcloud Immortal Mountain that you entered in the past is also a magic treasure.” Tower gave him another bombshell.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Driftcloud Immortal Mountain is a magic treasure as well? But why didn’t you say anything back then?” Although it sounded unbelievable, Chen Feng decided to trust Tower wholeheartedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Back then, I was not strong enough. Thus, my memories were not restored to a sufficient level. Even if you put some things I should have known in the past before me, I would be incapable of identifying them. However, I have recently recovered some of my memories. That is why I can now detect that this mountain is a magic treasure,” Tower said with an amused tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What artefact tier is this magic treasure at?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s just a broken Immortal artefact,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Immortal? Artefact?” Chen Feng was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. Above the Prized artefact is the Sacred artefact. Above that is the Dao artefact. And above that is the Immortal artefact. This is truly the magic treasure that Immortal Humans use. It is not something that would exist in the mundane world,” Tower said with a pleased tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng considered for a moment before saying, “Tower, aren’t you trying to repair yourself? This is an Immortal artefact right here! It should be of help to you, no?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course, it will be helpful. However, I will need to take my time studying it. Recklessly taking action is probably not a good thing. I will need to see how badly damaged this Immortal artefact is, otherwise the tables might turn against me. When that happens, I’ll be in hot soup,” Tower said happily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng began circling around Pot Mountain, again and again, not showing the slightest hint of impatience as he did. His actions puzzled both Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is up with Brother Chen? Did he discover something?” Jian Xiaotian found it strange.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe,” Lin Shaokun said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As there were no pursuers from Nine Firmaments Palace, the two of them were finally able to relax. Naturally, all three of them knew that this state of tranquillity was only temporary. Given Nine Firmaments Palace’s might, it was just a matter of time before they were found.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After two days, Chen Feng finally stopped moving about. Then, he came to stand before the stone stele again. His pair of eyes stared intently at the stone stele as his hands moved to form one hand seal after another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what are you doing?” Jian Xiaotian felt curious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come stand beside me,” Chen Feng said seriously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun had no idea what was happening, they followed Chen Feng’s instructions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was unknown just how many hand seals Chen Feng formed. Finally, he pushed both hands forcefully to slam against the stone stele.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun simultaneously cried out in shock. They did not understand why Chen Feng did that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>To their surprise, when Chen Feng’s palms struck the stone stele, only a faint light shone out from the stone stele. There was none of the formidable backlash that they had experienced back then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Nothing happened? What is going on?” Jian Xiaotian grew curious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had only just said that when the stone stele suddenly lit up. Next, an overpowering suction force enveloped the three of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!” Jian Xiaotian shouted anxiously. He wanted to fight the suction force, but found himself incapable of extricating himself from the formidable and sticky power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Jian, don’t panic,” Chen Feng said calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, light flashed before the eyes of all three and they entered a passageway formed entirely of light.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng’s team of three disappeared, densely-packed symbols began appearing upon the ordinary-looking stone stele. The symbols quickly enveloped the entire stone stele. If an expert happened to be around, he or she would realize that the symbols were characters from a very ancient and hard to decipher language.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the characters had only appeared for a moment before disappearing. Then, the stone stele returned to its normal state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the three of them, before they could clearly inspect the passageway, it suddenly disappeared. When the three of them were finally able to steady themselves, they found that they were standing on the ground while the blue sky was above their heads. A breeze blew towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, where are we?” Jian Xiaotian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Looking straight ahead, the three of them saw endless plains. Looking around, they saw endless rolling mountains.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are inside Pot Mountain,” Chen Feng said, observing their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Inside Pot Mountain? What do you mean?” Jian Xiaotian did not understand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a potent spiritual energy! No, that’s not it. This is not the usual worldly spiritual energy,” Lin Shaokun suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is immortal energy,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Immortal energy? Surely not!” said Jian Xiaotian, who began channelling his cultivation technique to absorb the surrounding streams of energy. Next, a dumbfounded look appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The thickness of the energy here is about the same as the outside world. However, its grade is simply too high! Earlier, I had only circulated my cultivation technique once, but it feels as though I have been cultivating for one whole day outside. When you put it that way, cultivating here for one day is roughly the equivalent of cultivating outside for one year!” Jian Xiaotian said, both shocked and happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It has to be immortal energy.” Although there was a puzzled look on Lin Shaokun’s face, he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, what happened? Did we ascend to the Immortal Plane?” asked a confused Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally, this is not the Immortal Plane. Like I said earlier, we are inside Pot Mountain. This Pot Mountain is no ordinary mountain. Rather, it is the altered form of an Immortal artefact,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Immortal artefact!” Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun turned to look at one another, looks of shock etched on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean to say, we are now inside an Immortal artefact?” Light glinted within Jian Xiaotian’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are inside an Immortal artefact! Immortal artefact! The standard weapon of Immortal Humans! That is not something that a Human Immortal could hope to compete against. No wonder there is immortal energy here. If we can continue absorbing the immortal energy here and cultivate ourselves… tsk, tsk! Just thinking about it makes my heart gallop.” Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun simply inspected their surroundings for a moment before sitting down cross-legged. They began cultivating themselves, ignoring whether or not there were any dangers around them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the two try-hards, Chen Feng could not stop himself from smiling. Indeed, for any cultivator who could arrive here, the first thing to come to mind would be to cultivate. The energy contained within this space was not your average spiritual energy, after all. Rather, it was immortal energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>What was the immortal energy? It was the spiritual energy within the Immortal Plane. To put matters into perspective, say an ordinary human without a shred of cultivation talent was thrown into the Immortal Plane. By cultivating himself at a carefree pace, that piece of trash in the mundane world can easily reach the Human Immortal stage! In comparison, there were many peerless talents within the mundane world who would strive their whole lives only to fail to reach the Human Immortal stage. This was the difference between the two energies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, how do you feel?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not bad. I’ll head out and check things out for a bit. You should take this opportunity to cultivate yourself,” Tower said. Next, a stream of light flew out from Chen Feng’s glabella before quickly disappearing into the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng shook his head. He knew that Tower must have figured something out. Thus, he did not say anything else and simply floated upwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He continued flying upwards, only stopping after reaching an altitude of 1,000 metres. There, he hovered silently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>As expected, the laws here are different compared to the outside world. However, the suppressive effects are not as strong as I had imagined. This is indeed a good place to cultivate. If I can keep on cultivating here, it will be good. Surely, Nine Firmaments Palace will not be able to track us all the way here. Even if they can find Pot Mountain, they will be incapable of entering</span></em><span>. Having reached that line of thought, Chen Feng could not stop himself from smiling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>If it were not for Tower’s assistance, Chen Feng would have been incapable of entering. He could only helplessly stay outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After considering that, Chen Feng felt the pressure on him lightening considerably. Thus, his figure slowly descended. After reaching the ground, he followed Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun, sitting down cross-legged to cultivate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When he was up in the sky earlier, Chen Feng had already checked their surroundings. Everything within a radius of over 50 kilometres was normal. There was not a hint of danger. Thus, Chen Feng could rest easy and focus on his cultivation efforts.</span></p>
