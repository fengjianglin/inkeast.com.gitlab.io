 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Just because they are called the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects, do they really fancy themselves as exalted existences. Our Demon Order also has Human Immortals! What’s the big deal?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That’s right. If we have to compare, our Myriad Heresy Sect is in no way inferior to any of these so-called Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, stop quarrelling. Nine Firmaments Palace has united with the other Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. Their power is indeed at a level where we cannot hope to match. We should observe the situation first. Perhaps they will be incapable of opening the entrance.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I hope they cannot open the entrance, otherwise they will have an excuse to drive us away.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ten Human Immortals mobilized ten Sacred artefacts as they surrounded the Sky Meteorite. Ten formidable powers erupted to immediately trigger a sudden storm. The world itself shook as an overpowering aura punched its way over 50 kilometres into the sky. Even the seemingly invincible strong winds up there were blown away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hurry up and back away!” The surrounding cultivators, sensing the shockwaves spreading outwards, swiftly backed far away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After considering it for a moment, Chen Feng too, moved away from the Sky Meteorite. Although he could ignore the shockwaves by utilizing the Longevity Tower’s power, Chen Feng did not want to expose his trump card so quickly. If these people were to discover that he possessed a Heaven-defying magic treasure, they would probably want to probe into the matter. The Human Immortals here were simply too strong. Add their Sacred artefacts into the equation, Chen Feng did not believe that the Longevity Tower could sweep them all away. Rather, if the Longevity Tower possessed such an ability, Chen Feng would not have needed to run away. He could have simply killed his way towards Nine Firmaments Palace and flatten it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The ten Sacred artefacts sealed the surrounding space, making it impossible for outsiders to enter.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sensing the power unleashed by the Sacred artefacts, the meteorite reacted by once again releasing a formidable wave of energy. This time, the shockwaves released by the meteorite were even more powerful and violent than before. It was like an exploding star, unleashing a power capable of obliterating the world. The Sacred artefacts had already set up barriers around the meteorite to stop this terrifying power from spreading outwards. Even so, those standing far away had still felt terrified. Reflexively, they backed away some more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword intent, blade intent, spear intent, fist intent, palm intent and storm impressions erupted outwards, clashing non-stop against the magic treasures around them. The clash created images of steel and stones crashing together, of mountains crashing down, of rivers roiling and of the earth toppling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the power erupting from the meteorite was ferocious, the meteorite remained as steady as a mountain, stationary.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, don’t hold back. Hurry up and put all you have into this, otherwise it will be hard for us to open the entrance!” the Human Immortal from Nine Firmaments Palace shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Following his shout, the powers shooting out from the surrounding Sacred artefacts grew even stronger. Finally, they managed to budge the Sky Meteorite, albeit slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good, it’s working! Everyone, continue!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, do you think these fellows can succeed?” Chen Feng was currently over 50 kilometres away from the meteorite. Naturally, he was still capable of clearly observing what was happening to the Sky Meteorite.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very difficult,” Tower slowly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, with this, my opportunity has come. If these fellows can work even harder, I might be able to collect this meteorite.” Tower suddenly snickered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you not afraid that others might be able to collect the meteorite?” Chen Feng was still feeling concerned. At any rate, this show of power by the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects of the Northern Plains was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. Given their abilities, these people will not be able to take away the meteorite. Even if they can, I can just go snatch it from them,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine. If so, make your preparations. I want this meteorite,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t need you to tell me that. I also want to see what treasures are inside this pocket dimension,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another wave of aura, even more powerful than the previous one, burst out from the meteorite and cracks could be seen in the surrounding space. The Sacred artefacts surrounding the meteorite began trembling and the faces of the Human Immortals wielding the Sacred artefacts turned grim. For some, blood could be seen trickling down the corners of their mouths.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Ha ha, what a show! So many experts are mobilizing so many Sacred artefacts, but they still cannot handle this meteorite.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng could not stop himself from feeling amused.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This meteorite has yet to reveal its true power, otherwise those Human Immortals would have been sent flying long ago, even with the Sacred artefacts in hand,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“When you put it that way, these people would be incapable of opening up the entrance?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Aren’t there still a lot of people who have yet to take action over there?” Tower said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, Chen Feng understood what Tower meant. At that very moment, only ten Human Immortal experts from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were taking action. Chen Feng did not believe that the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects had only sent out a total of ten Human Immortals. Who knows how many more cultivators were hiding inside the flying warships hovering in the sky?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another sky-shocking boom rang out and shockwaves spread out, completely evaporating the surrounding lakes. Even the small mountains nearby, each with a height of over 100 zhang, were flattened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, who was 50 kilometres away from the meteorite, felt as though there were ten plus hurricanes spinning towards him. The cultivators there began channelling their techniques to defend against the shockwaves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible, the power of its backlash is getting even stronger,” Chen Feng said smilingly as he stretched his hand out to shatter the incoming sword beams. At the same time, his figure flew another 100 metres back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After surrounding the Sky Meteorite for one whole hour, the ten Human Immortals knew that their power alone was insufficient. After a brief discussion, the Human Immortal from Nine Firmaments Palace spoke up. “To all the Human Immortals and high-level Sky Human stage experts here, you may now attack the Sky Meteorite!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! They were just driving us out earlier. Now, they want us to help them? What do they take us for?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is this all the immortal dao sects of the Northern Plains can do? How disdainful!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, don’t attack! It would be best for us to just watch this whole thing from afar. Look at them. Each of their Human Immortals are as tired as dead mutts. What a sight for sore eyes!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh, forget it! Let’s attack together to open up the entrance. That way, everyone can benefit from it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the cultivators who were not from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects were feeling dissatisfied, they had still slowly stepped forward. Additionally, most of them had smiles plastered on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Demon Order is willing to attack. We hope that we, too, will be able to enter and explore the pocket dimension after this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Heavenly Spirit Order is also willing to attack!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Holy Flame Sect is in!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Our Myriad Heresy Sect has no objections!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Count our Demon Sound Sect in as well!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We loose cultivators are here to join the liveliness, but we have a few apprentices who want to experience the world!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Everyone was inwardly cursing the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. However, after a few breaths’ worth of time, tens of cultivators stepped forward. Of these cultivators, eight were Human Immortals while the others were level 9 Sky Human stage cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, tens of Human Immortals flew out from the flying warships belonging to the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. Surprisingly, all of them were Human Immortals. Seeing this show of force, all the cultivators watching from afar grew flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Remarkable! As expected from a first-rate large-sized immortal dao sect. Every one of them could casually send out two to three Human Immortals. Too strong! Thankfully, we did not start a conflict earlier. Even with our current numbers, there are still not enough of us to go around for them to slaughter.</span></em><span>&nbsp;The thought flashed through the minds of many of the cultivators present.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I knew there are more Human Immortals around.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng smirked inwardly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Set up the Great Fuselight Commonground Array!” the Human Immortal from Nine Firmaments Palace shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After they had set up the array, Tower responded in shock, “I didn’t think that these few Human Immortals could display such an exquisite magic array. Tsk, tsk! This is a surprise!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It could even surprise you? This magic array must surely be extraordinary,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally. If I am not mistaken, this magic array is a great immortal technique. Additionally, it is a high-grade great immortal technique. However, it is only a fragment of the technique. Not to mention, their cultivation bases are lacking, making it impossible to fully unleash its power. Even so, it is still quite good. Looks like I will be able to save a lot of effort due to this,” Tower said with an amused tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fuselight Commonground Array. This is quite a good name. However, it looks like the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects are cooperating quite well with one another. Clearly, they must already be familiar with this magic array. Strange. Looks like there is a story behind this,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to the magic array and the additional cultivators involved, the immovable meteorite began trembling intensely. Finally, it even began shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“More men!” the Human Immortal from Nine Firmaments Palace shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The flying warships hovering in the sky unleashed streams of light, which struck the great array, causing its power to immediately grow stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They were burning a high number of spirit stones, converted by the Sacred artefacts into pure energy. Simultaneously, the cultivators who had been constantly lurking within the flying warships attacked as well, sending out blast after blast of formidable energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Sacred-tier ships were all roaring as the streams of light they sent out struck the great array. In just a flash, the might of the Fuselight Commonground Array grew several times stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sky boomed and the earth quaked. Finally, the meteorite, which had seemingly fused with the earth, shifted. That slight movement from the meteorite, caused an immeasurably mysterious aura to charge out from beneath it. Even with their eye powers and senses, none of the cultivators present could see how high up the aura was going.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is not an aura of our Eternal World. Is the pocket dimension from outer space as well?” said a shocked cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Who cares about that? Looks like the entrance is about to open up. When the time comes, we must hurry up and charge in. There must surely be treasures inside!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Continue pumping more power into it!” Seeing the meteorite move, all the cultivators there fell into a state of frenzy. As for the Human Immortals from the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects, they began howling in unison.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Sacred artefacts fired out beam after beam of energy with reckless abandon at the great array, increasing the might of the array.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The meteorite continued moving. Although it was moving very slowly, everyone instead worked even harder. In the end, even the Sky Human stage cultivators from the various sects began channelling their powers into it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, what is it?” Suddenly, Chen Feng felt something strange about the Longevity Tower. He could not stop himself from asking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kekekeke! These fellows sure are breaking their backs for this! In the end, however, it will all end up benefiting us!” Tower cackled happily.</span></p>
