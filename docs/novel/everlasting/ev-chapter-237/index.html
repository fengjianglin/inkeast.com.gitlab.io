 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng blocking their path, killing intent simultaneously glinted across both Liu Tian and Xu Ziping’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this, Chen Feng? What do you mean by blocking our path?” Liu Tian asked coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Tie and Senior Sister Shangguan are currently recuperating. They cannot be disturbed. If there is anything, please wait until they have fully recovered,” Chen Feng said coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is precisely because they are injured that I want to go check up on them. We are all from the Northern Plains’ Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects. We should always be helping each other out,” said Liu Tian as he strode forward, ignoring Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knitted his brows. Then, the primary energy within his body surged and astral energy flowed out. With a kick, his figure charged towards Liu Tian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A banging sound rang out and both Chen Feng and Liu Tian were knocked away from each other at the same time. Due to the earlier collision, a crater had appeared on the ground. It proved that the two of them had crashed into each other earlier with a formidable force.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Chen Feng appeared indifferent, he was secretly shocked. In the earlier clash, Chen Feng could feel a suction and holding force from Liu Tian’s body. It nearly made him lose his footing. Thankfully, his body still contained the massive amount of yao power that he had absorbed earlier. He had unleashed that power in the earlier collision. If it were not for that power, that exchange would have caused Chen Feng to suffer quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It seems this is the power of a domain. It is truly mysterious,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was not the only one to feel surprised. Liu Tian was even more shocked. He looked at Chen Feng with shock on his face. That earlier exchange had been a true collision of powers. There was no falsehood in his move at all. Unexpectedly, his level 9 of the Concealed stage cultivation base was unable to suppress a level 4 Concealed stage cultivator. Should news of this spread out, just how big of a tempest would it trigger? Liu Tian’s reputation would plummet as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>How is this fellow’s primary energy so strong? Although it is still no match for me, it is already comparable to a cultivator at the condensed domain power realm. Could he be playing the pig to prey on the tiger? Is he simply not a level 4 Concealed stage cultivator and actually a hidden expert? That is possible, otherwise how could he have refined such a powerful Prized artefact? But what now? Do I continue?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Liu Tian grew uneasy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chen Feng! What are you trying to do?” Liu Tian revealed a furious expression as his whole body pulsed, sending wave after wave of energy streams, which swirled around them. At the same time, a glossy shine, faint-gold in colour, began spreading out from within his body. It quickly formed a strange-looking blade, which hovered before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the magic technique, Chen Feng grew shocked. He did not expect Liu Tian to be practicing a unique weapon condensation technique as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a thought, Chen Feng brought out the Overwhelming Astral Sword, which hovered before him. Swift and forceful sword light radiated out from the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this? Is Junior Brother Chen planning on fighting me?” Liu Tian said coolly. The energy streams swirling around accelerated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As long as you fellows stay honest, I will not attack.” Chen Feng dared not lower his guard. If Liu Tian was the only one there, even if he was no match for Liu Tian, Chen Feng was confident he could hold him down. However, there was still Xu Ziping beside Liu Tian. His existence changed everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you think you are the only one with Prized artefacts?” Xu Ziping sneered. With a wave of his hand, the Lightstream Shield appeared before him. It radiated a stern and thick aura, mountain-like in quality, towards Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Impressive. I had assumed that it is just a flying-type Prized artefact. Unexpectedly, it contains such a formidable earthen power.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng grew even more wary.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? Is the Xu Family of the Central Plains planning on starting a war with our Northern Plains’ immortal dao sects?” Chen Feng began talking nonsense in order to buy time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha! How laughable. Are you an idiot? Who do you think you are? Even if you are the Young Sect Master of an immortal dao sect, no one will know if I kill you here,” Xu Ziping could not stop himself from ridiculing Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, is that so? If so, try it! If it comes down to it, we’ll both be critically wounded. It’s either me or you. If I go all out, I am confident I can kill at least one of you,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, after hearing those words, a trace of hesitation flashed across the eyes of both Liu Tian and Xu Ziping and they did not attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! A mere little fellow at level 4 of the Concealed stage. By joining hands, it will be easy for us to kill him,” Xu Ziping finally said, gritting his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you finally revealing your true faces? You two are determined to kill me,” Chen Feng said with a sneer. The bloody lance in his hand swung about and a thick blood energy dispersed into the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a bloody demonic artefact! I don’t even know how many people it has killed. Fine! Today, I will enact justice on Heaven’s behalf! No matter what, I must not allow a demon like you to harm the world of cultivation!” Liu Tian said with a righteous demeanour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing those words, Chen Feng was almost incapable of even smiling. What an insincere, high-sounding excuse. To think that he could even say something like that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since you two have determined to attack, don’t blame me for being rude.” After saying that, Chen Feng stamped his feet. The ground beneath quaked and roiled violently to form earthen blocks, which shot towards Liu Tian and Xu Ziping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Simultaneously, Longevity Chains rapidly shot out from Chen Feng’s body. They moved together with the earthen blocks to tie up the two of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Since a battle was unavoidable, Chen Feng would take the first shot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Lightstream Shield, break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Xu Ziping shouted and his large shield radiated circular streams of light, which broke through the earthen blocks before charging forward at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Gliding Redmoon Slash!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Tian’s move was spectacular. Like a red-coloured crescent moon descending from the sky, his attack turned and sped towards Chen Feng. The moonlight shining from it was capable of cutting even the surrounding space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Chains that Chen Feng sent out were all cut. Next, the mighty beams of astral energy kept slashing forward, seemingly wanting to cut Chen Feng into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Rampaging Arms!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a wave from Chen Feng, a Longevity Blade and Sword whistled forward. Forming a cross shape, they then collided against Liu Tian’s Gliding Redmoon Slash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, the attack from Xu Ziping had arrived. Due to the formidable and suppressive power of the Lightstream Shield, Chen Feng could feel the ground beneath him sinking. The mighty pressure was such that Chen Feng found it hard to breath.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This fellow is quite capable. No wonder he could work hand in glove with Liu Tian</span></em><span>. Chen Feng sneered. The bloody lance in his hand stabbed forward at lightning-like speed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s see if your shield is more durable or if my lance is sharper,” said Chen Feng icily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kuang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An ear-piercing sound echoed out and Chen Feng had to back away. The bloody lance in his hand vibrated ceaselessly and the vibrating force went all the way into his body. It was extremely hard to bear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Revolving Domain, Earthen Fist!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, an earthen-coloured fist pummelled through the air, creating rumbling sounds as it punched towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng directed the Overwhelming Astral Sword out. In a flash, it slashed the huge fist apart. Immediately after that, however, a huge palm silhouette – formed using domain power – swung towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng had no time to react and the palm slapped his body heavily, causing him to fly far away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s figure slammed heavily into the ground, leaving a human-shaped indentation upon the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That should be it for the guy, right?” Liu Tian knew just how powerful that attack was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, Chen Feng’s body jumped as he swiftly climbed up. Patting away the soil on his body, he appeared undamaged by that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible, the kid’s fleshly body is so strong!” Both Liu Tian and Xu Ziping were shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a beckoning hand, the Overwhelming Astral Sword swiftly returned to his hand. In just one exchange, Chen Feng had been sent flying. He felt an immense amount of pressure. He was simply no match for the two of them. Facing them head on was begging for abuse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you are quite capable,” Liu Tian said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, I would like to see how long you can hold on.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that Chen Feng had no intentions of escaping, the two of them felt more at ease. If Chen Feng were hell-bent on escaping, the two of them would be incapable of stopping him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You two are disciples of infamous sects. To be ganging up on me like this, aren’t you fellows going overboard?” Chen Feng smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Enough nonsense! This kid is trying to buy time. Hurry up and kill him.” Liu Tian and Xu Ziping exchanged glances. Without giving Chen Feng any opportunity to continue speaking, they attacked Chen Feng together.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Fearing that their battle would affect Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun, Chen Feng kept moving their battle far away. Liu Tian and Xu Ziping did not object. At any rate, they were planning on killing Chen Feng first. Once they have dealt with Chen Feng, the wounded Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun would be incapable of fighting back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a moment of fighting, with the two ganging up on him, Chen Feng ended up getting sent flying once more. This attack had wounded Chen Feng even more compared to the first one. It was a fist formed using Liu Tian’s domain power. Chen Feng even heard his bones crack as a result of the attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk, tsk. I’m suffering for trying to help others,” Chen Feng said wryly. Next, he brought out an Invisibility Talisman and pasted it on his body. Immediately, his figure disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Invisibility Talisman!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A minor trick. Watch as I force him out!” Liu Tian sneered. Next, waves of soul power spread out from his sea of wisdom into his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In but one breath’s worth of time, Chen Feng’s figure had re-appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s see where you plan on running to. Take my Soulblade attack!” Liu Tian’s eyes shone and the soul power he radiated rapidly converged. In the blink of an eye, it formed a blade, which then whistled towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Soulblade! This fellow has reached the end of the Concealed stage, he will be breaking through to the Sky Human stage soon!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was greatly shocked. Knowing that he could not dodge, he clenched his teeth and swung Bloody Soul defensively before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng felt his whole body quaking. A gigantic force swept through his body. At the same time, a swift and forceful soul power charged towards his sea of wisdom, desirous of cutting it into two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What a formidable soul power! However, the one that managed to enter my sea of wisdom is just the remnant shockwaves.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s own soul power roared out from within his sea of wisdom and it quickly extinguished the invading soul power.</span></p>
