 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good? Brother Chen, you have to be careful. That is Liu Feifei from the Liu Family. Although she is only at level 2 of the Sky Human stage, her cultivation base is very high. She is no ordinary cultivator. If you are careless, you will be defeated by surprise,” Shui Yan said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng nodded. He had been keeping an eye on the powerful disciples in the previous rounds. This Liu Feifei was one of the powerful disciples.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Speaking of which, within Extreme Celestial Sect, the power of the Liu Family was not inferior to the Zhao Family. This Liu Feifei was an outstanding talent from the Liu Family. In her previous matches, there had been no need for her to reveal her true strength for her to finish off her opponents. Thus, Chen Feng did not know how strong she truly was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Feifei was the first to enter the arena and she waited for Chen Feng. She was a slender woman with a lustrous skin and a graceful bearing. She sported long, shapely eye brows and was a peerless beauty. When he got a good look at her, Chen Feng felt his heart shaking. However, he was quick to recollect himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heh! A cultivator who lacks a steady heart would likely lose without a fight against her</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Greetings, Senior Brother Chen.” As Chen Feng was regarding Liu Feifei, she too, was regarding him. Moreover, her voice was soft and pleasant to the ears, giving others a comfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I wouldn’t dare. You should call me Junior Brother,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Level wise, Chen Feng was just at level 7 of the Concealed stage while Liu Feifei was at level 2 of the Sky Human stage. The average cultivator would find it very hard to fill the gap between these two levels.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Senior Brother Chen, you are too modest. In our world of cultivation, everything is decided by strength. The sect also doesn’t place importance over when you join the sect. Rather, they look at how strong you are,” Liu Feifei said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In other words, you think you will lose?” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It feels like it. However, we will have to fight it out to be certain.” After saying that, Liu Feifei brought out a sword. It looked like an ordinary sword, but one glance was all it took for Chen Feng to determine that the sword was an extraordinary item.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sacred artefact!” Chen Feng uttered in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, this is a Sacred artefact. I did not bring it out in the previous matches. However, not bringing it out for this match doesn’t seem to be an option,” Liu Feifei said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Unexpectedly, Chen Feng ended up facing Liu Feifei.” A smile appeared on Fu Yue’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have a good relationship with Liu Feifei. You should know her true strength, right?” Mu Lingfeng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A little.” Fu Yue nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, who do you think will win?” Mu Lingfeng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hmm.” Fu Yue grew hesitant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why? Is it hard to determine?” Mu Lingfeng revealed an amused look.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although Liu Feifei has only overcome 2 Lightning Tribulations, she is very strong. Additionally, she is wielding a Sacred artefact. She can kill a higher-level opponent. And yet, in this match, she is the one with the higher level of cultivation. Logically speaking, she should be the winner,” Fu Yue analysed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh, is that so? You believe that Liu Feifei will win?” Mu Lingfeng said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Fu Yue nodded, believing that her good friend will win this match.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I think Chen Feng will win,” Mu Lingfeng suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why do you say that? Did you notice anything?” Fu Yue felt surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, this is just a hunch.” Mu Lingfeng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Liu Feifei bring out a Sacred artefact, Chen Feng knew that he was facing a true expert. Not daring to be careless, he too, brought out the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When he brought out the Demon Sealing Sword, Chen Feng secretly sighed. Unfortunately, he would still have to rely on the Demon Sealing Sword to win this Grand Competition. It was not his own true strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, don’t be careless! Even with the Demon Sealing Sword, you might not be able to defeat this little girl.” Tower’s voice rang out within Chen Feng’s sea of wisdom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh?” Chen Feng was surprised and he quickly focused even more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although the grade of her Sacred artefact is not as high as your Demon Sealing Sword, you cannot unleash the Demon Sealing Sword’s full power,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You mean to say this Liu Feifei can unleash the full power of the Sacred artefact in her hand?” Chen Feng was even more shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. That is what I mean,” Tower replied with an amused tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is that possible?” Chen Feng nearly uttered out for real.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nothing is impossible. Kid, you must exercise caution in this match.” However, Tower’s voice contained a hint of glee at Chen Feng’s predicament. It seemed Tower was itching to see Chen Feng’s fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Chen, are you ready? I am going to attack now.” Liu Feifei’s smile was like a flower. She raised the sword in her hand, aiming it at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When the sword was aimed at Chen Feng, he immediately sensed an invisible power locking onto him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng began moving around, changing his positions without respite. However, he could not shake off the formidable power locking down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Impressive!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng secretly praised. That alone informed Chen Feng that this Liu Feifei was not easy to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demon Sealing Sword swiftly slashed out and Chen Feng immediately sensed the sharp edge of his sword cutting away a very faint strand of something that was before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The aura locking down on him was eliminated, but Liu Feifei was quick to execute her attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Feifei’s steps were light and her body moved like a ghost. In just a flash, she arrived before Chen Feng. The sharpness of her sword caused Chen Feng’s hairs to stand on end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Demon Sealing Sword quickly blocked the incoming sword. As the two swords clashed, Chen Feng could feel the Demon Sealing Sword releasing a formidable power. The power it displayed this time exceeded that of its previous displays of might.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Feifei’s body flinched. Then, she rapidly backed away, leaving a series of after-images in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although Chen Feng managed to repel Liu Feifei, he felt a suction force coming from the Demon Sealing Sword. The suction force devoured a portion of his primary energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What is happening?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Did you think Sacred artefacts are that easy to control? Sacred artefacts are different from Prized artefact. In order to utilize Sacred artefacts, it is only natural that you will need to sacrifice something in return. Fortunately, this is you we're talking about. If some average Concealed stage cultivator attempts to utilize this Sacred artefact, that cultivator would be sucked dry,” Tower said with a chortle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If so, this will be troublesome. Looks like that Liu Feifei does not have this problem.” Chen Feng looked at Liu Feifei, who had already steadied herself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The sword in your hand is a top-grade Sacred artefact?” Liu Feifei cast a shocked look at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! I don’t know what grade it is at. However, it is definitely of a higher grade compared to the Sacred artefact in your hand. Am I being the bully here?” Chen Feng said with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is not considered bullying. Even if you can bring out an Immortal artefact, it is considered your own strength.” After saying that, Liu Feifei displayed her movement technique once more to attack Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng was already mobilizing all of his soul power and the Soulflame within his sea of wisdom burned. His eyes were wholly focused. And yet, he was still incapable of catching Liu Feifei’s movements. He could only rely on his instincts to sense Liu Feifei’s position.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng failed to block Liu Feifei’s attack. A fine sword beam flashed by and a small wound appeared on Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Too fast! What kind of movement technique is this? It is even faster compared to Chi Lianfeng’s Freedom Movement</span></em><span>. Chen Feng was shocked and he hastily put up a thick shield of astral energy around his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the layer of astral energy was easily cut open and another wound appeared on Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The wound was not particularly large. Firstly, it was because Chen Feng had been quick to dodge. Secondly, he was wearing the body armour. Even so, Chen Feng could feel streams of rapidly spinning sword energy invading his body, wreaking havoc within his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thankfully, the body armour he wore had blocked off 99 % of the sword energy. Thanks to that, Chen Feng was able to utilize his own power to refine the sword energy invading his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dimension!” Chen Feng shouted with a hushed tone and a layer of barrier suddenly appeared to envelop his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of striking sounds rang out from across Chen Feng’s body, each strike by Liu Feifei causing sparks to burst outwards.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“To be able to practice the Nine Cycles Phantom Movement Technique to such a degree, Junior Sister Liu’s cultivation base has grown. It seems it won’t be long before she undergoes her 3<sup>rd</sup> Lightning Tribulation,” Fu Yue said smilingly. Seeing Chen Feng in a disadvantageous position, Fu Yue felt pleased.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is not just the Nine Cycles Phantom Movement Technique. She has even reached minor success level in her Void Sword Technique. As expected of the number one figure amongst the Liu Family’s younger generation,” Mu Lingfeng said, smiling as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Mu, do you still think that Chen Feng will win?” Fu Yue asked, grinning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! The fight has only just begun. It is still too early to be talking about the outcome. Besides, the Sacred artefact in Chen Feng’s hand is nothing to scoff about. It is several grades higher than the Sacred artefact in Liu Feifei’s hand,” Mu Lingfeng replied with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So what? He has yet to fully master it.” Fu Yue smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This girl’s movement technique is too fast. If I didn’t have the Demon Sealing Sword, I would have been cleaved apart long ago.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was secretly surprised at Liu Feifei’s show of strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the barrier – created by his sword’s dimensional power – on the verge of breaking under Liu Feifei’s continuous attacks, Chen Feng swung the Demon Sealing Sword and displayed the Longevity Sword Technique.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Longevity Sword Technique that Chen Feng displayed was at a much higher level than before. Furthermore, the moves within his Longevity Sword Technique would also improve alongside the improvement of his cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span><em>Longevity sword ignites the force of life!</em> Chen Feng swung. Only after seeing the power behind the move he displayed did Chen Feng realize how powerful the sword technique was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A sword silhouette suddenly expanded before converging back once again. Next, a series of exploding sounds rang out from space itself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?” Liu Feifei uttered out in shock. She did not think that Chen Feng could stop her attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Great! The Longevity Sword Technique is truly wondrous. Looks like I have underestimated the Longevity Scripture in the past.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng felt pleasantly surprised. The power within the sword kept rising. Strands of sword light swirled about chaotically to envelop Chen Feng’s figure while shooting towards Liu Feifei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!” Reading Chen Feng’s thoughts, Tower reflexively released a furious snort. He had always shown anger towards Chen Feng’s laziness in practicing the Longevity Scripture. Now, the opportunity had come for him to mock him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I told you long ago. The Longevity Scripture is a peerless cultivation technique. I have never heard of any other secret technique that is better than the Longevity Scripture. You just don’t know anything. Instead, you keep trying to learn those crappy stuff from other sects. See? Now you know just how powerful it is!” Tower said smugly.</span></p>
