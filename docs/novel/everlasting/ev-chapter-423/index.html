 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Chen Feng appeared before Jian Xiaotian and the others, they were all taken aback.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, your aura?” asked a puzzled Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that very moment, Chen Feng resembled a volcano that could erupt at any moment. His fleshly body radiated firmness and sharpness while bolts of lightning kept flashing within the depths of his eyes. Just a glance from Chen Feng could cause their hearts to shudder. They quickly turned away to avoid Chen Feng’s gaze, their hearts shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sage Enigma Flame appeared before Chen Feng and regarded him from head to toe. Then, he tutted in amazement. “Dear apprentice, your strength has risen so quickly! What kind of cultivation is this?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I found a spot with life and death energies here and was able to bolster my opened Life and Death acupoints. It is only natural that my cultivation base would soar after that,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Life and Death acupoints! You actually managed to open up those two insight acupoints? Kid, you are truly powerful.” Old Freak Ming, too, appeared before Chen Feng and he cast an astounded gaze at Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I only managed to open them up thanks to luck.” Chen Feng nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the look of shock still etched on Old Freak Ming’s face, Chen Feng secretly asked Tower, “Tower, are the two insight acupoints very difficult to open?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course! I have already told you this last time, but only some Human Immortals can open up these high-level insight acupoints,” Tower said amusedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“But it feels fairly easy for me,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally, it is because you are cultivating the Longevity Scripture. If it were not for that, you would have been incapable of opening the Life and Death acupoints even after 100 years,” Tower said with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng secretly nodded. He stopped asking questions. He also understood why Old Freak Ming would reveal such a shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng looked around. This recent period of cultivation had allowed Jian Xiaotian and the others to make great strides in their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Pot Brothers had already overcome their 2<sup>nd</sup> Lightning Tribulations to become level 2 Sky Human stage cultivators. Additionally, the primary energies within the bodies of all five were vigorous while their divine senses were overflowing. It would not take long for them to reach level 3 of the Sky Human stage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The auras emanating from Knight Yaoblade, Grotto Mistress Hypnosis and Sage Beastdrive were also fluctuating about constantly. Clearly, they were already close to another breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian, Lin Shaokun and Ye Tian’s Essence, Energy and Soul were well integrated. Although they had yet to overcome their next Lightning Tribulation, their level of strength had risen considerably as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the Beast King and the others, they had long since made a full recovery. It was all because they could absorb the immortal energy within the Minor Dimension for their recuperation process.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The rate of cultivation inside this place is too fast. I had originally assumed that it would take me at least eight to ten years before my next Lightning Tribulation, perhaps even tens of years before that. That amount of time has grown shorter by tens of times. If I can continue cultivating here, attaining the Human Immortal stage will not be impossible for me,” Knight Yaoblade said, a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is not that simple. Due to the governing laws inside this Minor Dimension, the rate of cultivation for the earlier levels is relatively fast. However, wanting to rise to the Human Immortal stage here is practically an impossibility.” One of the Yao Kings beside Mu Sheng spoke up. The Yao King’s original form was that of a bird. It had secretly helped Chen Feng and his friends when they were fighting against the invading cultivators in the past.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were in the midst of their discussion, their surroundings suddenly shook and the spiritual energy around them was thrown into a state of chaos. Cracks began spreading out across the hard ground, shocking everyone present.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going on here?” Everyone panicked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This Minor Dimension must be under attack. It is most likely that the cultivators from Nine Firmaments Palace are the ones behind this,” Mu Sheng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. This Minor Dimension is an Immortal artefact, albeit in another form. No matter how many Human Immortals they send, it will be useless. Additionally, we have already mastered the means to control this Minor Dimension. Even if they can find the entrance, they will still be incapable of entering,” one of the Yao Kings said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The only thing to fear is the emergence of Earthen Immortals. Additionally, each of the Ten Great Immortal Dao Sects has a few Immortal artefacts of their own to guard the sect. Even if they are just broken magic treasures, they would still possess great powers. The way I see it, we will have to quickly come up with a plan,” Sage Enigma Flame said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He had only just uttered those words when another collision occurred. The ground beneath them and the space around them were overturned. Chen Feng and the others, whose cultivation bases were weaker, were immediately sent tumbling. The blood energy within their bodies churned and the impulse to puke blood rose to the fore.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No questions needed. The other party must have utilized Immortal artefacts.” The expression on Sage Enigma Flame’s face sank badly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’ll join forces. Control the Minor Dimension to attack them,” a Yao King suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. We have yet to fully master this Immortal artefact. We will surely be no match for the enemy. The way I see it, we should control this Immortal artefact and have it conceal itself first,” Mu Sheng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were discussing the matter, the interior of the Minor Dimension grew more chaotic. The trees were completely uprooted, the rivers began flowing in the reverse order and even the rolling mountains began crashing down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and the others had to mobilize all their powers to resist the ceaseless waves of power assailing them from their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right! Everyone, join forces to conceal this Minor Dimension first!” They finally came to an agreement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thus, Sage Enigma Flame and his group brought out four black tokens. After injecting magic power into them, the four tokens instantly shone with a dazzling light. Rays of light shone out from the surface of the tokens to slip into space, joining up with the Minor Dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The entire Minor Dimension shook. Next, it broke space to conceal itself within the void.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! The Immortal artefact has disappeared! It must be concealing itself within the void!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are actually incapable of locking down its energy signature. Looks like it is of a higher grade compared to our sect guardian Immortal artefacts!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If that is the case, capturing them is an absolute necessity! Snatch it from them! If we don’t, they will surely become a source of calamity.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three cultivators were hovering high above Azuremist Mountain, a magic treasure in each cultivator’s hand. All three magic treasures were enveloped by a sphere of light, making it impossible to determine their appearances. However, one thing was certain. All three magic treasures were Immortal artefacts. Earlier, these three cultivators were the ones utilizing the three Immortal artefacts to attack the Minor Dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All three of them were high-level Human Immortals, from Nine, Purple and Transcendent Firmaments Palace respectively.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After the Minor Dimension disappeared, it left not a single aura behind. However, the three of them were unwilling to simply back away like this. They wanted to continue utilizing the Immortal artefacts in their hands to find the Minor Dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ten days later, Sage Enigma Flame and his group finally stopped their actions. By then, the Minor Dimension had already settled down. Using the Immortal artefact’s innate power, the damages incurred from the attacks were already completely repaired.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We should be safe now. We can stay here with peace of mind. After waiting for a bit, we can return to Eternal World,” Mu Sheng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! Although it is an Immortal artefact, this treasure is somewhat peculiar. It is unsuitable for the cultivation of Human Immortals like us. Still, these little fellows are progressing rapidly,” Sage Enigma Flame said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Master, is it still possible to leave this Minor Dimension?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Of course. What is it? Surely you aren’t thinking of leaving? This place is a good spot for your cultivation efforts though,” replied a puzzled Sage Enigma Flame.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cultivating here can indeed lead to a faster rate of progress. Not to mention, it is filled with immortal energy. Any cultivator would be willing to cultivate here. However, my cultivation technique is somewhat unique. If I want to break through again, I will need to go out and fight other cultivators. Only then can I keep on improving. Hiding here to cultivate myself, I fear the loss of pressure. That would cause my rate of cultivation to slow down instead,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Sage Enigma Flame nodded. “Your words are right. Very well. If you want to leave, then leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite saying he wanted to leave the Minor Dimension, Chen Feng had still spent another half a year cultivating within the Minor Dimension before finally making ready to depart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun decided to leave with Chen Feng. Jian Xiaotian wanted to return to the Central Plains while Lin Shaokun wanted to go visit his master. At any rate, Lin Shaokun had been gone for quite some time. Additionally, his master was still injured.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for Ye Tian, the Knight Yaoblade trio and the Pot Brothers, they would be staying inside the Minor Dimension. At any rate, it would be very dangerous for them to follow Chen Feng out. Not to mention, the cultivation conditions of the Minor Dimension made it practically a dream come true for them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We will send you three out right now. However, there is no telling where we’ll end up sending you fellows. After getting out, you fellows will need to take care of yourselves. Now, we will leave the coordinates for the Minor Dimension within your minds. It will be easier for you fellows to find it in the future,” said Mu Sheng, who sent a stream of light into the minds of Chen Feng, Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun respectively.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the four black tokens shone with light again and a spatial passageway swiftly appeared before the three of them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right, just step inside,” Sage Enigma Flame said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s team of three nodded their heads. Then, one by one, they walked into the spatial passageway.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a booming sound, the spatial passageway closed up and Chen Feng’s team of three disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, the three youngsters will be able to stay safe,” Old Freak Ming said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! My apprentice is not to be underestimated. He will definitely be able to assail the Immortal Plane in the future. There is no need for us to worry. We should instead focus on cultivating ourselves. It’s true that the laws here are very strong and that they are suppressing our rate of cultivation. However, if we can comprehend the immortal dao laws here, it would be highly beneficial for us,” Sage Enigma Flame said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite saying that, a hint of concern could be seen deep within Sage Enigma Flame’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Stormwave Lake…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One of the ten largest lakes in the Northern Plains, it covered a radius of over 5,000 kilometres. Some areas of this lake were bottomless and not even Sky Human stage cultivators would dare to casually enter them. There were many yao beasts residing within the lake. There were even some formidable Yao Kings standing guard within certain areas of the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Mountains covered in forest and playing host to yao beasts were places that human cultivators would venture into. The same was true for the vast Stormwave Lake. Human cultivators could occasionally be seen flying across the sky above Stormwave Lake. Some could also be seen riding boats across the surface of the lake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It could be said that the more dangerous a place was, the more attractive of an adventuring spot it would be for cultivators.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, a large, 100-zhang-long ship was slowly advancing across the surface of the lake. Cultivators, in groups of twos and threes, stood above the ship. The cultivators were spreading their soul powers down to scan the area beneath the waters as they chatted amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hopefully, I can get something this time. Last time, I had nearly gotten the yao core of a wyrm,” one of the cultivators said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t brag, will you? If a powerful wyrm truly shows up, our entire boat will be devoured in one gulp.” One of the nearby cultivators scoffed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why would I lie to you fellows? It happened last month. I witnessed a human cultivator fighting to the death against a wyrm. Finally, they were mutually wounded. Unfortunately, the spoils went to some other fellows in the end.” The cultivator’s face was filled with disappointment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh? Did that really happen? Hurry, tell us the details!” One of the cultivators grew interested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Plop! Plop! Plop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, three human figures descended swiftly from the sky. Like meteors, they smashed heavily into the lake. Due to massive impact, three pillars of water exploded up into the sky, each with a height of 100 zhang. Even the advancing ship was affected in the end and it rocked left and right above the lake.</span></p>
