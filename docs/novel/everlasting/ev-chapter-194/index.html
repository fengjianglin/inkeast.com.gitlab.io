<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Observing the large, hill-like demonic face, Chen Feng thought to himself. <em>What kind of technique is this? Would this face try to eat me up?&nbsp;</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s guess was spot on. The large demonic face abruptly opened up its mouth and a force directly brought Chen Feng into its mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It is seriously eating me?</span></em><span>&nbsp;The thought flashed through Chen Feng’s mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng struggled fiercely only to sense sticky slime all round him. The more he struggled, the more uncomfortable it made him. He could also feel a corrosive force acting upon his body. It did not take long for itchy and pricking sensations to beset his skin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This is definitely demonic energy, but its power has risen to such a degree.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng attempted to absorb some of them and felt that it was very difficult to refine. However, it was still impossible for the demonic energy to corrode him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a more broadly known technique in the Demon Plane. Honestly speaking, it is nothing. If your cultivation base is any higher, you could gulp down all of this transformed demonic energy. Another option is to break it through brute force,” Tower said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng could feel the demonic energy around him gradually becoming thicker. Additionally, one tendril after another began growing out to wrap him up. After struggling a few times, Chen Feng found that he was unable to break out. He could feel that 80 % of the force that his four limbs were unleashing into his surroundings was dissipated by the demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua! Shua! Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng brought out the Overwhelming Astral Sword to cut the layers of demonic energy around him. However, the layers of demonic energy were like sugar candy. They rapidly gathered together again and the wrapping strength behind them grew even more resilient.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Brandishing Bloody Soul, Chen Feng kept stabbing holes into the layers of demonic energy around him, but to no avail. There were too many layers of demonic energy around him. Unless Chen Feng could break out fast enough, it would not work.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! These layers of demonic energy are formed from all the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters’ demonic energy. Even with Prized artefacts, it will be difficult for you to break through,” said Tower, who cackled at Chen Feng’s misfortune.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After struggling for a moment, Chen Feng felt that he was simply wasting his strength. Thus, he stopped attacking, leaving just the Overwhelming Astral Sword to protect himself while he gathered his strength and instead concentrated on assailing the barrier in his sea of wisdom. He wanted to succeed in reaching level 3 of the Concealed stage in one fell swoop.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s Soulflame kept bombarding the barrier, causing more and more cracks to appear on the barrier and eventually, strands of extremely pure energy flowed out from the cracks. The power contained within each strand shocked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The first strand of energy to flow out immediately unleashed out a formidable force, clashing against Chen Feng’s sea of wisdom to abruptly make Chen Feng’s sea of wisdom one notch larger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another strand of energy flowed out and Chen Feng felt his soul shudder as a result. The brightness of his Soulflame suddenly soared as its flames rose high.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another strand of energy flowed out. This time, the strand of energy charged through his sea of wisdom to enter his Heavenly Origin acupoint. Instantly, his Heavenly Origin acupoint roiled as waves of formidable power kept growing within it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The following strands of energy became like bolts of lightning, tearing open the sky and the earth, charging forward with an overbearing nature into the Magnetic, Celestial Yang, Celestial Metropolis and Celestial Fate acupoints that Chen Feng had opened. A heavy feeling pressed down on Chen Feng. It was as though a moment’s carelessness on his part would result in the explosive destruction of those insight acupoints.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After nearly filling up the insight acupoints, the strands of energy flowing out from the sea of wisdom began filling Chen Feng’s meridians, muscles, bones, internal organs, blood and every other part of his body as they circulated around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The power he had exhausted in the earlier fight recovered in the span of just a few breaths. Additionally, it was surging with an even greater intensity. As for the wounds on his body, they were healing up at a noticeable rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The amount of wondrous energy released this time is so high!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was shocked. At this rate, he would be engulfed by the energy once the 3<sup>rd</sup> barrier was broken. In the end, the overpowering energy will cause his body to self-destruct.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, however, those thoughts were useless. The number of cracks on the barrier was increasing and more strands of energy shot out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh, although this kid’s body and soul essence were damaged back then, the energy essence hidden inside his sea of wisdom can make up for it. Although his talent is not very outstanding, cultivating step-by-step will make a very solid foundation,” Tower said coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A snapping sound rang out. As Chen Feng’s soul power grew stronger, a small opening finally appeared upon the barrier. A thunderous rumble immediately reverberated as the energy flowing out from the opening became like a torrential river.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua! Shua! Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The mighty power washed over every part of Chen Feng’s body. Chen Feng could feel the pure and cooling energy washing his bones and meridians, ridding the impurities away from them to make his fleshly body even stronger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The barrier before his 3<sup>rd</sup> sea of wisdom layer was completely broken at last. Like a waterfall flowing in reverse, the streams of energy roared out like tidal waves and Chen Feng felt his Soulflame shuddering, seemingly on the verge of extinguishing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Too powerful, too powerful!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng’s whole body was trembling as goose bumps broke out across his body. His soul was quaking ceaselessly. It was not a power that Chen Feng could refine and absorb.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hua! Hua! Hua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>His Heavenly Origin acupoint had been filled to the brim and could no longer fill any more of the energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The absorption rate of his two Magnetic acupoints was also beginning to slow down. Furthermore, it seemed as though they were about to be filled up soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only his Tristar acupoints could continue absorbing the surging streams of energy at a leisurely pace. However, the rate at which they were absorbing the energy was too slow. Chen Feng feared that he would be incapable of holding on before the energy blew up his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s meridians began swelling and his bones creaked. His fleshly body became like an expanding ball. Without any proper way of dealing with it, Chen Feng would surely die as his body blew up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, do I send this energy over to you?” Chen Feng suddenly suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. This power belongs to you. You must use your own abilities to refine and absorb it. Also, don’t think about transferring the power into other magic treasures. I will not allow you to do that.” Tower’s voice became strict and inviolable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“My own abilities,” Chen Feng blurted out. Feeling the ever-expanding power and his swelling body, Chen Feng knew he no longer had any time to waste.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do you think I have no other options? I will continue assailing the other insight acupoints!” hissed Chen Feng through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>According to the records in the Longevity Scripture, the next insight acupoints to be opened were the Four Extreme acupoints. The East Extreme, South Extreme, West Extreme and North Extreme insight acupoints.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Moving freely across the four directions, the Four Symbols revolve in a circle, soaring through the sky as though it was land, making its way past all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The four insight acupoints were located on his hands and feet. Chen Feng had long since known about its cultivation method. He had originally planned on waiting for his cultivation base of level 3 of the Concealed stage to solidify before cultivating the Four Extreme acupoints. At that moment, however, he could no longer wait.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng channelled the Longevity Scripture’s cultivation technique and the streams of primary energy inside his body changed their flowing pattern. It began flowing towards his right palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A booming sound rang out from his palm. It felt as though his palm had nearly blown up and a wave of heart-piercing pain spread throughout his entire body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Without waiting for the pain to dissipate, Chen Feng spurred all the primary energy in his body to assail his right palm once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After assailing it for 18 time in a row, his right palm released another booming sound and Chen Feng smiled. The churning energy within his body – released from his sea of wisdom – had begun to flow and gather within his right palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt as though his right palm had transformed into a bell-mouth spillway within a deep sea, which kept devouring the waves of energy around it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hu!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In but a few breaths’ worth of time, the amount of energy swallowed up by his right palm grew so high, Chen Feng felt it was enough for him to cultivate for months. The rate at which his body was swelling up slowed down. However, it had only slowed down. He had yet to solve the problem of his body blowing up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Still, this power was enough.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng slowly extended his right hand before abruptly pushing forward, causing an overpowering shockwave to spread out across the sticky demonic energy. The shockwave caused the entire demonic face to shake unsteadily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, the demonic face remained there. Chen Feng had failed to break free.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng reached his hand out. Brandishing Bloody Soul in his hand, his own mighty power flowed and merged as one with the bloody lance. Then, he stabbed forward. With a burst, an opening was created on the demonic face. After that, Chen Feng, still wielding the bloody lance in his hand, charged out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After escaping the demonic face, Chen Feng unleashed his might. Bloody Soul created an entire stretch of lance silhouettes and the large demonic face before him immediately collapsed, shattering into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What other techniques do you have?” Chen Feng sneered as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters surrounding Chen Feng were stunned. They did not think that Chen Feng could escape the demonic face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng stabbed out diagonally with Bloody Soul and the air quaked outwards to reveal an invisible Phantom Beast there. Chen Feng had stabbed it with his lance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right now, I am tens of times stronger than before. This degree of invisibility is now useless against me,” said Chen Feng as the Phantom Beast was reduced into a shrivelled-up corpse.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Bloody Soul filled the entire sky with lance silhouettes, which shot towards the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters around Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi! Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every single one of the lance silhouettes could casually kill one of the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters. In but the blink of an eye, tens of Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters had fallen to Chen Feng’s attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The remaining Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters felt a shiver run down their guts. Dread. Despite their ferocity, the Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters were still fearful of death. That was especially true given how pointless those deaths were. All creatures would feel fear in the face of a powerful opponent. Even the world’s most savage creature was not exempted from this fact. The only exception would be those without souls like wooden puppets.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Under the wild barrage of attacks from Chen Feng, all the remaining Demonic Bloodthirsty Hunters scattered. Even the Phantom Beasts that were hiding around chose not to attack. Instead, they silently left.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not give chase as there was something more important on his mind. His 3<sup>rd</sup> sea of wisdom layer was still roiling about. Streams of energy sprayed out like a fountain. His opening of one of the Four Extreme acupoints had only slowed down the problem. It had not resolved it.</span></p>
