 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunderhawk, still in his wild-looking human form, quickly emerged from the forest to once again transform into the sky encompassing, sun-blotting, gigantic hawk. It rapidly chased after Tie Changkong and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun exchanged glances. They both sighed to themselves. They understood that Liu Xihua, who did not possess a Prized artefact, had most likely fallen under the Thunderhawk’s hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An overpowering aura charged forth from behind them and their faces turned incomparably grim.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do we really have to stop and go a few rounds with this Thunderhawk?” Tie Changkong’s voice was hard and sword light flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is courting death. The Thunderhawk has at least 2 Lightning Tribulations under its belt. Do you think the two of us are a match for this Great Yao? Even if Liu Tian and the others were to come help us, we would still have no chance of winning,” said Shangguan Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I don’t see it that way. We have already cultivated out our domain powers while Liu Tian has already reached level 9 of the Concealed stage. Add Xu Ziping and Chen Feng, we may actually be able to go a few rounds with this Thunderhawk,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You already know that it is just a possibility. Do not forget, the two of the us are the only ones in danger of facing the Thunderhawk right now,” said Shangguan Yun with a scoff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was the truth. As the one with the highest cultivation base and in possession of a Prized artefact, Liu Tian’s flying speed was the fastest. By then, he was no longer within their sights. As for Xu Ziping and Chen Feng, they were ahead of both Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun. The two of them were at the rearmost position and could end up facing the Thunderhawk at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunderhawk’s broad wings gave an abrupt flap. Two intense hurricanes blew forth to transform into two wind dragons, which swirled towards Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Attack incoming!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun grunted and simultaneously launched their own attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong unleashed a swift and firm sword beam. As the sword beam sliced forward, it seemingly left a clean cut in its wake.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Grandsky Sword Beam!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With lightning-like speed, the sword beam sliced its way towards the wind dragon to cut it in half.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for Shangguan Yun, the attack she unleashed was rather peculiar. It appeared to be a soft, multi-coloured ribbon. Who knows what materials were used in the making of the ribbon, but it appeared incomparably pliable, capable of floating gently in the air, making her look like a fairy dancing in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, after fluttering in the air for a bit, the soft ribbon transformed. From a length of two zhang, it grew to a length of over 100 zhang, covering part of the sky. Next, gentle yet firm hurricanes swirled out from the ribbons to meet the incoming wind dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surprisingly, Shangguan Yun was utilizing wind-type techniques to fight against the Thunderhawk. Furthermore, the ribbon fluttering in the sky was also a Prized artefact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two booming sounds rang out and potent energy streams scattered across the sky. The two wind dragons that the Thunderhawk sent out were unravelled by Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, who was in the midst of flying away, turned and saw the sky encompassing ribbons and the sky-slicing sword beam colliding against the two surging wind dragons.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Although the two have decent cultivation bases and Prized artefacts in hand, they are certainly no match for the Thunderhawk. If this continues, Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun will surely end up dead,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After considering it for a moment, Chen Feng turned towards Xu Ziping, who was up ahead, and shouted, “Brother Xu. If the four of us join forces, we should be able to put up a fight against the Thunderhawk.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have no desire to go die.” Xu Ziping’s cool voice came over. Next, the Lightstream Shield beneath his feet shone with greater intensity and his flying speed rose again. Clearly, he had no intentions of joining the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng regarded the endless forest spreading out before him before turning back to see the two cultivators engaged in a violent battle against the Thunderhawk. Chen Feng hesitated. Back when he was in danger, they had not helped him. Naturally, there was no need for him to help them as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, Chen Feng had no desire to see Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun die to the Thunderhawk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng’s heart was in turmoil, Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun exchanged another blow with the Thunderhawk. In that small span of time, Chen Feng had flown tens of li forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Skybreak Sword Beam!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Flying Cloud Ribbon!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A formidable sword beam rose high into the sky. The pure sword intent and potent sword energy within it brought shock to the distant Chen Feng. Immediately after that, Chen Feng saw multi-coloured ribbons covering the sky. Was that the descent of fairies or was that the mad dance of demons and monsters? Thus, the battle became more intense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The offensive power of sword cultivators from Sword Hall is the strongest. That is a well-known fact. However, I did not think that the techniques of Flowing Cloud Hall are also this powerful. Although Shangguan Yun’s ribbons look terribly weak, the attacks unleashed by it are extremely overbearing. If the two of them have reached the Sky Human stage, they would have no need to fear this Great Yao</span></em><span>. Chen Feng analysed the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Purplebolt, how far along is your recovery?” Chen Feng secretly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt, who was lying within the Longevity Tower, answered weakly, “I have only recovered by 10 %.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You have consumed so much of my Magic crystals, only to recover so little?” Chen Feng said with a slightly displeased tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“As I have already overcome Lightning Tribulation, I am now a genuine Great Yao. Although these Magic crystals are decent, they can no longer keep up with the requirements of my cultivation base. Prized crystals would be more suitable for me,” Purplebolt said softly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Prized crystals are at a higher level compared to Magic crystals. That is the spirit stone that Sky Human stage cultivators generally use for cultivation. You sure can dream. A pity, I don’t have any,” Chen Feng said tepidly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Without Prized crystals, some yao cores will do as well. Besides, don’t you also have a Thunderhawk egg?” Purplebolt said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng considered it for a moment before saying, “Don’t even think about getting the two yao cores. I need them for my cultivation practice. That one Thunderhawk egg, on the other hand, is full of vitality. If you take it, you should be able to recover quite a bit, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Indeed. However, it is currently too weak. Wait for a little while longer. When the life force within the Thunderhawk egg has reached its peak, I will take action. Perhaps, we can utilize certain methods to make the Thunderhawk egg even stronger. That way, devouring the egg will be more pleasing,” said Purplebolt with a slight chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Chen Feng could not stop himself from frowning. He understood that yaos were different from humans. Yaos could directly devour the yao cores and essence of their own kind to practice cultivation. They would not face the high risk that humans face while doing so.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had originally planned on hatching the Thunderhawk egg and raise it up. At that moment, however, Chen Feng had changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ignoring how long it would take to hatch the Thunderhawk egg, there was also the matter of how long it would take for the hatchling to cultivate up to the Great Yao stage. Chen Feng was also certain, by the time he accomplished that, he himself would be at a far higher cultivation stage. After recognizing that, Chen Feng discarded his plan of hatching the Thunderhawk egg.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Of course, if the hatchling could possess a Great Yao cultivation base the moment it hatched, Chen Feng can reconsider.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Some methods are required. However, it will take some time. Since you have yet to recover, just stay inside the Longevity Tower and heal up with peace of mind. We’ll talk again after I deal with this current crisis,” said Chen Feng coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was conversing with Purplebolt, his flying speed slowed down. Additionally, the battle behind him was also affecting him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a swipe of its claws, the Thunderhawk crushed the formidable sword beam that Tie Changkong sent out. As for the Flowing Cloud Ribbon’s attack that Shangguan Yun sent out, it was smashed apart by the mighty winds created by the Thunderhawk’s broad, flapping wings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun had planned on performing a withdrawal operation. Unexpectedly, after the Thunderhawk pulled them into the fight, they ended up getting pulled ever closer to the Thunderhawk. They fell into a disadvantageous position and their ability to resist gradually weakened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thunderhawk’s large wing slapped Tie Changkong, sending him flying over 100 zhang through the sky. If it were not for Shangguan Yun going all out to stop the Thunderhawk, it would have caught and shredded him with its claws.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even so, Tie Changkong was still in a terrible state. His figure tumbled continuously through the sky, blood spraying out from his mouth all the time. Pain wracked every corner of his body like never before. That exchange earlier had broken more than 10 bones.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng hurriedly moved forward. Extending his hand, he caught Tie Changkong. Next, he felt a violent power – capable of toppling mountains and overturning seas – surge into his body. Chen Feng had no choice but to fly over 100 metres back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Incredible. For Tie Changkong to not die from that attack, he sure is lucky,” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen.” Tie Changkong coughed out another mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems you can no longer fight?” Chen Feng said softly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shangguan Yun!” Tie Changkong’s eyes lit up and he recalled Shangguan Yun. The two of them combined were no match for the Thunderhawk. Now that Shangguan Yun was alone, she was in much greater danger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crack!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A booming sound rang out and the sky-encompassing, multi-coloured ribbons exploded apart. Ribbon fragments filled the sky and Shangguan Yun immediately fell out in a wretched manner from the ribbon fragments. Blood sprayed out from her mouth at a maddening rate.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sighing, Chen Feng swiftly flew forward to catch Shangguan Yun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hu! Hu! Hu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Strong winds blew forward and the astral shield protecting Chen Feng’s body began trembling. Carrying the two cultivators, Chen Feng drove the Overwhelming Astral Sword to quickly retreat while using Bloody Soul to send out stabbing lance silhouettes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The attacks from Bloody Soul dissipated the forceful winds. However, the massive Thunderhawk was already upon Chen Feng. Two large and powerful talons, their surface gleaming with chilling light, grasped towards Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The attack had yet to arrive, but Chen Feng could already feel two overpowering suction force enveloping him. He became like a small fish in the face of a maelstrom. No matter how hard he struggled, it was to no avail. At the same time, heart-piercing sensations struck him. Chen Feng knew that it was due to the intense winds created by the Thunderhawk’s incoming claws.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As he was already locked down by the Thunderhawk, escaping was impossible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, hurry up and run. Don’t bother with us!” Tie Changkong, whom Chen Feng was carrying, suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is right. There is still hope for you if you escape alone. Throwing your life away for our sake is not worth it,” Shangguan Yun said as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. Right now, I probably cannot escape even if I want to,” replied Chen Feng with a wry smile.</span></p>
