 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The sphere of lightning Chen Feng hurled forward exploded and the space there transformed. The lightning sphere had failed to damage the building as water ripples spread out through the air. It seemed as though the space there was created from water.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A thin layer of dimensional barrier appeared over Clearwind City. Chen Feng had only managed to detect it due to his Magic Eyes of Darkness. Any other cultivator would have failed to notice this. Not even Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling, level 8 Sky Human stage cultivators, could notice anything. Thus, they had fallen into this trap. The two sisters’ disappearance and Chen Feng’s sudden feeling of wariness had prompted him to carefully check it out. If it were not for that, he too, would have fallen into this trap.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Operating his Magic Eyes of Darkness, Chen Feng was able to clearly see Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling trapped inside this dimension. Additionally, the two of them had been separated. One was clearly trapped inside an illusion while the other was besieged by a group of yao beasts. Dark light undulated within Chen Feng’s eyes and he was able to discern that those were not real yao beasts. Rather, they were created using some secret technique. It was something similar to the magic techniques of creating soldiers from paper figures or beans.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the two sisters fought inside the dimension, the situation within the city remained the same. The people there kept walking around them and not one could notice anything amiss. It seemed as though the two sisters were in a parallel space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>The two of them are really careless. I wonder how they could cultivate up to this level.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shook his head and his figure prepared to fly down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellow friend!” Suddenly, four cultivators appeared to tightly surround Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are from Heartless Heaven Sect?” Chen Feng asked after regarding the four fellows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We are cultivators from Warlord Pavilion. From what I can see, you are not a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction, right?” one of them said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am not a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction.” Chen Feng nodded as he began pondering. <em>These four fellows are from Warlord Pavilion. So, Warlord Pavilion and Heartless Heaven Sect are working together for this. One is attacking Azuresieve City while the other set up a trap in Clearwind City. To think that I would encounter this situation right after stepping foot in the Central Plains. I wonder how Heavenly Sword Faction is holding up? However, from what I can see, it seems to be in a disadvantageous position.</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, you are not a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction. If so, this will be easy. I ask that you leave,” the one who had spoken up earlier continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he. However, you fellows surrounded me for no good reason. Isn’t this somewhat impolite of you?” Chen Feng chuckled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Friend, we mean you no harm. Please leave,” the man said in a restrained manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>If it weren’t for the fact that they were incapable of determining how powerful Chen Feng was, the four of them would have attacked long ago. Even Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling had easily fallen into this trap. And yet, this unassuming youngster could actually discover this trap of theirs. Additionally, the eye technique that Chen Feng displayed had aroused their sense of vigilance. Since he was not a disciple of Heavenly Sword Faction, not starting a fight with him would be for the best. Besides, they had already informed this youngster that they were from Warlord Pavilion only for him to reveal a look of nonchalance. Thus, this youngster was either a fool or someone with a powerful backing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“But the two sisters down there are my friends.” Chen Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Friend, I don’t care who you are. I have already shown you respect earlier. Others are not allowed to interfere with the affairs of our Warlord Pavilion. Those who do will face death!” Chen Feng’s attitude finally infuriated the four fellows. One of them was finally incapable of holding back. He rushed out to wave his hand, unleashing a Warlord Palm move at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>He was displaying one of Warlord Pavilion’s ultimate techniques, the Warlord Palm Art. It could break mountains, sunder the earth and destroy rivers; invincible and capable of obliterating everything. He had been secretly gathering his strength for this move since Chen Feng appeared. Instantly, his move caused the surrounding space to vibrate violently. Chen Feng, in particular, could sense the space around him becoming frozen. This palm technique was incredibly overbearing, desirous of flattening its target from the get go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng brought out a sword to instantly display the Longevity Sword Technique’s spiralling sword energy technique. A stream of highly compressed sword beam pierced the central part of the incoming palm silhouette with lightning-like speed. Due to that, the thick palm silhouette faltered briefly. Next, Chen Feng’s figure flashed forward, darting through the hole created upon the palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have heard that Warlord Palm Art is unrivalled in the world. How about you try one from me,” Chen Feng said and his palm slowly pushed forward. Next, the Great Longevity Palm silhouette rumbled forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When they saw Chen Feng break the Warlord Palm silhouette, the four cultivators were inwardly shocked. Next, however, they saw Chen Feng display a palm technique of his own. Initially, all four of them grew contemptuous of the move. All of them were the elite disciples of Warlord Pavilion. Thus, every single one of them had practiced the Warlord Palm Art before. They had never – throughout their time in the world of cultivation – encountered another palm technique that could surpass the Warlord Palm Art.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, their faces quickly sank. A great palm silhouette roared out from Chen Feng’s palm and even the air was shattered in its wake. The palm was so thick, it could shatter the earth. The fingers were so thick, they could prop up the sky. Countless energy streams swirled around the palm silhouette as a quaint and overwhelming aura emanated out from the palm silhouette.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No! Hurry, run!” The other three cultivators shouted loudly. The cultivator who was facing this attack was inwardly shocked. Unexpectedly, this opponent was not only capable of breaking his attack, he could even unleash a more profound palm technique.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hah! Let’s see which one is more powerful!” The cultivator gritted his teeth and his fist burst out. Next, a tangible fist silhouette roared towards the Great Longevity Palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, the Great Longevity Palm was like a living object. It instantly grasped, catching the incoming fist silhouette before crushing it in a tight grip. Then, it swiftly flew forward to capture the cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, you have a death wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As they were exchanging blows, the remaining three cultivators arrived before Chen Feng. They unleashed their killer moves at Chen Feng simultaneously, wanting to kill him off in one go.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are choosing to besiege me now? Isn’t it too late for this?” Chen Feng snickered. Sword light flared out from every part of his body to charge into his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All the attacks from the three cultivators were shattered while the three cultivators were knocked down, their bodies stained with blood. However, due to the protection of their body armours, the three of them were only lightly wounded. Even so, they knew that they were no match for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad! This fellow is powerful!” The three cultivators exchanged glances. At the same time, they charged down into the dimension. They were actually leaving their caught member behind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They sure are quick at running.” Chen Feng beckoned and the caught cultivator, still in the grasp of the palm silhouette, flew over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, it doesn’t matter who you are. You will not have a good ending if you offend our Warlord Pavilion!” The caught cultivator forced himself to remain calm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Just a level 5 Sky Human stage cultivator.” Chen Feng shook his head. If the four fellow’s cultivation bases were higher, it would have been problematic. Additionally, they were also careless.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How many of you are there?” Chen Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivator refused to answer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and a power of water and fire poured into the cultivator’s body, causing his muscles to swell up. Streams of the power of water and fire roamed freely through his meridians. In the beginning, he had been capable of enduring it, albeit bitterly. However, after a few breaths’ worth of time, he finally failed to hold on. He began screaming in pain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When a mental gap appeared in his mind, Chen Feng’s Magic Eyes of Darkness spun and two spiritual light shone into the cultivator’s sea of wisdom. Instantly, Chen Feng found everything that he wished to know.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Clearwind City has indeed fallen. Additionally, it was done by the combined forces of Warlord Pavilion and Divine Demon Grotto. This Divine Demon Grotto is also on the same level as Warlord Pavilion and Heavenly Sword Faction. I didn’t think that it would also take part in this war. As I recall, the relationship between Divine Demon Grotto and Warlord Pavilion is not that good. Why would they join forces? For Heartless Heaven Sect, Warlord Pavilion and Divine Demon Grotto to be joining forces, things are not looking good for Heavenly Sword Faction. Is there something else going on here?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was pondering the issue, streams of light radiated from the caught cultivator’s body. It looked as though a clump of flames was exploding. He had made use of the opening to break the palm silhouette. Next, his figure flashed as he flew down into the dimension.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He is pretty fast.” Chen Feng was not feeling too concerned. Instead, he continued hovering up in the sky to check on Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Their situation remained the same. One was trapped inside an illusion while the other was fighting against the yao beasts. Although they were not wounded, they had exhausted a great deal of their strength. That was especially true for Jian Qingwu, who was besieged by the yao beasts. She was sweating all over and her movements were beginning to slow down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>This dimension is truly extraordinary. After falling into it, those that are not at the Human Immortal stage would find it very difficult to escape. Thankfully, I did not enter the city earlier.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng shook his head as he brought out the Four-sided Spirit Mace. It was time he took action. It would be bad if the two sisters ended up exhausting all their strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Empowering the Four-sided Spirit Mace, Chen Feng then smashed down furiously against the barrier of the dimension. Watery ripples spread out across the barrier and the entire Clearwind City shook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four-sided Spirit Mace was a grade 5 Sacred artefact. Back in the Twospan Mountain Range, Chen Feng had utilized this same forceful move to break Blackwind Stronghold’s barrier. Although Chen Feng’s cultivation base was stronger compared to back then, this barrier was far stronger than the barrier of Blackwind Stronghold. Still, the vibrations from his action managed to reach Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling, who were trapped inside. Jian Qingling, in particular, was quick to come to the realization. Swiftly, she charged out from the illusion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Damn it! I was in an illusion!” Jian Qingling gulped down a medicinal pill to replenish her strength as she regarded her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the yao beasts besieging Jian Qingwu, they fell into a state of disarray. A few of them broke apart, turning into piles of sand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Chen Feng is attacking from the outside. Fortunately, Chen Feng did not come in, otherwise it would be difficult for us to escape</span></em><span>, Jian Qingwu thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Four-sided Spirit Mace was raised up high before smashing down against the barrier again. Once again, the barrier remained intact. However, the cultivators in charge of setting up the dimension noticed that the talismans used for the dimension were beginning to crack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Dispatch some men! Kill that kid!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The guy has a Sacred artefact in his hand! Going out is just suicide!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“In that case, delay him! We’ll figure something out after capturing Jian Qingwu and Jian Qingling. If we cannot, this whole thing would have been for naught.”</span></p>
