 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As he was healing his hands to get rid of the feelings of numbness, Chen Feng swiftly flew far away. He flew over 1,000 metres away before slowly landing on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The waters in the pool exploded outwards all of a sudden and a stout and powerful wyrm flew up into the sky. Unfurling its pitch-black body, it immediately caused the weather around it to change. Dark clouds stirred in the sky and frost covered the nearby grounds. The black wyrm swirled about ceaselessly, raising up winds and clouds as it did and the aura of a yao beast filled the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human! You dare encroach upon my territory? You have a death wish!” The black wyrm spoke with the human tongue and its voice reverberated outwards, quaking the ground and causing it to crack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What a formidable Great Yao! I am probably no match for it</span></em><span>, Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are certainly no match for it. This wyrm has become a variant type. It is comparable to a cultivator with 8 Lightning Tribulations under his belt. Even after overcoming your Lightning Tribulation, you will still be no match for it,” Tower said amusedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eight Lightning Tribulations! Even after cultivating up to this level, it still cannot assume human form. Looks like this Immortal artefact is quite profound.” Chen Feng nodded. With a grasping move, he brought the Demon Sealing Sword out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the Demon Sealing Sword in hand, Chen Feng grew more confident and the will to fight began radiating from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Die!” The black wyrm nodded in Chen Feng’s direction and the thick horn on its head immediately fired out a beam of white light. The beam of light was only as thick as a finger. However, it was incredibly fast. Everywhere it went, space itself would be pierced to create ripples in the air. In just the blink of an eye, the beam of white light was already upon Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So fast!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Before Chen Feng could even react to it, the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand took the initiative to move in front of him and form a thick barrier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The white beam of light struck the barrier and white light flashed out, breaking into fragments before scattering about. For Chen Feng, it felt as though a 1,000-zhang-tall mountain had slammed against his body and his whole body was blasted far away. Even the Demon Sealing Sword was nearly knocked away due to the impact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black wyrm’s figure abruptly sped forward to arrive before Chen Feng. Its massive body, flashing with black light, swiped at Chen Feng and space itself erupted in the wake of the swiping attack. Even before the swiping attack reached Chen Feng, he could already feel himself suffocating.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A yellowish stream of light suddenly shot out from Chen Feng’s figure to hit the black wyrm’s body. It was as though a large wooden staff had been used to strike a small snake. The black wyrm cried out wretchedly before quickly darting back into the pool, disappearing from sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the pool became like an erupting volcano and its waters surged towards Chen Feng. This was not a simple water attack. It contained a formidable force capable of even breaking a mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng forced himself to swing the Demon Sealing Sword to instantly cleave the charging stream of water. The two cleaved streams of water then broke apart in the sky to become like a torrential rain. It took a few breaths’ worth of time for the sky to return to a state of tranquillity. As for the pool, it kept on shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! If I hadn’t utilized the Longevity Tower’s power earlier, that attack would have sent me flying. I didn’t think that this wyrm could be so powerful. By the way, why didn’t you kill the black wyrm, Tower?” asked a puzzled Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is not easy to find such a good sparring partner. How could I just kill it?” Tower snickered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, there are life and death energies down there,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Then, you will have to seize it with your own abilities,” Tower continued with an amused tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We have been spending quite a while cultivating inside this place. I fear that Nine Firmaments Palace will not let us go. If their experts come and invade this Minor Dimension, the consequences would be unimaginable!” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t fret! This Immortal artefact is not something that just anyone can break in. Besides, the laws of time here are different from the outside world. According to my rough calculations, 100 days here is only the equivalent of one day outside,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So that’s how it is!” Chen Feng made the calculations and found that only a few days had passed in the outside world. He estimated that the wounded Kuang Feng and Ling Kong had yet to even make it back to their respective sects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng calmed down and entered the Longevity Tower again. After that, he jumped into the lightning pool once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, increase the intensity of the lightning powers,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower waved a hand and a thick power of lightning surged into the lightning pool. Chen Feng could instantly feel that the surrounding lightning powers had grown thicker and more violent. They rampaged about ceaselessly as they charged towards his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng grunted. Every muscle on his body trembled yet again and he gritted his teeth to endure it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ten days later, Chen Feng flew out from the Longevity Tower again and unleashed a formidable palm strike at the pool. The surface of the pool exploded and the pool shook violently.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then waited for one joss stick’s worth of time. However, the black wyrm below did not appear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Eh? Is the wyrm unwilling to appear because of what happened last time with the Longevity Tower?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng wondered. Next, he unleashed a few more palm strikes at the pool in quick succession.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The surface of the pool exploded and streams of water shot up before splashing heavily against the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Let’s see if you can continue to stay inside</span></em><span>. Chen Feng sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, it did not take long before the black wyrm flew out from the pool once again. It opened its mouth and roared at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human! Looks like you really have a death wish!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three beams of white light shot out from its horn in quick succession, flying forward towards Chen Feng from three different directions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng, who had wanted to dodge, felt his body locked down by three auras. Due to that, he knew that it was impossible to dodge. Thus, he spun his body quickly, swinging the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand three times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! &nbsp;Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three booming sounds rang out in quick succession and all the attacks that the black wyrm sent out were broken by Chen Feng. As for Chen Feng, his figure tumbled across the sky through tens of metres before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good! Unexpectedly, after the past few days, my fleshly body has become stronger yet again!” said Chen Feng, who then brought out an Earthen-tier Blood Pill and shoved it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Potent blood essence power exploded within Chen Feng’s body and his skin began taking on a faint reddish colour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All the meridians in his body expanded and an endless power filled his entire body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Come, give me a few more!” Chen Feng strode through the sky, the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand slashing at the wyrm with lightning-like speed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A thick astral energy sliced through space at breakneck speed. Seeing that, the black wyrm quickly dodged. Even so, the astral sword had still managed to graze it, instantly causing several pitch-black scales to fall down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As the scales were in mid-air, they suddenly exploded into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar! Human, how could your power have grown? Could it be due to the sword in your hand? Whatever! The sword is now mine.” Although the black wyrm was suffering from some minor injuries, it did not grow enraged. Instead, a hint of greed had appeared in its eyes. Clearly, it had become interested in the Demon Sealing Sword in Chen Feng’s hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’ve got good eyes. This is a grade 6 Sacred artefact. If you have what it takes, come take it,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, Chen Feng had only just utilized a small portion of the Demon Sealing Sword’s power. Adding his cultivation base into the attack, he was surprisingly able to block the Great Yao’s attack. Seeing that brought both shock and joy to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was presently only at level 8 of the Concealed stage while this Great Yao was the equivalent of a level 8 Sky Human stage cultivator. The difference between the two levels could practically be described as the difference between Heaven and Earth. And yet, Chen Feng had managed to block the attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Life and death energies!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The black wyrm opened its mouth and a stream of black energy shot out from its mouth. At the same time, a stream of white energy shot out from its horn. The two streams of energies melded together and the surrounding space immediately began shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I cannot block this! This fellow is actually utilizing such a formidable killer move!</span></em><span>&nbsp;With a thought, Chen Feng swiftly hid himself inside the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The resulting explosion created a black hole in space. Next, cracks began spreading out from the black hole and hurricanes kept spinning out from the black hole.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is going on here?” The black wyrm realized that Chen Feng’s aura had disappeared. Thus, a look of shock flashed across its large eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Its formidable soul power scanned its surroundings, but found nothing at all. After giving its surroundings another glance, the black wyrm then dove back into the pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Plop!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Inside the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng had once again jumped into the lightning pool to cultivate himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ten days later, Chen Feng re-appeared above the pool. He stretched his hand out and made a grasping motion. Next, a massive palm silhouette grabbed the pool water. With an abrupt tug, the waters within the pool, weighing hundreds of thousands of jin, were grasped upwards. Then, the massive handful of water smashed down heavily against the pool.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A loud, sky-bursting boom rang out. After merely two breaths’ worth of time, the black wyrm swirled out once again. It did not say anything. Instead, it immediately unleashed a tempestuous attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ice Seal World!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Streams of chilling energy were sprayed out to freeze everything around. Chen Feng’s body turned stiff and even the astral energy he put up around his body began cracking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Remarkable! This is no ordinary chilling energy!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The thought had only just appeared in his mind when the astral energy shield around him suddenly shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The bone-biting chilling energy surged towards Chen Feng’s fleshly body. Even though Chen Feng’s body had been tempered many times before, he could still feel his muscles twitching.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>So cold! My current body is strong enough that I can cultivate using earthen fire. And yet, I am still incapable of fending off this chilling energy!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was shocked. Wisps of flames spread out from his body. Those were the Five Elemental Fire and Eight Trigrams’ Fire that he had cultivated. There was also the power of fire from his body armour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With the protection afforded by the various fire-type powers, Chen Feng began unleashing his skills to fight the black wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After one joss stick’s worth of time, Chen Feng slipped back into the Longevity Tower and the black wyrm’s killer move struck thin air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Roar! Roar! Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Failing to find Chen Feng, the black wyrm became so infuriated that it roared out. Even if the black wyrm was a fool, it would have realized that Chen Feng possessed a very powerful magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After venting its rage for a moment, the black wyrm went back into the pool.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, every 10 days or half a month, Chen Feng would emerge from the Longevity Tower to provoke the black wyrm. Then, after a round of battle, Chen Feng would slip back into the Longevity Tower to continue cultivating himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the beginning, the black wyrm was thoroughly enraged. However, as time went by, it grew accustomed to it. Whenever Chen Feng appeared, the black wyrm would automatically rush out to start a fight, not waiting for Chen Feng to provoke it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the beginning, the black wyrm had wanted to kill off Chen Feng. However, it then understood that the formidable power of Chen Feng’s magic treasure made it so that killing Chen Feng was an impossibility for it. Helpless, it could only fight Chen Feng. Not long after their fight began, the black wyrm would unleash its killer move to force Chen Feng to retreat. It would not be an exaggeration to say that fighting Chen Feng had become part of the black wyrm’s life.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for Chen Feng, after every one of his battles against the black wyrm, his cultivation base would increase by a notch. After cultivating himself within the lightning pool for a while, he would grow eager to jump out and continue the fight.</span></p>
