<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“First, when I am strong enough, I will utilize Soul Shackle to leave a soul brand in your soul to turn you into a puppet that only knows how to do battle,” said Chen Feng calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! With your abilities? Dream on!” Purplebolt roared and he attempted to extricate himself to pounce at Chen Feng. However, the stone stele continued pressing down on him and he could only roar out again and again. His roars could do nothing to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Second, I can keep you suppressed here until the day you die,” said Chen Feng viciously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Which of the two paths will you choose?” Chen Feng smiled as he asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Neither! Eventually, I will escape. When that happens, you will be torn to pieces!” Purplebolt roared out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Actually, there is another path besides those two that you can choose.” Chen Feng suddenly smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, what are you trying to get at?” Purplebolt asked in a solemn tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Willingly open up your soul and let me put a soul brand in there,” said Chen Feng coolly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are dreaming!” Purplebolt bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Originally, I would have waited until my cultivation base is strong enough to subdue you. However, I am now in need of your power. If you do not submit, do not begrudge my methods,” said Chen Feng with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Whatever methods you have, just bring it on. You are just a mere level 2 Concealed stage cultivator. Someone like you cannot break through my defence.” Purplebolt sneered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Is that right? In that case, try this.” Chen Feng suddenly smiled. He reached his hand out and made a grasping motion. Next, following Chen Feng’s instructions, the energy currents within the Longevity Tower quickly condensed. After some time, they condensed into another stone stele, filled with strange-looking patterns on its surface. It seemed as though the patterns had been engraved into the stone stele itself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although I can only access a portion of the Longevity Tower’s power right now, it is still enough against the current you.” After saying that, Chen Feng pressed down with his palm and the one zhang square stone stele pressed down heavily upon the stone stele that was already suppressing the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm’s body (1 zhang = 3.333 m).&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a thudding sound, Purplebolt abruptly felt his body lurching down, as though another mountain was pressing down on him. Originally, he had only been incapable of moving, but now, it felt hard to even breathe.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Good! Good!” Four Ears jumped up and down behind Chen Feng while crying out with his divine sense.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You damned monkey! When I escape, you’re screwed!” Purplebolt shouted furiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You still think you can escape? I told you before, I will be keeping you here until the day you die.” As Chen Feng spoke, he waved his palm once more and another stone stele descended from above to land on the second stone stele like a pyramid.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wo-!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The heavy pressure was such that the Great Yao could not even utter out a wretched howl. Although the stone steles were not large, the enchantments placed upon them by the Longevity Tower made it so each of them was over 1 million jin in weight. Only Purplebolt, who possessed a powerful Great Yao’s body, could handle such a weight. Any other cultivator on the same level as him would have been crushed into meat paste from just one stone stele (1 jin = 0.5 kg).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You little devil. Hurry up and release me, otherwise I will kill you!” All Purplebolt could do was to keep roaring at Chen Feng. Finally, due to the increasingly massive force pressing down on him, even his tough fleshly body began going out of shape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unfortunately for Purplebolt, howling was all he could do at the moment. When he was suppressed back then, his magic powers had been sealed up by Tower. Even though Chen Feng was now standing before him, there was nothing he could do.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The body of a Great Yao is truly strong. However, I would like to see how long you can endure.” After saying that, Chen Feng waved his hand yet again and a third stone stele appeared to press down on Purplebolt’s body. This move elicited a wailing cry from the Great Yao. Immediately, he stopped struggling and instead simply lay there, gasping for breath. Creaking sounds could also be heard coming out from his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt felt his body going out of shape from the weight pressing down on his body. Even breathing was difficult for him. The bones inside his body kept releasing creaking sounds, seemingly on the verge of breaking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had suddenly added three extra stone steles on Purplebolt’s body, each weighing one million jin. Although Purplebolt was not squashed to death by the stone steles, they were enough to put him in a near-death state.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Phew!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng too, breathed a sigh of relief. Creating three stone steles at that moment was the most he could do despite borrowing the Longevity Tower’s power. At the same time, he was also feeling shocked at the might of this Great Yao’s fleshly body. He knew all too well that each of those stone steles was the equivalent of a small mountain. A normal Sky Human stage cultivator pressed under the stone stele would have been reduced to a layer of meat paste.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How does it feel? Are you ready to yield?” Chen Feng moved to stand before Purplebolt and said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm laboured just to open his eyes. A ferocious light glinted across his eyes and he said contemptuously, “You are just borrowing the power of your magic treasure. If you can defeat me using your own power, I will yield.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If I can do that, would I have to do this? If that is how you want it, let’s see how long you can last,” said Chen Feng coolly. After considering it for a moment, he snapped his fingers and a stream of sword energy flowed into the Longevity Tower to flow around Chen Feng’s fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the stream of sword energy appeared unremarkable, the power contained within it caused Four Ears to hastily run far away. Even Purplebolt ended up blinking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is the Overwhelming Astral Sword’s sword energy. Right, it is a Prized artefact. I wonder if it can wound you,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Another thing, although you are a Great Yao who can even kill Sky Human stage cultivators, you have been suppressed here all this time. Even celestial beings would be weakened from that. I wonder how much power do you have left.” After saying that, Chen Feng flicked his finger and the sword energy flashed forward to stab into Purplebolt’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A white mark appeared upon the tough surface of his skin. Forget drawing blood, it was not even half an inch deep.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a magnificent defence! When I rip your skin out, I should be able to forge a very good body armour with it,” said Chen Feng with a smile. Next, two more beams of sword energy appeared on his palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sha! Sha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One after another, the two beams of sword energy struck the white mark and the wound there grew deeper. However, no blood was spilled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Purplebolt roared out furiously once more, wanting to struggle. However, due to the suppressing stone steles, he was simply incapable of moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tsk tsk. What a perverted level of defence. I am thinking how I should pull out your bones and muscles to forge a Prized artefact from them,” Chen Feng continued. Next, he waved his hand once more and five beams of sword energy hovered before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You dare?!” Purplebolt bellowed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sha! Sha! Sha! Sha! Sha!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The five beams of sword energy united into one beam before striking the wound on Purplebolt’s body. Next, purple-coloured blood sprayed out. With a wave of his hand, Chen Feng gathered the blood and quickly formed a clump of blood with them, hovering before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Carefully sensing the mighty power within the blood, Chen Feng compared Purplebolt to the Thunderhawk. In the end, he surmised that Purplebolt was no match for the Thunderhawk.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng then flicked his finger and a droplet of blood separated from the clump of blood to fly towards Four Ears. Sensing the potent energy within the droplet of blood, Four Ears felt both dread and excitement. Next, it opened its mouth and gulped the droplet of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Four Ears released a violent roar, shocking Chen Feng. Its lean stature expanded and every one of its golden-coloured hair stood erect, like steel needles. He looked like a variant hedgehog. Golden light shone off his body and energy currents kept surging around him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Feeling the unstable aura radiating from Four Ears, Chen Feng pondered for a bit before smiling. “It seems this method can allow a yao beast to evolve.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You dare feed my noble blood to a lowly monkey? Are you trying to vex me to my death?!” Purplebolt howled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Since you are unwilling to cooperate, I will rip out your muscles and skin, draw out your blood and let Four Ears refine and absorb them. I wonder, after fully absorbing all of your blood essence, can Four Ears evolve into a Great Yao?” Chen Feng sneered at Purplebolt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Despicable human, you deserve to be struck by lightning and be torn to pieces!” Purplebolt kept howling out, but a trace of fear had begun to appear in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Or perhaps I can raise you like this. I will draw out blood from your body every day. The blood of a Great Yao should have many functions, right? Concocting pills, enhancing magic treasures. Oh, I hear it is a very good material in the concoction of Scarlet Blood Pills,” Chen Feng continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You bastard, just kill me.” After listening to Chen Feng’s words, fear began to fester within the Great Yao’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How could I be willing to kill you? You are a Great Yao that I will be raising. I still need you to constantly provide the blood of a Great Yao for me. How about this? If you can persist for 100 years, I will let you go. What do you think?” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One hundred years? Why don’t you just go die?” Purplebolt felt himself on the verge of going mad.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Here are 100 Magic crystals. Hurry up and absorb their energy to recover yourself. Tomorrow, I will continue extracting more blood.” Chen Feng waved his hand and a portion of the Magic crystals piled up within the Longevity Tower flew over before shoving themselves into Purplebolt’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After that, Chen Feng said nothing else. He simply allowed the clump of blood to hover in the air while his divine sense form transformed into a stream of light before returning to his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh, I don’t believe this Great Yao will not yield after this.” After returning to the outside world, Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Sigh! If not for the fact that this situation is too dangerous, I would not have chosen to do something like this. It does feel quite despicable</span></em><span>. Chen Feng sighed while shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>However, if I can make this Great Yao submit right now, I will have a super expert on my side. The chances of us surviving will grow much higher. Maybe, we can all safely make it out from Demon Soul Valley.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng continued pondering the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, hurry, look up front,” Ye Ziming suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s gaze peered past the thick layers of demonic energy for a bit before speaking up. “So, it is not the silhouette of a mountain. Rather, it is the remains of a large building.”</span></p>
