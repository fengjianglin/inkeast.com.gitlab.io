<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Thousand Seeker Mirror grew increasingly bright and the range of the images shown expanded. Chen Feng could feel the power within his body getting consumed rapidly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>As expected, my cultivation base is still insufficient. I can barely utilize Prized artefacts. The Prized artefacts are like endless pits. Even if I pour in all the power I have into it, I will not be able to unleash its full power,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Suddenly, the images on the mirror flashed and Chen Feng’s eyes lit up. Then, he shouted, “Found it!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let me see.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun gathered around him. There on the mirror was a group of cultivators. They were surrounding and attacking a unique-looking yao beast. The body of the yao beast was filled with line after line of terrifying wounds. Due to their battle, the surrounding trees had broken down. Still, a good number of the cultivators were also wounded. Two torn corpses could be seen on the ground as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That is a Great Yao!” Tie Changkong uttered in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“For so many people to be besieging this Great Yao, there must be a reason for this.” Chen Feng observed carefully and determined that the cultivators were the ones to personally go forward to besiege the Great Yao. As for the Great Yao, it kept trying to charge out of the encirclement. However, due to the high number of cultivators, some possessing Prized artefacts, the Great Yao ended up getting more wounded instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s probably for the sake of some good items. Come, let’s go check it out.” Seeing so many cultivators there, Tie Changkong felt somewhat incapable of holding himself back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wait! Look who’s here?” Chen Feng suddenly laughed. Next, the images on Thousand Seeker Mirror changed, focusing upon a certain spot with thick grasses. Two cultivators maintained cautious postures as they lurked within the grasses, observing the group of cultivators besieging the Great Yao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s Liu Tian and Xu Ziping,” said a surprised Tie Changkong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The two of them clearly have some kind of plan for lurking there. Could they be planning to become the oriole preying on the cicada?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go forward and get a better look. We’ll see just what these two are planning.” Chen Feng could feel the Prized artefact’s incredible rate of magic power consumption. Thus, he slowly retracted some of his power and began to slowly move forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun slowly followed suit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, try this on.” Tie Changkong suddenly produced a palm-sized talisman and handed it to Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Invisibility Talisman!” Chen Feng was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I bought these at a high price. After using it, only cultivators at the Sky Human stage can detect us. Those at the Concealed stage will never be able to detect us,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is a good item.” Chen Feng took the Invisibility Talisman and sent a strand of his soul power into it. Instantly, the Invisibility Talisman released a light so faint, people would normally be incapable of seeing it. Next, Chen Feng disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, both Tie Changkong and Shangguan Yun’s bodies shone with that faint light and all three turned invisible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Do any of you recognize what yao beast that is?” Chen Feng asked using secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No. It looks like a cow. However, its body is covered in scales. Additionally, it only has one horn. There are also strange patterns on its body. It looks like a messy yao beast that is neither this species nor that,” Tie Changkong slowly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One more thing, the yao beast’s tail is very thick. It is also flashing with lightning power. Earlier, one lash from the tail had shattered a magic treasure,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng observed the yao beast that was constantly roaring and charging about through the Thousand Seeker Mirror and said, “There are countless types of yao beasts in the world. We only know a small number of them. Since we do not know its name, let’s call it Messy for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Alright. I believe there must be a reason why they are besieging Messy. It is a Great Yao, after all. I don’t think the cultivators would choose to hunt a Great Yao because they are bored,” Tie Changkong said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although the wounds on Messy’s body appear serious, the wounds on the cultivators’ side are actually more serious. As such, I believe that the reason those cultivators would put their lives at stake to kill this yao beast is for an even better item. It is one that would entice them to put their lives on the line,” said Chen Feng after some consideration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What can that item be?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pa!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Chen Feng’s team was slowly moving forward, Messy’s thick tail struck another cultivator, causing his body to break into pieces. However, in doing so, Messy’s body received another two wounds. The wounds were so deep, even its bones could be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, blood did not flow out from the wounds. Instead, streams of lightning power flashed out. It was as though Messy was not a fleshly entity, but something formed through the condensation of lightning powers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a moment of thought, Tie Changkong said, “Could it be a One-horned Thunderbull?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Tie Changkong recognizes Messy?” Chen Feng grew surprised. He did not expect Tie Changkong to recognize the yao beast.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have never seen it before. However, I did read about it in the books. If I am not mistaken, Messy should be a One-horned Thunderbull,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Every part of this yao beast is a treasure. As I recall, this yao beast’s habitat would always have a high number of True Thunderscour Fruits,” Tie Changkong continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“True Thunderscour Fruit! It is a spirit-type fruit capable of strengthening the fleshly body. To think that it is something like that. If so, I can understand why these cultivators would put their lives on the line to kill this yao beast,” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“True Thunderscour Fruit.” Chen Feng nodded his head and carefully sensed about. It was true. He could sense faint lightning powers within the surrounding streams of spiritual energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Look! Liu Tian and Xu Ziping are on the move,” Chen Feng suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Tian and Xu Ziping, who were hiding within the grasses, suddenly disappeared into thin air. On the Thousand Seeker Mirror, two red dots kept moving forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“They are also using Invisibility Talismans,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thankfully, this Thousand Seeker Mirror is of a high enough grade, otherwise we would be incapable of knowing where they went,” said Chen Feng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do we do now? Do we continue to observe the battle or follow Liu Tian and Xu Ziping?” Shangguan Yun asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Follow Liu Tian. Those two must be going after some treasures,” Tie Changkong quickly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. I agree that we should go see what those two are doing,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Using Invisibility Talismans, Liu Tian and Xu Ziping carefully circled past the cultivators fighting the One-horned Thunderbull. After that, they slowly moved away from the battle. Chen Feng and the others carefully did the same thing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Thankfully, Chen Feng possessed the Thousand Seeker Mirror, otherwise he would have been incapable of keeping up with Liu Tian and Xu Ziping. As someone who had cultivated up to level 9 of the Concealed stage, Liu Tian could surely detect Chen Feng’s team if they got too close to him. Even then, Chen Feng was not feeling confident. He feared that Liu Tian would discover them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s not get too close. Liu Tian’s cultivation base is too high. If a fight erupts, the three of us may not be capable of dealing with him. Not to mention, there is also Xu Ziping,” said Chen Feng through secret vocal transmission.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t worry. There are plenty of cultivators here. Liu Tian does not have the courage to attack us here,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The surrounding lightning powers are getting stronger. It seems there must be True Thunderscour Fruits nearby. It would seem that Liu Tian and Xu Ziping are going to the One-horned Thunderbull’s lair,” Chen Feng said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If Liu Tian and Xu Ziping could find the True Thunderscour Fruits, those cultivators fighting the One-horned Thunderbull should be able to do the same, no?” Shangguan Yun said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are right. There are others besides Liu Tian and Xu Ziping who are secretly on the move.” After saying that, Chen Feng tapped the Thousand Seeker Mirror. The viewing angle of the images playing on the Thousand Seeker Mirror changed to reveal two cultivators covered entirely in sword light. Judging by their movements, they shared the same objective as Liu Tian and Xu Ziping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng controlled the Thousand Seeker Mirror to constantly change its viewing angle. It did not take long for them to discover several more cultivators sneaking around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This seems like a really lively place. If those cultivators fighting the One-horned Thunderbull find out that there are people plundering their burning house, would they puke out blood due to anger?” Chen Feng said with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I think so.” Tie Changkong grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“True Thunderscour Fruit!” Suddenly, Chen Feng’s team heard a hushed cry of shock. After that, a chaotic burst of voices rose up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It really is True Thunderscour Fruit?” Tie Changkong uttered with joy and surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The fruit known as True Thunderscour Fruit held an enticing power over all the cultivators in the world of cultivation. Its effect of enhancing the fleshly body alone would lead countless cultivators into conflict and intense bloodshed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A series of clashing sounds quickly rang out. Some shouts could also be heard.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Everyone, don’t attack. There are plenty of True Thunderscour Fruits here. There is enough for us to share.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bullshit! There is no such thing as too many good stuff. We are the ones who first saw these True Thunderscour Fruits. They are ours!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are the one who is bullshitting! Might makes right!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s attack as well! Those are True Thunderscour Fruits. My body currently requires strengthening.” Tie Changkong was almost incapable of holding himself back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I have something I want to ask you two.” Chen Feng suddenly changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is it?” Tie Changkong grew puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you think is the fastest way of earning money?” There was a rather odd smile on Chen Feng’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That? Probably robbery. That is a transaction that doesn’t require capital,” Tie Changkong said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Could you be planning on-” Shangguan Yun’s eyes lit up, a look of surprise etched on her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. However, robbery is not a transaction that doesn’t require capital. Without strength, we will be the ones to die. Rather than going forward to participate in a fight to the death, we might as well wait for them to finish snatching before rushing forward to deal with them one by one,” said Chen Feng with a composed tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Aren’t you being too sinister?” There was a slightly odd look on Tie Changkong’s face as he regarded Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey, is it sinister? This world is originally one where the strong preys on the weak. The end justifies the means. Don’t tell you two have never done something like this before?” said Chen Feng with an icy grin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Unexpectedly, after hearing Chen Feng’s words, neither Tie Changkong nor Shangguan Yun refuted him. It would appear they were admitting to it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fine, then. We’ll wait. At any rate, you possess the Thousand Seeker Mirror. There is no need to fear we’ll lose them. However, since we’ve decided to do this, we must not hold back. We need to cleanly finish off our enemies,” said Tie Changkong with a cold and stern tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Naturally. However, Brother Tie, from the sound of it, you have done this quite a bit in the past?” Chen Feng deliberately grinned.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! Doing something like this once in a while does bring about some feelings. Enough chatter. Let’s see what Liu Tian and Xu Ziping are doing,” Tie Changkong said with a chortle.</span></p>
