 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng knew that it would be difficult for the magic treasures to level up. Even so, he tossed them into the lightning pool anyways to have them undergo a tempering process using the Sky Lightning powers. At the very least, it would be beneficial towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Besides, some of the magic treasures were at the threshold for levelling up. They might actually be able to level up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After utilizing the Longevity Tower, Chen Feng stopped paying attention to the pouring waves of Sky Lightning. Instead, he began healing his wounds and temper his fleshly body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s been so long, but the Lightning Tribulation is still not over. Did something happen?” Immortal Scarletflame frowned. Waves of Sky Lightning continued to descend like a river. Immortal Scarletflame had already made the calculations. The amount of Sky Lightning powers there was sufficient to scorch an area spanning a radius of 50 kilometres. Caught in the middle of it all, even a Human Immortal would be torn to shreds. If it weren’t for the fact that there was something constantly devouring all the Sky Lightning powers within the barrier, even the barrier – erected with the combined powers of four Human Immortals – would be incapable of handling it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng ignored all of that, continuing to let Tower secretly handle the rest. At any rate, Sky Lightning was a rare form of energy for him. It was of a far higher grade compared to the spiritual energy that he could usually absorb during cultivation. For cultivators practicing lightning-type cultivation techniques, Sky Lightning was most invaluable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s about time to end this. Let’s end this here. We’ve stirred too much of a commotion this time. If we are to plunder from Heaven again next time, we’ll have to find a remote location. Or perhaps, we should head to outer space,” Tower said. Next, the cascading waves of Sky Lightning abruptly disappeared. It was as though a door within the sky had been abruptly shut tight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, a wave of profound aura descended upon Chen Feng’s body. Due to that, Chen Feng grunted. His sea of wisdom fell into a state of turmoil and his head was racked with so much pain that it felt as though it would burst apart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>That was the will of the world, the laws that came after a Lightning Tribulation. However, the laws that appeared this time around were over 100 times stronger than the previous one, far stronger. It was such that Chen Feng felt as though his sea of wisdom was incapable of handling the laws.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, what is going on here?” Chen Feng struggled to say.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, enjoy yourself! This is the result of me interfering with the Lightning Tribulation earlier. Since so much Sky Lightning fell earlier, it is only right for a corresponding number of worldly laws to descend as well. He he! I will not be helping you for this. You will have to rely on yourself for this,” Tower cackled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng gritted his teeth to endure. He no longer had the strength to talk. He had to labour arduously to digest the worldly laws. He felt thankful. Thankfully, he had already cultivated out his Lifebound Flame. Thankfully, his sea of wisdom was large enough. Thankfully, he had cultivated the Soul Subduing Mantra, causing his soul to become as stable as a rock. If it weren’t for all that, the worldly laws would have overloaded his sea of wisdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite the incredibly unbearable feeling, Chen Feng sensed that he could digest all the worldly laws descending upon him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, some time will be needed for that.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Lightning Tribulation ended and Chen Feng slowly sat down cross-legged on the ground, both his eyes closed tightly. The wounds on his body were healing up at a rate visible to the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng sat in the middle of a massive, circular crater. The mountains around had all disappeared, flattened by the Lightning Tribulation. Naturally, if it weren’t for the barrier, the crater would be even bigger than this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian was the first to arrive before Chen Feng. Regarding his surroundings, he could not stop a wry smile from appearing on his face. If his mountain residence was the only one flattened, it would have been all right. However, the other disciples whose mountains were flattened by the Lightning Tribulation would surely never let this slide.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Four Human Immortals appeared before Chen Feng. Observing Chen Feng, who was seated cross-legged on the ground, the four of them revealed interested looks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Greetings, seniors!” Jian Xiaotian immediately saluted them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, it is Senior Daybreak’s apprentice.” Immortal Scarletflame and the other three Human Immortals nodded, smiling at Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Although the four of them were also Human Immortals, they were far inferior when compared to Jian Xiaotian’s master.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After a moment’s consideration, Immortal Scarletflame asked, “This Chen Feng is your friend, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes, he is junior’s friend. Not just that, he is also an honorary elder of our sect,” Jian Xiaotian answered cautiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha, no need to worry! We mean him to harm. Since he is an honorary elder of our sect, he is as good as a member of our sect. It’s just the destruction of a few mountains, no big deal!” Immortal Scarletflame laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Jian Xiaotian breathed a sigh of relief. The destruction wrought about from Chen Feng’s tribulation was very big. Should the sect insist on pursuing this matter, there would be nothing that Jian Xiaotian could do about it. Although he had a formidable master, his master was not someone who would care about something like this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The four Human Immortals kept regarding Chen Feng, seemingly wanting to see through Chen Feng with their gazes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seemingly triggered by the oppressive atmosphere from the four gazes, a wave of blood energy emerged from the top of Chen Feng’s head before swiftly forming a reddish, transparent barrier. The barrier stopped the four Human Immortals from probing Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Oh? The aura of a Dao artefact! So, this fellow truly does possess a high-grade magic treasure.” Immortal Scarletflame and the other three Human Immortals were taken aback. However, they quickly recollected themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Immortal Scarletflame turned to Jian Xiaotian and said, “After your friend wakes up, tell him to come meet us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the four Human Immortals left.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng continued comprehending the worldly laws. With the Blood Mustering Bead to protect him, Chen Feng was not worried about any potential dangers. Besides, there was also the highly unfathomable Longevity Tower to protect him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen underwent another tribulation?” Liu Quan and the others arrived. They were outside the sect earlier and had only just returned not too long ago. Upon their return, they were immediately attracted by the commotion.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Jian Xiaotian nodded, sighing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“All this was caused by the tribulation?” Liu Quan looked around, a look of disbelief on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes.” Jian Xiaotian nodded again, a lamenting look on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng spent one whole month on this cultivation session while Jian Xiaotian and the others took turns to protect him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Liu Quan and the others were very worried that assassins from Killer Palace would come and attempt to assassinate Chen Feng. However, one month swiftly went by without any incidents involving assassins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After waking up, Chen Feng felt happy. Then, he saw his surroundings and his face abruptly sank.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>All of this was caused by me. As expected! Tower, this is all your fault! If only I had known, I would have sent all that Sky Lightning into the Longevity Tower right from the start!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng grumbled at Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower, on the other hand, ignored his complaints. Seeing that, Chen Feng felt even more frustrated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, congratulations! You have successfully overcome your Lightning Tribulation. You are now a level 5 Sky Human stage cultivator. You really do prepare thoroughly before charging forward. I am now only at level 6 of the Sky Human stage,” Jian Xiaotian stepped forward and said, laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Yes. Congratulations, Brother Chen. It seems you are probably capable of fighting against a Human Immortal now,” Liu Quan said smilingly as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fellows, no need to overpraise me. I am aware of my limitations. By borrowing my magic treasures, I should be able to fight against a Human Immortal for a bit. However, if I have to depend solely on my own strength, I would likely be no match for you guys.” Chen Feng waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, you are too modest. Magic treasures are also part of your strength.” Situ Nan laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen.” Suddenly, the one who had utilized the Eye of the Void, Senior Brother Ye, flew over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He is Ye Ziwen. He is only half a step away from the Human Immortal stage. He practices the Eye of the Void and the Myriad Swords Assembly Technique. He is very powerful. Additionally, he also has a good character. He has a very high reputation within our sect and is also one of the contenders for the next Sect Master position.” Liu Quan swiftly leaned over to inform Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Greetings!” Without waiting for them to speak up, Ye Ziwen smiled and greeted them. He gave off the impression of a spring breeze.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Ye, you are too polite.” Liu Quan and the others nodded in response. The group led by Ye Ziwen was bigger than Liu Quan’s group. However, the relationship between their two groups was only average and there was nothing special between them. Thus, Liu Quan and the others knew that Ye Ziwen was here for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is Elder Chen, right?” Ye Ziwen turned to look at Chen Feng, his eyes as deep as the sea. It was a pair of eyes which could entrance others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Ye.” Chen Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not bad. You are truly talented. This is my first time meeting someone as talented as Brother Chen,” Ye Ziwen said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Ye, you overpraise me.” Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ye Ziwen chatted with them for a while before bidding farewell. “Very well, I will not be disturbing you fellows. Let’s meet again when we have the time.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This Ye Ziwen is very powerful. The eye technique he cultivates is especially powerful. The way I see it, he will be able to reach the Human Immortal stage soon enough,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha! The reason Ye Ziwen came over to chat with us is because he wants to recruit you,” Jian Xiaotian said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am just an insignificant character. What worth is there in recruiting me?” Chen Feng laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You may be an insignificant character right now. However, that might not remain true in the future. Besides, your reputation in the world of cultivation rings louder than ours.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“By the way, Senior Scarletflame and some other seniors want to meet you,” Liu Quan suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Me? A Human Immortal?” Chen Feng was somewhat shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You only have yourself to blame for causing too much of a commotion.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng headed over to a somewhat ordinary-looking mountain to meet the four Human Immortals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The mountain was not particularly tall and there were not many trees growing on its surface. In fact, it did not even have a decent spiritual tree. There were only common rocks scattered around the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After approaching the mountain, however, Chen Feng sensed a scorching sword intent coming from the mountain. Upon entering the mountain, he felt a very powerful atmosphere of oppression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is where Senior Scarletflame cultivates. I won’t be entering,” said Liu Quan smilingly. He was the one who led Chen Feng over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Master is waiting for you at the top of the mountain.” After stepping foot upon the mountain, Chen Feng encountered a cultivator. He looked to be younger than Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Judging by his aura, this cultivator is indeed younger than me. However, he has already reached level 6 of the Sky Human stage. He can already be considered a top genius in the world of cultivation</span></em><span>. Just one glance was all Chen Feng needed to determine the cultivator’s cultivation base.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng stepped forward, he could feel the surrounding sword intent growing stronger. By the time he was halfway up the mountain, he was already feeling the urge to puke blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An invisible sword intent filled the surrounding space, giving Chen Feng the feeling that there were ten thousand swords around him. More importantly, there was this feeling, of something assailing and oppressing his soul. A cultivator with lesser willpower would have given up and run away from the mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
