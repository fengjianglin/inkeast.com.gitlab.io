 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Domain!” Chen Feng’s power burst out violently and his domain power swirled around him. Thunder and lightning rumbled, water and fire melded together, the positions of Heaven and Earth shifted and the mountains and lakes kept circling around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Energy Domain!” Jian Xiaotian, too, released his domain. Additionally, his domain was even bigger compared to Chen Feng’s domain. Sword beams rampaged about within every corner of his domain. It was a world of swords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This was the first time Chen Feng had laid eyes on Jian Xiaotian’s domain power. Thus, he felt somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Today, I will show you fellows the great immortal techniques of our Transcendent Firmaments Palace!” The face of the cultivator turned grim and swirling winds began gathering around him. Shockingly, it seemed as though the swirling winds were formed using immortal energy and various mysterious runes kept flashing out within them. The fabric of the world seemed to intertwine as a dangerous aura surged into the hearts of Chen Feng, Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ohoh? This is actually an immortal technique! Tsk, tsk! Although it is of a very low grade, the fact that this little runt can utilize an immortal technique means he must be a top disciple from Transcendent Firmaments Palace,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Careful! Looks like he can utilize immortal techniques! This is unexpected!” said Lin Shaokun, who raised his staff. Next, the staff seemingly transformed into a sky-reaching divine weapon before slamming heavily down on the cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The mysterious runes around the cultivator abruptly revealed themselves to bounce Lin Shaokun’s staff back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha ha ha! Remember this! The one who killed you is Ling Yifei, the genius disciple from Transcendent Firmaments Palace!” The cultivator laughed loudly as streams of potent energy began swelling out from his body to encroach upon his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang! Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two fist silhouettes, formed entirely of energy, bombarded Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian. The two fists shot forward with extreme speed and both Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian found themselves incapable of blocking the attacks. Thus, they were both sent flying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crash! Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian kept tumbling backwards in a wretched manner. There was no telling just how many trees were smashed apart by their tumbling figures.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ling Yifei’s figure flashed forward to re-appear before Jian Xiaotian. He then extended his hand forward to grab Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Scram!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lin Shaokun’s attack arrived just in time and it swung furiously towards Ling Yifei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>With a grip, Ling Yifei easily grabbed hold of Lin Shaokun’s staff. A force of half a million kilogrammes was actually incapable of even moving Ling Yifei’s palm. Next, immortal energy quaked out from Ling Yifei’s palm and magic power abruptly shot out to deform Lin Shaokun’s staff.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sii!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite exerting all his strength, Lin Shaokun was still incapable of pulling back his staff. He felt as though it was a mighty 10,000-year-old mountain before him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ling Yifei waved his hand and Lin Shaokun felt as though he had been struck by lightning. As for the staff in his hand, it flew away, disappearing from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Pu!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Badly wounded, Lin Shaokun coughed out blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Unity of man and sword!” The will to fight continued to fill Jian Xiaotian’s body. However, the difference between them was too big. With just one clash, Jian Xiaotian was sent flying. It was unknown if he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, why is this fellow’s immortal technique so powerful?” asked Chen Feng, who was feeling vexed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s just a smidgen of it. Truth be told, it still cannot be considered as an immortal technique,” Tower said scornfully.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, I get the feeling that it is even stronger than the Longevity Scripture,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Horseshit! Apeshit! Bullshit!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower suddenly flew into a fit of rage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What do you know? Even if this fellow’s immortal technique is 1,000 times stronger, no, even if it is 10,000 times stronger, it still cannot match the Longevity Scripture!” Tower roared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“However, the present situation is as clear as day. This fellow is just too powerful,” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bah! That’s because your cultivation level is not high enough. You don’t need much. Just overcome 1 Lightning Tribulation. Then, any one of the magic techniques within the Longevity Scripture can easily wallop this bugger,” Tower said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The main point here is that I have not overcome Lightning Tribulation,” Chen Feng replied with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Hey, hey! Little fellow, you haven’t even overcome Lightning Tribulation. And yet, your fleshly body is so strong that you can even block my attacks. However, I will be killing you in one hit now!” Ling Yifei’s figure flashed forward, arriving before Chen Feng. Potent energy streams erupted from him, creating a terrifying spectacle. Next, he pulled his hand back and unleashed a space-shattering punch at Chen Feng’s chest, wanting to break Chen Feng’s body to pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Force acupoint, activate!” Chen Feng bellowed. Instantly, a formidable force surged through every part of Chen Feng’s body. Next, Chen Feng felt as though the God of Might had taken over his body, causing all the muscles in his body to swell up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two punches collided and Chen Feng was once again sent flying. All the muscles and bones within him trembled without respite. Chen Feng had taken a loss in the clash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Thankfully, my body armour could weaken 80 % of the power behind his attack. However, it would appear that my fleshly body is still not strong enough,</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ling Yifei finally revealed a look of surprise. Although he did not exert his all for the punch, even a cultivator with 4 Lightning Tribulations under his belt would be incapable of taking the punch. Rather, the cultivator would die from it. And yet, this minor Concealed stage cultivator managed to block it?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How is this possible? I am using an immortal technique!” Ling Yifei was in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Domain Palm!” After steadying himself, Chen Feng did not falter. He attacked once again and a palm silhouette formed using his domain power rumbled as it rammed towards Ling Yifei.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Immortal technique! Transcendent Palm of Heavenly Origin!” Potent energy erupted non-stop from Ling Yifei’s body and an even bigger palm silhouette blasted forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The grounds quaked and the mountains shook. Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian, who had just returned, were immediately smashed far away by the shockwaves. A huge crater with a radius of over 100 zhang appeared on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s go!” Chen Feng swiftly emerged from the chaos to grab both Lin Shaokun and Jian Xiaotian before rushing away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time Ling Yifei emerged from the chaos, Chen Feng’s team of three had disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! You want to run? Not so fast!” Killing intent filled Ling Yifei’s face. Stretching his hand out, he grabbed space and began analysing the auras left by Chen Feng and the others. After just half a breath’s worth of time, Ling Yifei began his pursuit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Surface wise, it would appear that Ling Yifei had the upper hand in the fight. However, he was secretly feeling apprehensive. The immortal technique he used had over exhausted his strength. Once the duration was over, Ling Yifei would become abnormally weak. Thus, Ling Yifei wanted to capture Chen Feng’s team of three as fast as possible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After rushing forward through over 1,000 zhang, Ling Yifei opened his mouth and roared, summoning his companions as he continued chasing after Chen Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like those sects have sent their experts here,” Jian Xiaotian said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We were careless. Forget the loose cultivators, just those from Nine Firmaments Palace, Transcendent Firmaments Palace and Purple Firmaments Palace are beyond what we can handle,” Chen Feng said, panting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The earlier exchange of blows with Ling Yifei had been hard on Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At that moment, they were going back to their valley residence. They planned on returning to the valley and recover before planning their next move. If they were to continue fighting now, the three of them would surely end up falling in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where do you think you’re going? Get down!” Two great trees abruptly exploded as two blade beams slashed towards Chen Feng’s team of three, one from the left and one from the right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Courting death!” Chen Feng stretched his hand out to grab one of the blade beams. Next, he hastily rushed forward and a blade cultivator died to Chen Feng’s grip.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The other cultivator died under Lin Shaokun’s staff attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If you’re going to launch a sneak attack, don’t create a ruckus. Do you have a death wish?” Jian Xiaotian said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Thousand-fold Dragon Capturing Net!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Several nets descended to envelop the area that Chen Feng’s team was in, encompassing a radius of 100 metres. As the net descended, waves of restraining power with a sticky quality spread into the surrounding space. In the face of this power, the surrounding trees crumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity Blade!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng swung and beams of energy shot forward to tear the layers of net into fragments.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity Lance!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand again and several Longevity Lances shot forward. Next, a wretched cry rang out and someone fell from the sky only to die to a punch from Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Solo Skyshock Sword!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They had only just broken through the net when another sword beam erupted from the sky. The one sword beam instantly transformed into hundreds of sword beams. Furthermore, the power behind the move was gradually growing stronger. The scope of the attack grew and the sword beams became sharper even as the sword intent emanating from the attack grew more tangible. Sensing that, Chen Feng’s team of three were shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity Shield!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A huge shield appeared above their heads. Next, Chen Feng displayed the power of earth to bring Jian Xiaotian and Lin Shaokun 10 zhang underground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There was no moment of suspense. The Longevity Shield that Chen Feng condensed out was instantly broken into pieces by the sword beams. It was as though it was made using water. Next, due to the bombardment of the sky-encompassing sword beams, the ground itself began incinerating away to quickly reveal Chen Feng’s team of three.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Remarkable! What a potent sword energy!” Jian Xiaotian exclaimed. However, this also aroused his will to fight. Disregarding Chen Feng’s obstruction, Jian Xiaotian flew up and the great sword flew out from his hand to slash towards a cultivator hovering in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the face of Jian Xiaotian’s attack, the cultivator formed a sword-shaped hand seal before extending his hand to jab at the great sword. Next, Jian Xiaotian’s body shook and the great sword he sent out flew back towards him instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s face sank. With a thought, Bloody Soul shot forward, transforming into a bloody beam of light to crash against the great sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The great sword was deflected as a result and it thrust deep into the ground, disappearing from sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“That was too dangerous!” Chen Feng said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian raised his hand and the great sword flew out from the ground and into his grip. However, he then coughed out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’ve heard that you are from the Central Plains’ Heavenly Sword Faction. The way I see it, you don’t look like much. Are the cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction only this strong?” The cultivator jumped down. He looked at Chen Feng’s team of three with a faint sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng regarded him closely and saw that the cultivator was completely enveloped in sword luminescence. There were even two sword silhouettes spinning non-stop within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A thought came to Chen Feng and he asked, “A pure sword cultivator. You are from Sword Hall?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sword Hall, Bai Jianlei,” the cultivator said calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I didn’t think that someone from Sword Hall would come. Looks like the rewards Nine Firmaments Palace offered are very tempting. However, you are a level 6 Sky Human stage cultivator while Brother Jian is only a level 2 Sky Human stage cultivator. Tsk, tsk, to be putting on airs while bullying the weak, is everyone from Sword Hall like you? In that case, people will surely look down on your sect,” Chen Feng said with a scoff.</span></p>
