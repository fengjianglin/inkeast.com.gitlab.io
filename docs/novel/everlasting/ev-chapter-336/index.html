 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Skywheel Shattersword!” Jian Xiaotian rushed forward and bellowed. Next, the great sword piercing the Wolf King’s body exploded. Although the move failed to blow up the Wolf King’s body, it left a horrifying and bloody hole upon its body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Wolf King howled furiously and a wind blast rapidly shot out from it mouth to strike Jian Xiaotian’s body. Chen Feng, who had just gotten up, saw Jian Xiaotian hurtling like a meteor into the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are fine?” Seeing Chen Feng stand in front of it, the Wolf King immediately howled out in rage once again. This time, a clear tone of disbelief could be heard within its howl.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>An attack with the Wolf King’s full power behind it was something that not even a cultivator with 4 to 5 Lightning Tribulations could block. How could this minor cultivator remain unscathed?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Due to its feelings of rage, the rate at with the Wolf King bled increased.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Demonic Heavengorging Art!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng swiftly spread open both palms and two black-coloured vortexes appeared in the centre of each palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In this situation, the overbearing Demonic Heavengorging Art was more suitable. Next, two pillars of blood sprayed out from the Wolf King’s wound to flow into Chen Feng’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another hurricane had suddenly appeared to sweep Chen Feng up. Before Chen Feng’s figure could land, a group of Silver-winged Gale Wolves was already charging forward to besiege Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Several sword beams shot out from Chen Feng’s body and the Silver-winged Gale Wolves charging at him were all killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>While defending himself, Chen Feng felt puzzled. Why didn’t the Wolf King use this opportunity to attack him? Although the Wolf King was seriously wounded, it was not at the level where it could no longer attack.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only after landing did Chen Feng understand why. The Wolf King had fled, its body transforming into a beam of silvery light as it sped far away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He ran off?” Chen Feng was shocked. However, he quickly understood. The attack from Jian Xiaotian must have grievously wounded the Wolf King. Sensing that it was in danger, the Wolf King decided against continuing the fight. Not to mention, Chen Feng’s impression of indestructibility had also put fear in the Wolf King’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was about to give chase when Jian Xiaotian’s beefy body flew forward once more. On his way forward, he killed several more of the Silver-winged Gale Wolves that were blocking his way.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>He is fine as well. Looks like he doesn’t just possess a formidable fleshly body.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng felt slightly shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Jian Xiaotian stretched his hand into the sky and performed a grasping motion. Motes of luminescence flashed about in the sky and the sword fragments left from the earlier explosion gathered up to re-form Jian Xiaotian’s great sword.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Chase! The Wolf King is wounded. This is a good opportunity!” Jian Xiaotian stepped on his great sword and rode it to pursue the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not hesitate. A stream of light shone beneath his feet and he sped after Jian Xiaotian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not feel concerned. He did not believe the Wolf King could escape. Moreover, he had already utilized his Thousand Seeker Mirror to lock on to the Wolf King’s aura. Unless the Wolf King could quickly put a distance of over 500 kilometres between their two sides, it cannot escape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even so, the Silver-winged Gale Wolf innately possessed the gift of speed. Not to mention, this was the Wolf King. Although it was wounded, the threat of death stimulated its potential instead, giving it a movement speed surpassing its prior limits.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian had to kill their way out from the encirclement of Silver-winged Gale Wolves. By the time they succeeded, the Wolf King had long since disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Shouldn’t these wolves disperse after their king is gone? It doesn’t seem to be the case here,” Chen Feng blurted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You are talking about ordinary wolves. These are yao beasts with spiritual attributes. That Wolf King in particular, has already overcome several Lightning Tribulations,” Jian Xiaotian said, not slowing down in the slightest. Instead, he sped up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Jian Xiaotian flying in the same direction as the Wolf King, Chen Feng knew that Jian Xiaotian had his own means of tracking the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two of them furiously pursued the Wolf King. Finally, after covering a distance of over 500 kilometres, they stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Wolf King’s aura, which was just up ahead earlier, had suddenly disappeared. Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, the two of them had been using their tracking methods to give chase. As their vision were limited, they could not see what was happening on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When they landed, they found that the ground was still covered with a dense number of weeds. Additionally, they appeared even taller and more vibrant. However, there were no other plants in sight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>When Chen Feng’s feet made contact with the ground however, several barbed vines slithered towards Chen Feng at an extreme velocity. They were practically darting forward like snakes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng did not move. Instead, he allowed the vines to wrap tightly around himself. After that, Chen Feng could sense the vines tightening. At the same time, the thorns on the vines began piercing his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s body released a pulse, causing energy currents to surge and the barbed vines wrapping his body were broken into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing that left Chen Feng slightly surprised. He had assumed that his burst of magic power could have utterly shattered the vines. Unexpectedly, he had only managed to break them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a resilient plant. I do not know the name of this vine. However, judging by its looks, once it wraps itself around someone, it will attempt to suck that someone dry,” Jian Xiaotian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even as he spoke, Jian Xiaotian unleashed rays of sword energy to slash the surrounding grasses and vines into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It seems Brother Jian is not too horribly wounded,” Chen Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen, you jest. I was indeed wounded earlier. Truth be told, our actions of pursuing the Wolf King is quite risky. If another Great Yao appears, I will be incapable of dealing with it,” Jian Xiaotian said with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was about to say something when a bout of weakness overcame his body. Involuntarily, his body staggered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen! What happened?” Jian Xiaotian hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Why did this feeling of weakness take so long to manifest this time around?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Idiot. Didn’t you devour the Wolf King’s blood essence earlier? If it were not for that, would you even have the strength to chase it?” Tower spontaneously retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Right. I forgot about that.” Chen Feng felt ashamed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is due to the secret technique I utilized earlier. Right now, my entire body is in an over exhausted state.” After saying that, Chen Feng sat down. Taking out a Pure Essence Pill, he shoved it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Since taking the Pure Essence Pills concocted using the flesh of the Two-headed Icefire Wyrm, Chen Feng had lost his appetite for ordinary medicinal pills. The Pure Essence Pill he took right now was none other than the grade 8 Earthen-tier pill. It was sufficient for him to recover his power. However, time was still needed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng sat down and regulated his rate of breathing, appearing defenceless. He wanted to see if Jian Xiaotian would attack him. If Jian Xiaotian were to attack him, he would have to bring out the Longevity Tower to kill him off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Hopefully, Jian Xiaotian is not that kind of fellow,&nbsp;</span></em><span>Chen Feng thought. Although he had only just met Jian Xiaotian, he did have a good impression of him. Jian Xiaotian had a straightforward, steady, imposing, passionate and talented character. He was someone that everyone would like to befriend.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Very well, Brother Chen. You can recover with peace of mind. I will protect you.” After saying that, Jian Xiaotian thrust his great sword into the ground and carefully observed their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It seems there won’t be an issue.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heh! His wounds are pretty severe as well. However, he does possess the Absolute Combat Constitution. His ability to recover is very strong,” Tower said with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng took one Pure Essence Pill and absorbed the energy of several Prized crystals. It took him two hours before he could stand up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Prized crystals did not merely contain far more spiritual energy compared to Magic crystals. More importantly was the grade of the spiritual energy contained within. After absorbing the energy of Prized crystals, the desire to not absorb the energy of Magic crystals again rose up within Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>At the same time, Chen Feng came to understand why the Longevity Tower chose not to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy to recover. First disregard whether or not the spiritual energy of this world was enough to satisfy the Longevity Tower, the grade of the spiritual energy alone was insufficient for the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng stand up, Jian Xiaotian felt relieved. He directly plopped to the ground, his chest heaving up and down. The rate at which he was breathing increased and it did not take long for the surrounding spiritual energy to converge and flow into Jian Xiaotian’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Heh! This fellow is so trusting of me?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Humph! Do you think everyone else is as cautious as you?” Tower shot a barbed remark at him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“He he! Nothing wrong with exercising caution. I only have one life, after all,” Chen Feng responded with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another two hours passed by before Jian Xiaotian stood up. By then, Chen Feng was more or less fully recovered. Only his soul power remained slightly weak.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After sensing carefully, Jian Xiaotian said, “Could the Wolf King have escaped?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It is strange. The Wolf King should be nearby, but I cannot locate it at all.” Chen Feng himself was feeling puzzled. Despite channelling his full power into the Thousand Seeker Mirror, he could not locate the Wolf King’s aura.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Could this place be its lair?” Jian Xiaotian guessed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe there is something here. The Wolf King ran all the way here. Firstly, it must be able to help it avoid danger. Secondly, it must be able to help it recover.” Chen Feng speculated as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Let’s look around. Grievously wounding a high-level Great Yao had not been easy. We cannot simply let it escape.” After saying that, Jian Xiaotian utilized a searching technique to search their surroundings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian speculated that they were truly within the Seven Kills Direlands now. Their surrounding atmosphere was very peculiar. Although there were no mists or anything like it around them, their vision had become even more limited. Whenever they attempted to peer ahead, space itself would seemingly turn blurry, giving them a peculiar sensation.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng and Jian Xiaotian split up to search separately. Chen Feng brought out the Thousand Seeker Mirror, placing it on his palm as he spurred it. However, as his soul power had yet to fully recover, the Thousand Seeker Mirror’s ability fell considerably.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had only just covered a short distance before barbed vines obstructed his path again. Furthermore, like a coil of snakes, the vines attacked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In the beginning, Chen Feng had wanted to repeat the same move he used earlier, unleashing his magic power once the vines had wrapped around him. However, his eyes suddenly glinted and he immediately changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Opening his palm, Chen Feng sent the Overwhelming Astral Sword to circle around. After making a few circles, it created rays of sword light all around Chen Feng and the vines attacking Chen Feng were cut into pieces before scattering all over the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng waved his hand and several cut snakes that were of the same colour as the vines floated up into the air. A stench flowed out from their bodies.</span></p>
