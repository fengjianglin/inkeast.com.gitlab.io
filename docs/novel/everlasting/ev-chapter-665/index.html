 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Maybe something will happen,” Chen Feng said. Regardless if others could collect it or not, the broken sword will be his.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, that was all due to the existence of the Longevity Tower. If it weren’t for that, Chen Feng would not have the confidence in collecting the broken sword. He could feel the formidable atmosphere of oppression emanating from the broken sword. It was simply that powerful.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Rather, forget collecting the broken sword, even approaching the broken sword was an issue.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Those two fellows actually came as well. How troublesome! If only we had known this would happen, we would have attacked to finish them off.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Seeing Chen Feng and Wen Shaoxiu, killing intent glinted across the eyes of the three cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Senior Brother Wen!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing the arrival of Wen Shaoxiu and Chen Feng, two cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction who were there immediately saluted them. There were looks of delight on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng aside, their Heavenly Sword Faction now had three half-step Human Immortals. Additionally, there were several more cultivators there that were allied with them. Thus, the two cultivators felt more confident with the force that they can field.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So, Junior Brother Wang and Junior Brother Tianxing are here as well. What is going on here?” Wen Shaoxiu asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We were not the first to discover this broken sword. However, the cultivators who first discovered this broken sword did not die in battle. Rather, they died trying to collect this broken sword.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This broken sword is definitely an Immortal artefact. Additionally, it is not something that the other Immortal artefact fragments could compare against. It is at least half an Immortal artefact! Most importantly, although this broken sword is ferociously overbearing, there are certain weak points in the sword beams it radiates. In fact, there are also certain intervals in between the waves of sword beams. Earlier, two cultivators nearly made it only to fail during the final stage. In the end, not even a speck of ash was left of their corpses.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction, Wang Xinglong and Ren Tianxing, quickly said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Hearing that, Wen Shaoxiu’s eyes lit up. “So, there are times when the sword beams are weak. In other words, there is a small chance.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Looks like we’ll have to undergo a bloody battle.” The cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect joined forces with those from Divine Demon Grotto and some others to form a group.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha, that’s right! We’ll finish off these obstructing fellows first.” Wen Shaoxiu laughed loudly, his will to fight surging.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>There were other cultivators besides those aligned with Heavenly Sword Faction and Heartless Heaven Sect. These few cultivators were relatively weak. Thus, seeing the two sides getting into a conflict, they smirked inwardly as they retreated, hoping that both sides would fight to the death so that they could take advantage of them in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Something is amiss. Don’t rush to attack first!” Chen Feng suddenly gave a warning cry.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“There is indeed something amiss. Hurry up and back away!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wen Shaoxiu and the others were pure sword cultivators. They had instantly sensed that something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Something was happening to the broken sword. The spots of blood staining the surface of the sword began growing bright and the massive sword seemingly quivered. Then, followed by an overwhelming burst of sword intent, an unending wave of sword beams and astral swords swept out into its surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Every one of the sword beams flew forward with varying, unpredictable styles. Some were moving in a straight line, upright and strong, some were swirling forward, some were like the blazing fire, some were like a stretch of forest, some were like a gust of wind and some were like sea waves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Some were like the tempestuous lightning and some were as soft as the rain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Streams of sword intent sprayed out all around and the sword beams discharged kept transforming as various concepts relating to the sword began emerging in a fleeting manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wen Shaoxiu shouted. Ignoring the guys from Heartless Heaven Sect, he retreated, covering a distance of over 100 metres in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The two cultivators from Heavenly Sword Faction and the Wang Family rapidly retreated as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They possessed a high understanding towards swords. Thus, they were able to sense an intense feeling of crisis from the sword, one capable of killing them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>On the other hand, Chen Feng deliberately moved slower. He wanted to experience the power that this broken sword was emanating. Besides, even if he were to fail to block the sword beams, there was still the Longevity Tower, his greatest trump card.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The cultivators on Heartless Heaven Sect’s side were slower to react. Only after Wen Shaoxiu and the others were already hundreds of metres away from them did they begin to flee.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Danger! Run!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, however, the overwhelming wave of attacks had arrived. In the face of the formidable sword intent radiating out from the broken sword, everyone felt as though they had fallen into an ice cellar, their blood frozen stiff and notions of dread assailed every part of their seas of wisdom.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A straightforward sword beam streaked forward and a cultivator was cleaved apart. The cultivator was a half-step Human Immortal clad in a Sacred-tier armour. Additionally, there were also layers of thick energy shields around him. And yet, in the face of the sword beam, all of his defences became even weaker than tofu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This is bad!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Argh!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>A small storm of sword beams swept forward, sucking a cultivator into itself. The cultivator only managed one wretched cry before he was reduced to ash.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heartless Heaven's Dire Bloodflare Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Grand Bloodslip Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Secret Primeburn Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Soulburn!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Bodyburst of the Divine Demon!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>One by one, the remaining cultivators shouted as they utilized their life-saving techniques to push themselves beyond their limits, allowing them to move several times faster as they charged forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Space itself began shaking as streams of light flashed. Facing the threat of death, the cultivators put their lives on the line to display their evasion techniques.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite that, two more cultivators were killed by the sword beams, reduced to ash in the end. As for those who managed to escape with their lives, all of them were wounded. Some were so grievously wounded that they were practically on the verge of dying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Compared to them, however, Chen Feng was the slowest, trailing behind them all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing them give it their all to flee, Chen Feng chuckled. Jerking his palm, the Death Sword appeared in his grip and he turned around. Next, he swung.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Slicing Sword Beam! Cut!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword light flashed and a sword beam that was slashing towards Chen Feng was cut into pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even so, the monumental momentum behind the sword beam felt like a lightning strike to Chen Feng. His figure became like a meteor, blasting backwards at an even greater velocity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s actions seemingly triggered an even bigger change. The sword beams that were originally flying in different directions suddenly turned to attack Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Spiralling Sword Beam.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword Beam of the Mighty Yang.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword Beam of Winds and Clouds.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword Beam of the Fiery Volcano.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sword Beam of Vastness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In addition to the five sword beams, there was also a storm of sword beams surging towards Chen Feng. Ignoring who would arrive first, all of them descended upon Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen!” Wen Shaoxiu cried out in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By then, Wen Shaoxiu and the others were already nearly 50 kilometres away from their earlier positions. Chen Feng was the only one left behind. Turning his head, Wen Shaoxiu saw that Chen Feng was fighting against the sword beams. Seeing what Chen Feng had to face, all of them felt a soul-shaking feeling of dread gripping them.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! The kid has a death wish! Who does he think he is? He thinks he can stop the attack of an Immortal artefact?” The cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect laughed, gloating at Chen Feng’s predicament.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>I ended up becoming their targets. As it so happens, I can use this to test how much stronger I have become.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s left hand made a grasping motion and the Life Sword appeared in his grip. Next, he brought the Twin Swords of Life and Death up in a criss-crossing fashion to unleash – with lightning-like speed – his most powerful sword move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Storm of Sword Beams!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This time, Chen Feng channelled all of his power to mobilize the Twin Swords of Life and Death. In fact, the streams of primary energy within his body were coursing so quickly that they ended up creating tears on some of his meridians.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>In Chen Feng’s opinion, this move from him had brought out at least half of the Twin Swords of Life and Death’s full power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Two sword beams, one black and one white, kept blending together as they expanded, becoming like a great river erupting outwards. It looked as though two storms were clashing against one another.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The various sword beams clashed. However, in the face of the other sword beams, the Storm of Sword Beams from Chen Feng could only endure for one blink’s worth of time before it was utterly broken.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, the sword beams inundated Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen!” Wen Shaoxiu’s face sank greatly. He wanted to charge towards Chen Feng, but Wang Xinglong stopped him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha, good! Serves him right!” one of the cultivators from Heartless Heaven Sect laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You’re asking for death!” Wen Shaoxiu grew infuriated and he rushed forward to fire out a sword beam of lightning and fire at the cultivator.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You think I am afraid of you?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>They quickly began fighting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Cough! Cough! Cough!” Suddenly, a human figure flew towards them. It was Chen Feng. Looking somewhat miserable, he appeared before them all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Upon his appearance, the Twin Swords of Life and Death in his hands unleashed yet another Storm of Sword Beams at the cultivators on Heartless Heaven Sect’s side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The move from Chen Feng instantly killed off two cultivators. It also grievously wounded another two.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Normally, Chen Feng would not have been able to so easily do that. However, all of them had been wounded by the broken sword’s sword beams earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Ha ha ha! Brother Chen, you are all right! Kill! Don’t let a single one of them escape!” Seeing Chen Feng, Wen Shaoxiu laughed out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What? How is this possible? How can you be all right? Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nothing is impossible,” Chen Feng said coolly, the sword in his hand swinging down. Black light flashed and a spiralling sword beam rushed forward. The formidable death energy contained within it could affect even the minds of others.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kill! Great Iron Sword Technique!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Mystic Astral Sword Beam!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Boltflame Sword Beam!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Wen Shaoxiu and the other two from Heavenly Sword Faction ignored their wounds and attacked. There was only one thought running through their minds, to join forces with Chen Feng to kill off all of the cultivators on Heartless Heaven Sect’s side.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Pu!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I cannot accept this!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Another person was killed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The rest of the cultivators there became terrified. One of them was quick to react and he crushed his Teleportation Talisman. A spatial passageway opened up and he was teleported out.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>All of the remaining cultivators on Heartless Heaven Sect’s side were slaughtered by Chen Feng and the others. Although another one managed to open up the spatial passageway, a sword beam from Chen Feng smashed him into pieces before he could escape.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“These fellows are so ruthless!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The few cultivators who were previously allied with Heavenly Sword Faction did not attack. They simply watched as Wen Shaoxiu’s group butchered those on Heartless Heaven Sect’s side as though they were simply chopping up vegetables. They then exchanged glances, looks of shock on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the other cultivators who were watching from afar, they grew so shocked, they did not know what to say. After some time, one of them finally said, “Heavenly Sword Faction is truly filled with madmen. Their attacks are so ruthless.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Nothing ruthless about it. This is a dog-eat-dog place to begin with. We should think instead about our current situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“We’re all wounded here. What, are they going to attack us despite their wounds?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“It’s not impossible.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are you fellows not going to scram?” As expected, Wen Shaoxiu’s gaze swept over towards them, killing energy surging out from him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wen Shaoxiu, don’t go overboard! We did not attack you fellows earlier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Spare me the bullshit! I will count to three. If you guys still won’t leave, we’ll kill you!” Wen Shaoxiu said with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Don’t think we’re afraid of you! If it comes down to it, we’ll just fight you fellows to the death!” One of them remained defiant.</span></p>
