 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was still in the midst of a ferocious battle against the youngster in black armour. Rather, the battle was growing in intensity. Speaking of which, Chen Feng was constantly in a disadvantageous spot. Despite having set up the Eight Trigrams Sword Array, he was still incapable of turning the table on the youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The power that the youngster displayed with his spear was simply too strong. Every thrust of the spear would require every trick Chen Feng knew of to handle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Puchi! Puchi! Puchi!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Three sounds rang out repeatedly and blood flowed out from Chen Feng’s chest. Three round, bloody holes in the ‘</span><span>品</span><span>’ shape had appeared on his chest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Despite the protection of the Sacred-tier body armour, the sharp and formidable streams of energy were still able to enter Chen Feng’s body. Due to that, Chen Feng felt his heart beating violently. It felt as though it would explode at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, how are you so stupid?” Tower’s dissatisfied voice reached him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am already giving it my all here!” Chen Feng revealed a bitter smile. He focused on steadying his wounds while mobilizing the sword array to fight the youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Human, you are too weak. Although there is a great power within you, it is not yours. In my case, I can use a portion of my strength to unleash an attack that is twice as strong. You, on the other hand, cannot even unleash an attack that is as strong as one third of the power within you. This is all because your level is too low. You are simply no match for me.” A ridiculing look could be seen on the youngster’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng said nothing. His fingers kept moving around. The tips of his fingers burst open and droplets of blood flew out to fall upon the sword array, causing the power of the sword array to rise by a notch.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng had displayed the Bloody Nether Guide Art, extracting the blood essence within his body for this move. By utilizing this secret technique, he could increase his power. However, he would end up in a weakened state after this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Useless! Even if you are twice as strong, it will still be useless.” The youngster sneered as he stabbed continuously with his spear. Every thrust of his spear would leave flower-like sparks upon the sword array, causing it to tremble. It seemed as though the sword array would break apart at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Sigh, I am still not strong enough. Looks like I won’t be able to hold on anymore</span></em><span>. Chen Feng felt depressed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Will all our efforts end up in vain this time? This is a Dao artefact! Not to mention, it has eight Demon Kings under it!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>NO! I have been relying too much on the Longevity Tower all this time. No matter what, I cannot fail this time!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng finally made up his mind. He would utilize the secret technique again to extract even more of his blood essence.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, have you gone crazy? Forget it! Since we cannot refine this Dao artefact, we’ll leave this place first. We’ll return once we are fully prepared.” Realizing what Chen Feng was planning to do, Tower grew shocked and he quickly attempted to stop him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as Chen Feng was about to go all out, something suddenly happened to the youngster. The sky-encompassing spear silhouettes he unleashed suddenly disappeared and the youngster himself froze, becoming like an immobile, 10,000-year-old rock.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What happened?” The sudden turn of events surprised Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Kacha! Kacha! Kacha!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was as though the youngster had truly transformed into a stone sculpture. Next, cracking sounds could be heard as cracks began spreading across the surface of the youngster’s body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How unexpected. After all this time, I am still fated to collapse.” The expression on the youngster’s face flickered for a moment before finally regaining its composure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Kid, this is a good chance. This artefact spirit was wounded before. His time is finally up!” There was excitement in Tower’s voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“So fortuitous?” Chen Feng was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, as the number of cracks on the youngster’s body continued to rise, the 1,000-zhang-tall Demon Subduing Mountain outside gradually became unsteady. The Demon Kings roared again and again, but they were incapable of stopping the Demon Subduing Mountain from weakening.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Tower was quick to take advantage of the situation. The Longevity Tower rushed forward and began devouring the Demon Subduing Mountain’s power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If I don’t grasp such a good opportunity, Heaven will despise me!” Chen Feng strode forward to unleash a furious palm blow against the youngster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The youngster did not dodge and a banging sound rang out as the youngster’s body exploded. There was no explosion of flesh and blood. Rather, his body transformed into countless streams of essence power.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Heavengulping Absorption Technique!” Chen Feng’s hands abruptly grasped forward and the streams of essence power were all pulled over before flowing into his body.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng was simply storing the streams of energy within his body. There was no way for him to refine so much power. By refining all that power, Chen Feng’s level of strength would likely rise to a terrifying level. That was the power of a Dao artefact’s artefact spirit. It was something that not even a Sacred-tier medicinal pill could hope to compare against. Truth be told, the artefact spirit was even more valuable than the Dao artefact.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Refining the artefact spirit was the equivalent of refining the Dao artefact. The thought of him accomplishing that astounded even Chen Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Naturally, as someone who practiced the Heavengulping Absorption Technique, Chen Feng believed that he could devour the artefact spirit’s power. It was simply a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Finally, Chen Feng finished absorbing the dispersed artefact spirit’s power. Although the refining process was still incomplete, controlling the Demon Subduing Mountain was no longer a difficult matter for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It did not take long for Chen Feng to take control of the core of the magic treasure. Next, he sensed eight soul imprints becoming connected to his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>It’s the eight Demon Kings!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng grew elated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng exerted control over the Demon Subduing Mountain, causing it to stop and shrink down. By the time Chen Feng reappeared outside, the 1,000-zhang-tall Demon Subduing Mountain had shrunk to become only one-chi-tall. It rested quietly on Chen Feng’s palm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the eight Demon Kings, all of them had returned to the Demon Subduing Mountain, even the three that were suppressed inside the Longevity Tower earlier. However, all of them had become submissive. Although there were looks of unwillingness within their eyes, there was nothing they could do about it. As Chen Feng was now in control of the Demon Subduing Mountain, he was also in control of the Demon Kings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The place regained an atmosphere of tranquillity and the Longevity Tower returned into Chen Feng’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The harvest this time is great! A top-grade Dao artefact and eight Demon Kings. Tower, the Dao artefact is yours. However, I want the eight Demon Kings as helpers,” Chen Feng said smilingly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No problem.” Tower nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>For Chen Feng, losing the Dao artefact was not a loss. Having the Longevity Tower was enough. For other cultivators, this Demon Subduing Mountain might be a peerless magic treasure. However, for Chen Feng, it was simply material for increasing the Longevity Tower’s strength.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This was a truly dangerous situation. We nearly failed during the final lap. Thankfully, the Demon Subduing Mountain’s artefact spirit was already on his last legs. If it weren’t for that, it would have been really difficult. Sigh, I lost some of my blood essence this time around. It will take quite some time to recover them.” Chen Feng shook his head before grasping with a hand. Next, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard was brought over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Luck wise, this Demonic One-eyed Lizard was in the same category as the human cultivators who appeared as the Longevity Tower was battling the Demon Subduing Mountain. No matter how you cut it, it was a very powerful Demon King. However, it was far inferior compared to the eight Demon Kings. It was simply a low-level Demon King while the eight Demon Kings were high-level Demon Kings. Not to mention, they had a numerical advantage.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>By the time it was captured by the Four-eyed Spirit Fox, the Demonic One-eyed Lizard was already badly injured. Later, the Demon Subduing Mountain and the Longevity Tower began fighting each other, smashing into one another again and again. Sadly for the Demonic One-eyed Lizard, in the face of the resulting shockwaves, the only option it had was to go die.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>It was quaked to death. Just before dying, it thought to itself. <em>If only I’d known it would end this way, I would never, never run here! Even fighting to the death against the human would be much better than to die in such a pointless manner!!!</em></span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng stretched his hand to pluck out a wheel-sized eyeball. It was the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s eyeball, something that it had spent tens of thousands of years cultivating. It looked like a large gem, shining with light. All else aside, its appearance alone was extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After falling into Chen Feng’s grasp, the eyeball began radiating circular waves of red light before transforming into a fist-sized crystal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This thing contains all of the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s eye power. After refining and absorbing it all, my eye technique will level up at least once!” Chen Feng exclaimed in delight.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Weng!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, Chen Feng’s right eye promptly spun, transforming into a rapidly spinning vortex. Strands of dark light spread out from the vortex to envelop the eyeball before sucking it into the vortex.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After absorbing the eyeball, Chen Feng waved his hand to keep the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s corpse. That was a Demon King’s corpse, after all. Its fleshly body was far more valuable compared to that of Human Immortals. It was better for pill concoction, artefact forging or selling.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next up, Chen Feng did not leave. Instead, he entered the Longevity Tower, where he began healing himself. He had exhausted some of his blood essence in this battle, causing his strength to decrease somewhat. Thus, some recuperation was required.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for Tower, he simply pulled out the Demon Subduing Mountain before happily gulping it down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Sigh! It is true that nothing remains the same in this world. In the past, I wouldn’t even deign to pay attention to a piece of trash like this. Unexpectedly, I would need it to restore my strength.” Tower lamented as he devoured the Demon Subduing Mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As for the eight Demon Kings, they stayed inside the Longevity Tower in a submissive manner. In the beginning, they had revealed a somewhat arrogant behaviour, believing that Chen Feng could only control them through the Demon Subduing Mountain. However, upon sensing the Longevity Tower’s aura, they all turned docile, becoming like obliging pet dogs lying on the floor, waiting for the Longevity Tower’s commands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Divine Phantom Mink was also badly wounded in the battle. Thus, he stayed quietly inside the Longevity Tower while focusing on his recovery. He ignored the eight Demon Kings.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Only after swallowing and refining a total of 10 Blood Pills was Chen Feng able to recover the lost blood essence. After making a full recovery, Chen Feng began refining the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s eyeball.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Speaking of which, the power of the Demon Subduing Mountain’s artefact spirit was still stored inside Chen Feng’s body. That was the artefact spirit of a top-grade Dao artefact. However, Chen Feng had chosen to refine the eyeball first because the quality of the artefact spirit’s power was simply too high. Given his present level of strength, he would likely be incapable of attaining his desired result even after spending a long time on it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng’s left eye was silent and all his energy was focused on his right eye. The eye power generated by the Magic Eyes of Darkness grinded the Demonic One-eyed Lizard’s eyeball. After 100 grinding processes, a strand of energy fell off the surface of the eyeball and was quickly absorbed into the pupil. After just a few rotations, the strand of energy was utterly refined, transformed to become part of Chen Feng’s power.</span></p>
