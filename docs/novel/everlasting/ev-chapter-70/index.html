<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Light suddenly flashed out before Chen Feng and his feet landed upon soft ground. Next, a rich fragrance of flowers entered his nose.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What is this place?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Looking around, Chen Feng saw that they were standing amidst a sea of flowers with soft green grasses growing on the ground. Raising his head, he saw that the clear sky was a deep blue colour while the clouds rolled about thousands of li away (1 li = 0.5 km).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“A good scenery.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Even Lu Ta, who would usually show an indifferent attitude, was unable to stop himself from praising the place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Judging by the level of my magic power, we should be over 1,000 li away from the place,” said Ye Ziming after a moment’s pondering.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“One thousand li away. In other words, we have yet to even make our way out from Black Origin Mountain Range?” asked Chen Feng curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“No, Black Origin Mountain Range is very big. It is not possible to get out of here with just one spatial array, unless I am at the Sky Human stage. Either that, or if I possess a highly powerful spatial-type magic treasure,” said Ye Ziming.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Although we are not out of this place, we did at least make it out from that dangerous situation.” After saying that, Chen Feng sat down and began to heal his injuries.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“You two, protect me,” said Chen Feng as he looked at both Ye Ziming and Lu Ta.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Why should we? The two of us have suffered from injuries as well,” replied Lu Ta candidly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I told you earlier, I have only sucked the Great Yao inside. I have not restrained it. If it escapes, the three of us will be in hot soup,” said Chen Feng calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen’s words are reasonable. The two of us will protect you,” said Ye Ziming with a smile. After that, he moved to the side and stood still. He was actually going to stand guard for Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Ye Ziming’s actions, Lu Ta went silent. He too, moved to the side and the two of them stood guard on the left and right of Chen Feng. Should anything happen, the two of them would step forward to handle it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Huh, you can’t blame me for being too cautious. After all, we have only known each other for a short period of time. There is no telling what is going on within the minds of others. I cannot trust others so easily</span></em><span>. A guilty Chen Feng thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Next, with a thought, Chen Feng’s figure disappeared, leaving only a dark-yellow little tower on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Seeing Chen Feng disappear, both Ye Ziming and Lu Ta were taken aback. That was especially true for Lu Ta. After seeing the Longevity Tower, though, a glint of greed flashed through his eyes and he moved towards the tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Ye Ziming spoke up, stopping Lu Ta.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Brother Chen should be in the process of restraining the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm. We should protect him properly,” said Ye Ziming coolly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Lu Ta’s face froze. Then, without saying a word, he turned and returned to his post.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After Chen Feng entered the Longevity Tower, he saw the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm roaring as it bombarded the wall of the Longevity Tower. Furthermore, thanks to the mess wrought by the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm, even the Four-eared Spirit Monkey had managed to extricate itself from its shackles. One yao beast and one Great Yao roared ceaselessly within the Longevity Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Earlier, Chen Feng had only sent out a portion of his divine sense. Thus, he could not unleash the Longevity Tower’s strongest level of power. Naturally, restraining the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm was out of the question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After entering the Longevity Tower, the first thing Chen Feng did was to restrain the Four-eared Spirit Monkey once more. The Four-eared Spirit Monkey had been locked up within the Longevity Tower all this time, leading to a decline of its might and aura. Thus, it was easily restrained by Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, facing the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm, Chen Feng knew that it would not be easy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Longevity Tower restraints, bind!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>After restraining the Four-eared Spirit Monkey, Chen Feng sent out a grasping motion towards the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm. The surrounding streams of energy gathered together to wrap around the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>However, with just a minor flick of its body, the Great Yao managed to break apart the shackles wrapping around it. After that, crackling sounds could be heard as an electric current flowed through the horn on its head. Next, a purple-coloured thunderbolt shot out towards Chen Feng, arriving before him in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Shua!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Just as the purple-coloured thunderbolt was about to strike Chen Feng, he disappeared only to re-appear over a hundred metres away. During that critical moment, Chen Feng had utilized the Longevity Tower’s restraining functions to shift himself away. If that attack had struck home, he would most certainly be torn apart. If that were to happen, Chen Feng would receive the honour of being a cultivator who had died within his own magic treasure.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How dangerous! Have a taste of my Longevity Chains!” Chen Feng shouted aloud as his hands continued forming hand seals. Next, the Longevity Tower gave a shudder. Then, every energy stream within the first level of the Longevity Tower rose before swiftly condensing into thick chains. The chains were grey in colour and they shone with a light of tangibility. It was as though they were made from iron.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>This technique that Chen Feng had just displayed was one of the secret techniques from the Longevity Scripture. However, as Chen Feng’s cultivation base was lacking, he could not condense out the Longevity Chains in the outside world. He was presently borrowing the Longevity Tower’s power to unleash this move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As expected, after the Longevity Chains were condensed out, it displayed its prowess. The chains circled around every part of the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm’s body before tightening, wrapping up the Great Yao within its bound. It did not take long for the chains to tie the Great Yao up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Puny human. You think that you can lock me up with the power of a magic treasure? Feast your eyes on true power!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Rampaging Thunder Snake!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm’s silvery-white body suddenly shuddered with intensity. Finally, with one final shudder, wave after wave of silvery snakes condensed using the power of lightning slipped out. Every one of the silvery snakes was ten metres long. They looked like giant pythons. Additionally, four sharp talons grew out from its abdomen area. The instant they emerged, they bit and tore at the Longevity Chains non-stop. At the same time, three of the silvery snakes attacked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>What technique is this? Doppelgangers? No, this is probably similar to my condensation of the Longevity Chains. All those silvery snakes must be the condensed form of the magic powers within the Great Yao. Formidable! This Great Yao is not to be underestimated. The first move it made is a secret skill. Though, I wonder. Is this an innate skill, or is it something it cultivated?</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng considered without panicking. Instead, he kept forming hand seals and chain after chain shot out before Chen Feng’s body to tie up the silvery snakes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh! I would like to see what other skills you have,” said Chen Feng as he gasped for breath. He had already been injured earlier after all. At present, the restraining efforts was exhausting him further. He could feel the unbearable fatigue on both his flesh and spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Advent of the Purple Dragon!” Once again, the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm uttered out human words and his horn radiated with a dazzling purple light. Next, a purple-coloured wyrm flew out from the horn. Immediately, the aura of a powerful yao beast spread out into the surrounding area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Crash!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>The instant the purple-coloured wyrm appeared, it tore open the Longevity Chains. The Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm then broke its way out of the chains with a howl. Next, the two wyrms, one silver and one purple, charged simultaneously at Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Gha ha ha ha ha! Kid, you didn’t expect this, did you? I have already formed a clone. Did you think these little tricks could restrain me? You don’t know the meaning of the word death!” shouted the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Crap! This is really bad! I should quickly get out!</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng cried bitterly to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>As Chen Feng was about to leave, two streams of light descended from the sky to instantly press down on the two wyrms.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>Chen Feng felt as though the entire Longevity Tower was quaking. The purple-coloured wyrm transformed into a purple-coloured energy stream, before flowing back into the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm’s body. As for the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm, it lay on the ground, incapable of moving at all. A one-zhang tall stone stele had appeared atop its body, suppressing it. The stone stele had been condensed from the stream of light from before. Light flowed across the surface of the stone stele, which was inscribed with countless runes. While it could not even compare to the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm in terms of size, the stone stele was like a 10,000-zhang tall mountain as it suppressed the Purplebolt Silverlight Wyrm to the point where it could not even mount a struggle (1 zhang = 3.333 m).</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The mysterious fellow has taken action,” said a shocked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Huh, I finally recovered a little bit of my power.” The mysterious voice rang out once more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Are your injuries healed up? Can you reveal yourself?” asked Chen Feng loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I’m still far from it. I have told you before last time, I am the Longevity Tower. We practically see each other every day,” the mysterious voice answered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Then, how should I address you in the future?” asked Chen Feng.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Tower, just call me Tower,” said the mysterious voice calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><em><span>Tower, what a strange name.</span></em><span>&nbsp;Chen Feng thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“What a pity! The amount of Water of Life absorbed is too miniscule. Not to mention, it is the extrinsically formed type. It’s not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth. I can barely suppress this little yao here. Things like subduing and breaking down, forget it,” said Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How much Water of Life is needed for you to fully recover?” Chen Feng suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“How much Water of Life? Ha ha ha, no matter how much there is, it will be insufficient to fully restore me. It can only strengthen me slightly,” said Tower with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“If so, what would it take for you to fully recover?” Chen Feng had more or less figured out Tower’s identity.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Fully recover, that is somewhat difficult. Even after cultivating to the immortal stage, it may still be impossible for you to let me recover fully. In order for me to recover back to my complete state, I will require a great deal of divine objects from the myriad celestial planes,” replied Tower after a moment of consideration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Divine objects from the myriad celestial planes? What is that?” Chen Feng’s brows furrowed together as he got the feeling that this matter was not as simple as he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“For example, Chaos energy, Enigma Source energy, Longevity energy. Those are the highest ranking amongst the essence powers within the Celestial planes. Immeasurable Eversand, Nine Divinity Jade, Purpleglory Copper essence, Five-coloured Divine Iron. Those are rare metals and ores. There are also Solar Prime Water, Lunar Prime Water, Lunar Immortal Flame, Nether Abyss Flame. Those are the various waters and flames. And, Mystorigin Jadeblood Crystal, Divine Blood Soil…” Tower uttered out hundreds of materials in a single go. If it weren’t for Chen Feng interrupting him, who knows how long he would continue?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Stop, stop, stop!” Chen Feng called out hastily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Those are just a part of the materials. There are many more that I myself cannot remember. In short, if I want to fully recover, I will need a great deal of Heavenly treasures, rare ores, immortal steel and divine iron. Additionally, they all need to be of high-grade.” Tower continued to take an indifferent tone. It would appear he was not joking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Where can those materials you mentioned be found?” Chen Feng asked a more practical question.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“This world should have some of the materials I mentioned. However, most of them will be in the Immortal Plane,” Tower said slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Immortal Plane… … I… … you… …” Chen Feng did not know whether to laugh or cry. He felt as though Tower was messing around with him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“I am not messing with you in the slightest. All I said is true,” said Tower in a solemn tone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“Even if they are true, where should I go to find those items? I am just a puny Concealed stage cultivator. Who knows? I might end up getting killed tomorrow. Is there a need to even consider something as illusionary as the Immortal Plane?” Chen Feng could not hold himself back and he shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0"><span>“The Immortal Plane is not some illusionary object. It is something that truly exists. Once your cultivation base has reached a certain level, you will naturally come to understand that,” Tower slowly replied. Hearing his reply, Chen Feng was once again uncertain whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
