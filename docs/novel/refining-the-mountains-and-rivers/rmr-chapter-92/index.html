 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping restrained his aura. He asked, “And, may I ask where my good-for-nothing disciple is right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu reached backwards. A pitch black form fell out from the valley. “His injuries are heavy, but he hasn’t died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With no dead person, things would be much easier to discuss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping bent down and probed his disciple. As he did, his complexion sank. He picked the man up and walked to the side. Today, he wouldn’t be involved in deciding how things ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tall and strong fellow stepped forwards. His ash black face was calm. “You can call me War Bear. I greet fellow daoist.” His voice was as grating as iron on iron, and from the pressure his voice emitted…this person’s cultivation…was extremely high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu’s look didn’t change. “I am Qin Yu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear cupped his hands together. “May I ask fellow daoist Qin why you interfered in today’s matters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu lightly said, “I am old acquaintances with this young miss.” The hidden meaning behind his words was that he was unrelated to Wang Zifeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear’s eyes flashed. “Then fellow daoist, do you refute that junior’s words?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu coldly sneered, “It is a bunch of nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear hesitated for several breaths of time. He nodded, “I believe fellow daoist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several people furrowed their eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear continued to say, “With fellow daoist Qin’s cultivation, he should be able to fully view the contents of the jade slip. If he knew what was inside, why would he stay here and wait for us to arrive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This explanation was very vague. Gu Shengping and another man and woman looked thoughtful for a moment. Slowly, they also nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng felt his limbs turn cold, as if he had fallen into an icy lake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could things turn out like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t how things were supposed to go. They were supposed to work together and break through the formation before suppressing and killing Qin Yu. Then, they would seize his treasures, and because of disputes over how to divide those treasures, they would fight again, giving him time to escape! But, all of you would just believe a few words from that boy? Based on what, you bastards!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng stiffened, his neck becoming straight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear’s eyes gleamed with killing intent. “You dare to deceive us? Junior, you are quite bold!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng wailed, “Senior, I didn’t deceive you!” His face was full of pleading. “Junior-apprentice Sister Xueqing, please testify for me, tell them what happened!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Xueqing bit her lips. She shook her head and said, “Fellow daoist Qin never took the jade slip.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng’s eyes flew open. “You bitch you have killed me! You have killed me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear lifted his hand and brought it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the sound of breaking air filled the skies, accompanied with a deep and angry roar. “Who dares injure the disciple I sent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng was like a suffocating fish that was tossed back into the water. His ash white face suddenly lit up once more. He shouted out loudly, “Uncle Qiu, I’m right here! Hurry and save me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu He fell to the ground, the imposing aura in his eyes rapidly rising. The aura of a ninth level Golden Core was as heavy as a mountain, and even the air seemed to thicken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes swept around until they fell on War Bear. “With your cultivation you actually attacked a junior. You have gone too far!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the aura of a ninth level Golden Core, these spoken words carried a great weight. The scene immediately fell quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng bitterly glared at Yun Xueqing. He thought to himself, you cheating bitch, you thought to betray me and place me in a deathtrap, now I’ll see just how much you beg me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that his Uncle Qiu had arrived, his cultivation would be able to suppress the entire situation. These demonic path cultivators wouldn’t be able to be wildly arrogant anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear frowned. He drew back one step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu He calmed down. These several people in front of him had considerably strong auras, and he didn’t want to provoke them. And now, judging from their actions, they also seemed to fear him a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also good. No one here had bitter enmities against each other, so it would be good if they could openly discuss the issue and come to an amicable agreement. Why did they have to fight and kill all the time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a light cough, Qiu He was just about to say several polite words to set the tone, and then continue onto the matter at hand. But before he could speak, the situation suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground beneath War Bear disintegrated. The reason he took one step back was actually to gather strength. At this moment when he attacked, his strength was like a raging river that broke through a dam, as violent and deadly as a dreadful flash flood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one punch, the potential of a thousand soldiers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu He roared with surprised anger. He thrust out his palm, magic power tumbling around him. But, he had underestimated the strength contained in that fist. With a dull crack like striking thunder, the cloth covering his arm burst apart, revealing red lines covering the surface of his skin. These were actually tiny blood vessels that had broken apart from the potent vibrating strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground beneath his feet collapsed. Qiu He was forced back again and again, each step he took causing crushed stones to fill the air, mixed with a terrifying strength that caused explosions to sound out all over. Although he was shocked by how strong his opponent was, as long as he had enough time he could mobilize enough magic power to stabilize himself and then return the favor with a deadly counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But behind War Bear, Gu Shengping raised his hand in the air and instantly drew a talisman. He waved it, sending it landing on Qiu He’s body. This talisman symbol didn’t have any killing strength, but it actually possessed a sealing ability, and an even stronger ability to muddle the magic power within a cultivator and impede the revolution of their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu He’s magic power was originally impeded, and after he was attacked by the talisman, it completely froze for a moment. He stiffened, revealing a fatal opening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The daoist with a thin and long face and small beady eyes suddenly moved forwards. Black light flowed out from the ground and then drilled into Qiu He’s body as if it were a living creature. Qiu He’s eyes instantly darkened and his face filled with pain. Finally, the female cultivator flicked her sleeve and a red ribbon lashed out like a bolt of electricity and returned just as fast. The only difference was that as it returned, it seemed just a little bit more red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puff –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood burst out from a split neck. A skull split open, causing a flower of blood to bloom in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ninth level Golden Core Qiu He had died!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And at this time, War Bear rushed forth before coming to a violent stop. Cruel slaughter energy rose up all around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around, locking his eyes onto Qin Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. Although his expression was dignified, he didn’t have the least bit of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time seemed to come to a halt for several breaths. War Bear finally let out a deep breath of air. As if it were a signal, the heart-shaking oppressive aura in the air began to quietly scatter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He cupped his hands across his chest and smiled. “Things happened so suddenly. I hope that fellow daoist Qin doesn’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu remained indifferent. “Everyone, is this a warning to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping sneered. “And what if it is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere that had been calming down suddenly became tense again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu’s eyes turned cold. “Then, you can all feel free to try!” Although his aura didn’t change, a trace of slaughter energy surged out from him. It was thin yet deep, and left the people in the back feeling cold. For such a killing intent to make them feel such dread, it had to come from killing cultivators of the same level, and definitely more than one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear hurriedly said. “This is just a misunderstanding. Fellow daoist Qin, don’t think too much about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping’s face turned as dark as water. He coldly snorted and fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Puff –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiu He’s corpse fell to the ground. The rank smell of blood curled in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zifeng seemed as if he had restored himself a little, but now he fell onto his butt, in a trance like he had lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he slowly came to the realization that everyone was looking at him. He regained his senses and began to shiver. He cried out, “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear frowned. He raised his hand and slapped out. Wang Zifeng’s head exploded and he accompanied Qiu He to the yellow springs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping licked his lips. “There’s one more remaining, and she’s a very beautiful young woman too. Killing her would be a waste. How about passing her to me so I can enjoy her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Xueqing paled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu lightly said, “She is my friend. You cannot touch her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping’s cheeks twitched. A yin chill crept into his eyes. “Qin Yu, don’t reach for a yard after taking an inch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu’s expression didn’t change. “Anyone who touches her, I will kill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man with the thin and long face, Daoist Wuyuan, smiled. “Fellow daoists, please calm down a little. That girl is just a little baby; killing her or leaving her alive isn’t important at all. Let’s look at the jade slip first and see if the contents are complete.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear nodded. “Alright!” He flipped through Wang Zifeng’s headless corpse and found a jade slip. After probing it, he smiled, “The seal is still intact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Wuyuan turned around. “The seal is there and those two juniors clearly didn’t know the contents of it. If so, then how about fellow daoist Gu shows some mercy and lets go of this little baby girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping flicked his sleeves and turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear said, “Fellow daoist Qin, while we won’t kill this baby girl, you need to guarantee that she won’t tell anyone of today’s events.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu said, “When you killed people, I didn’t intervene.” The meaning behind these words was that if this story were to get out, it wouldn’t be advantageous to him either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused for a moment and then turned around. “Miss Yun, I wonder if you would like to remain a guest in my valley for some time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Xueqing had a grateful expression. She hurriedly said, “I would. For the next month, I won’t take even half a step out of the valley.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear and Daoist Wuyuan paused for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a month, the matter should already be settled. Even if this little girl told everyone that they killed Qiu He and Wang Zifeng, so what?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these past years, they hadn’t killed enough people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the group of four, the only female cultivator suddenly said in a soft voice, “Fellow daoist War Bear, for the following matter, do you think there is a part for fellow daoist Qin Yu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear smiled. “Fairy maiden’s thoughts are my own. But, concerning this, the four of us must come to a unanimous agreement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Wuyuan’s eyes flashed. “I have no opinion.” He looked at Gu Shengping. “Brother Gu, the greater picture is what matters. There is no need to haggle over minor things like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping had a gloomy expression. He grunted and didn’t speak; this could be considered agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear cupped his hands across his chest. “Fellow daoist Qin, we have discovered a treasure land, and were wondering whether or not you would like to join us? Of course, we cannot guarantee any harvests and the dangers are definitely there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu eyed the jade slip. He hesitated and shook his head, “I’m reluctant to do anything right now, so I won’t be joining in on competing for any profits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear didn’t hide his disappointment. Without talking too much, he bid his farewells and the several people departed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After watching the group travel far away, Qin Yu’s tense heart began to relax a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four people were all at the late Golden Core realm, and the strength they could erupt with was even greater. With Qin Yu’s current strength, he didn’t have any guarantee he could defeat them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, withdrawing wasn’t difficult at all. With the Blood Escape Art, War Bear and the others would only be able to watch helplessly as he flew away. This was the only reason he had such a strong performance just now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wouldn’t be an idiot like Qiu He. A noble ninth level Golden Core, a rarity even within the entire Southern Empire and Northern Dynasty, had died miserably because he had tried to pull rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu tamped down these thoughts. He turned and said, “Miss Yun, for security reasons, please.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yun Xueqing closed her eyes, her long eyelashes shivering. “I’ll have to trouble fellow daoist Qin Yu to guide me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young miss, her thoughts were actually quite exquisite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled. He flicked his sleeves and grabbed hold of her, stepping into the fog together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping’s complexion was ugly. He looked around, “Every one of you is a powerful individual, so why were you all so cautious against that Qin Yu today? This is just too shameful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Wuyuan chuckled. He said, “Fellow daoist Gu, if you already know, why ask? This Qin Yu…hehe, he isn’t easy to deal with at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female cultivator floated forwards. “That fellow daoist Qin should have killed at least ten masters at the Golden Core realm, otherwise it would have been impossible for him to condense such thick slaughter energy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping clenched his teeth. “So what? If we all joined forces, are you saying we still wouldn’t have been able to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear said, “Although we never fought, I am positive that Qin Yu is far more difficult to deal with than that surname Qiu cultivator. If we all joined forces we might have been able to kill Qin Yu, but it was likely that we would have suffered severe wounds, or that some among us would have died. Right now we have much more important matters to attend to. I hope that fellow daoist Gu doesn’t interfere with the mission and create side issues.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough. Let us consider this matter settled for now. Fellow daoist Gu, what have your calculations told you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping took a deep breath. He said, “Although I haven’t locked onto the entrance yet, I have determined the general scope of where it is, within around 10 miles. Give me three more days and I should be able to find out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">War Bear nodded. “Then I’ll have to bother you with that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Shengping smugly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daoist Wuyuan smirked, a trace of disdain in his eyes. This Gu Shengping was infatuated with women and lacked any and all tact. He had no idea how this idiot had survived until today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group accelerated forwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one discovered that when Gu Shengping looked back, a strange light flickered in his eyes.</span></p>
