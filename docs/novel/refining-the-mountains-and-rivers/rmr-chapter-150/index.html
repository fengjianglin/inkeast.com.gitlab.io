 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the inedible Qin Yu was refining the 3000 year old sea blue bellvine flower that Old Sea had gifted to him. The medicinal efficacy was truly incredible! Perhaps he had misjudged its value earlier. If he really wanted to trade it, even 2 million spirit stones might not be enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last bit of blue color vanished from the bellvine flower. The petals wilted and withered until it eventually disintegrated into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu put the dust away. Before he left the capital city, he couldn’t leave behind any suspicious hints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance, this dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He silently calculated the time; night would arrive soon. Qin Yu contemplated the situation and took out the seven-leaf herb. He was deciding whether or not to allow it to continue bathing beneath the sea blue light for another night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to sea spirits, the little blue lamp had an unimaginably powerful ability to enhance them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something Qin Yu knew of before he even entered Sea Spirit Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the little blue lamp’s effect of accelerating the growth of spirit plants was considered one, then its ability to strengthen sea spirits was at least 10.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, this was a completely unreasonable ability!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about it over and over, Qin Yu decided to let the seven-leaf herb stay in the storage bag for another night. After all, that cold and overly arrogant Jing Guanjin was still Grandmaster Wu Zetian’s disciple, so it was best to be a bit more careful. Qin Yu could imagine a situation where he was full of confidence but was instead utterly humiliated in the end, and he didn’t hope for this to occur to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned his hand and took out a soul-strengthening treasure that Chief Manager Wu had purchased from another great city in the sea region. Qin Yu closed his eyes and started to refine it. Another night was almost enough time to improve his soul force further; he couldn’t let this time go to waste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what he didn’t know was just how this decision he made would force our cold and overly arrogant friend Jing Guanjin into a dead end, and what sort of tragic fate he would eventually suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A completely self-confident man who mocked his opponent for biting off more than he could chew, but in reality the man who was being mocked was actually closing his eyes and diligently refining treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anyone saw this scene, they definitely wouldn’t be able to help but laugh because this situation was truly ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the following story was awfully sad –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night arrived. The time-sensing coral followed its instincts that had developed over hundreds of millions of years. An enzyme started a reaction within, creating a transformation. Soon, the last traces of red turned into blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, within the storage ring, a foot of sea blue light quietly bloomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in a hall within the royal palace where the ten great Purple Cards were, the sensing treasure connected to Qin Yu’s sea spirit began to wildly hum as if it were caught in a storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, such an intense and consistent infusion of energy could only be described as caught in a storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clever Grandmaster Wu Zetian had already learnt his lesson and he maintained a calm demeanor without any reckless boasting or taunting at all. Even so, as he listened to the loud buzzing sound, he still felt fear and apprehension rise within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Damn it all! Just who was this Ning fellow that he was so hard to deal with!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes widened. He stubbornly glared at the sensing treasure as its light became increasingly bright and rich, and the speed…the speed also seemed faster than yesterday’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This simply defied all common sense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to enhancing a sea spirit’s energy, as it grew stronger it became increasingly difficult. But what Grandmaster Wu Zetian didn’t know was that the seven-leaf herb had already adapted to the little blue lamp’s strength yesterday, so it was able to absorb even more energy today and advance even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the humming of the sensing treasure came to a stop. Then, in front of shocked eyes, the light quietly gathered in on itself, turning into a light purple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had broken through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any preparations and without needing to gather energy for an all-out attempt, the haphazard infusion of energy had pushed the sea spirit to a higher level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This style left the Purple Cards sucking in a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This junior was vicious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian seemed to choke on himself. He violently coughed and hacked, his loud coughs and shaking covering his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the sleeve of his robes, he rapidly tapped the spirit shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin sat cross-legged on the floor. Even after resting for a long time, his face was still deathly pale. In the end, what he had been given wasn’t his own. In order to activate the Skyspirit energy, he had to consume a massive amount of his own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, his eyes flashed open. He pulled out a spirit shell and listened to the fast tapping sounds it produced. His face filled with shocked anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His first thought was – this is impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had galvanized the Skyspirit energy to force the sea spirit to advance to another level of quality in two days. Just what did that Ning fellow have that could accomplish this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, the loud and increasingly rapid tapping sounds clearly reminded him that this was reality. Wu Zetian would never play around with him like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He ruthlessly struck the spirit shell. Far away in the royal palace, Grandmaster Wu Zetian seemed to feel his disciple’s anger, so he stopped tapping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin took a deep breath and calmed his thoughts. He placed the spirit shell on a table nearby. After some time, his composure had been restored and his posture was tall and straight yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You want to fight with me? Surname Ning, you are far too presumptuous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vast and boundless monster energy raced through his body. The Skyspirit energy within his dantian was spurred on as it began to slowly flow through his meridians, passing through his fingertips and into the sea spirit. He could clearly sense that as the Skyspirit energy entered it, the sea spirit cheered in joy and grew increasingly strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With each breath of time, it grew stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, Jing Guanjin felt dizziness cloud his mind. He lifted a hand and tapped the spirit shell four times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap tap tap –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a question – what was the situation like now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, there was a response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant…that it wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin narrowed his eyes and sucked in a deep breath. He clenched his teeth and forcibly dispelled his dizziness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surname Ning, you are indeed hard to cope with. But even if you have a hundred methods in your hands, you will still lose today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Skyspirit power, continue pouring in for me – never stop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Monstrous energy galloped through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another 2 hours passed –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap tap tap –</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It still wasn’t good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixth hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin was paper-white and his eyes had turned a faint red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eighth hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin wobbled. He grabbed the work table with both hands, desperately holding on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no choice but to bet everything he had. He knew that his father had numerous children and the only reason he held any regard for him was because of today’s events. If he could smoothly accomplish his mission then he would undoubtedly reap all the attention and affection of his father. He would be destined to climb to the summit of the highest clouds in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if he were defeated…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The preparations had been made for a long time and an incredible price had been paid. Even the precious Skyspirit power had been granted to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin didn’t dare to imagine the consequences of failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So, he could only go all-out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin’s shivering fingers tapped the spirit shell. His hair was a mess and his eyes were bloodshot. His elegant robes were matted with sweat and he leaned against the work table, barely managing to stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian soon responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap tap tap –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hurry up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap tap tap tap tap tap –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This boy is stronger than you!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin spat out a mouthful of blood. He toppled onto the worktable and his forehead smashed into the spirit shell. He was already unconscious. Luckily, he didn’t feel the pain of his forehead being struck and left bleeding, and he slumped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the palace, the spirit shell in Grandmaster Wu Zetian’s hand nearly leapt up. He violently coughed once more to cover the sound, his heart shocked by the sudden response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at how much strength was placed in striking the spirit shell, Jing Guanjin’s situation should be good. Although he might have temporarily fallen behind, there was a chance he would overtake his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian looked up and frowned. The sensing treasure connected to Jing Guanjin was silent right now. His thoughts raced and he was left overjoyed. Could Jing Guanjin be hiding some other hidden card?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, this must be what was happening. If he had stopped right now, then he must be saving his energy…for the final stretch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was indeed worthy of being that mighty figure’s most cherished descendant. His formidable strength was truly startling. If Jing Guanjin hadn’t met a freak like that Ning fellow, he would have already won. In fact, he wouldn’t have even needed to have people ambush Sea Lingdao. With Jing Guanjin’s strength, he could have seized a Purple Card himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian sat straight and steady. He waited for his disciple to turn the tides in the final critical moments and shock all the old fogies watching. He looked around every now and then. Although he didn’t reveal an expression, he sneered inwardly. Just wait and see – this competition isn’t over yet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two Purple Cards that were on good terms with Wu Zetian. They had received an immense amount of benefits from him and had authorized him to use the power of inspection. Right now, they couldn’t help but be curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wu, your disciple hasn’t moved in a long time. Is everything alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Zetian’s complexion was inscrutable. “Don’t worry, Jing Guanjin is fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His disciple had struck the spirit shell so hard that he could clearly feel his firm resolve and power from this distance. He surely had to be in good spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wu, there still isn’t any movement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough cough…Brother Wu, it’s almost daytime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wu, the competition will end soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Wu, the competition has ended.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What…nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian stamped his feet. “It was almost afternoon when the match began two days ago. There should still be four hours, so how could it have possibly ended!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were on good terms, everyone here was a Purple Card sea spirit teacher and were dignified characters. They certainly didn’t like being scolded in public. The man said, “His Majesty personally passed down the other. He said that if the competition continues on, people will die…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The message had been delivered a moment ago. Because Grandmaster Wu Zetian’s attention was completely focused, he hadn’t noticed this. He was left in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Purple Cards looked at him with especially strange expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Wu Zetian suddenly regained his thoughts. He stood up and rushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Majesty had said that people would die if the competition continued. He was clearly referring to the two competitors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Jing Guanjin already hadn’t made any movements for a long time…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rushed out of the royal palace and out of the palace gates. Beneath the bell that had stood there for countless years, Wu Zetian watched what was happening with a deeply pained look. He watched as his proud and confident disciple was lifted onto a stretcher and brought down the altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Guanjin’s robes were almost completely soaked in blood. That dazzling red ignited a flame in Grandmaster Wu Zetian’s chest, fed with rage and anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who was it!? Who did it!? Who injured my disciple! With so many people watching, you dare to injure someone in the finals of the great competition! Your courage is higher than the heavens!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grandmaster’s roars attracted countless eyes. The audience that had been waiting patiently for two days were immediately sent into a frenzy. They all shouted out their support for the grandmaster and demanded that the committee give them an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The competition committee soon responded. Just as Grandmaster Wu Zetian’s roar faded away, a number of committee members appeared with awkward expressions. The one leading them was committee member Goodra. There was no other way about it. Everyone knew that the turtle race possessed powerful defensive abilities, so of course he had been given the task of explaining. If he was beaten up, at least he could protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the others from the committee gave their greetings, including the stoic Chairman Xu, committee member Goodra shrunk down his head and said, “Grandmaster Wu, I ask you to please be patient. We have already investigated the injury and have verified that no one attacked him. Rather, he…struck himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
