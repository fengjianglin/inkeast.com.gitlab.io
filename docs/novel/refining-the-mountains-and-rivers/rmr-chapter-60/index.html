 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With magic power purity and strength that could compare to a sixth level Golden Core, with the infinite might of the Demon Body, and also with his extraordinary divine sense added on, these factors combined together allowed Qin Yu to completely overwhelm Deepsea Demon. When fighting against those at a higher realm, unless one possessed a heaven-defying bloodline or a formidable inheritance, it had never been easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deepsea Demon roared out again and again, but fear began to grow in the depths of his mind. As the punches continued, his wounds gradually accumulated and worsened. If things continued like this, it wouldn’t be long before he was beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to run away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As this thought formed, Deepsea Demon felt profound shame, so much that his eyes turned red. But soon it vanished. Compared to death, what was losing a bit of face for some time? In these past days his cultivation seemed to unwind, a faint indication that he was nearing a breakthrough. With the great dao of Nascent Soul so close to hand, he would truly be aggrieved if he were to die here like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a true man, taking revenge 10 years later wouldn’t be considered late at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As this reasoning formed, Deepsea Demon roared out once more. The black turtle shell above his head quickly shrank and its imprisoning range also contracted with it. Finally, it locked Qin Yu into a space of 20 feet. With eyes filled with anxiety, Deepsea Demon turned tail and fled. This was because he knew that the imprisonment of the turtle shell wouldn’t be able to stop Qin Yu. At most it could give him several breaths more time to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Billowing demonic energy wrapped around him as he shot into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yunmo cried out miserably and turned to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four other demonic Golden Core cultivators were a bit faster in responding; they were already a thousand feet away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demonic cultivators in Canyondwell City had been left in chaos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was absolute humiliation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A late Golden Core and five other Golden Core powerhouses, for a total of six demonic path masters, had been scared away by a single Golden Core cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What happened to bringing back the dignity of the demonic path?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a heaven-shaking explosion the turtle shell burst into pieces. Qin Yu stepped out, slaughter energy rising all up over his body, his killing intent immediately locking onto Deepsea Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deepsea Demon felt his courage collapse. He knew that the turtle shell couldn’t stop Qin Yu, but how did he get out so quickly? Moreover, why was he chasing after him with such singular focus? Li Yunmo also had a grudge with Qin Yu, and there were four other bright and shining Golden Core demonic cultivators standing beside him. Killing them would be as simple as turning a hand, so why was he still being chased!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood red flames ignited. Qin Yu’s speed suddenly rose up ten times over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Deepsea Demon was drowning in despair, a troop of demonic cultivators appeared in the distance, their scarlet flags fluttering in the end. A powerful aura rose and whipped up clouds and winds. The sounds of rumbling thunder followed. Deepsea Demon’s eyes widened as he reveled in joy. He shouted out loud, “Sect Master, save me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the all-out strength of a late Golden Core master, his voice instantly spread through the world. Li Yunmo and the four Golden Core demonic cultivators also stopped as they heard this. As they discovered the troop that was quickly approaching, they suddenly turned back around to join the battle, their faces filled with fearless fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You insolent child Qin Yu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will never forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if I must perish with you, I won’t let you take a single step out of Canyondwell City!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voices were vigorous and angry, as if they were worried they couldn’t spread out far enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But…the problem was that Qin Yu was already outside of Canyondwell City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deepsea Demon’s lips twitched. These five bastards. However, he didn’t have the time or desire to lower himself to their level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharpness reappeared in his eyes. As his eagle-like gaze locked onto Qin Yu, all of his shame and resentment was transformed into vicious killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qin Yu, I remember that you were close with that little girl right? Once you die, I vow that I will capture her and make her suffer a fate worse than death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deepsea Demon valiantly shouted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The carriage of the Seven Slaughter Sect Master had arrived and Qin Yu was doomed to die. Even if he were to stand here motionlessly, how could he even be killed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu swept his eyes over the incoming troop, his gaze deep as he veered back to Deepsea Demon. “I won’t give you that chance. Let’s end this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deepsea Demon’s heart violently shrank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu lifted a hand and pointed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boundless Blue Finger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Winds rose up between the heaven and earth, split apart by this finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the blood in Deepsea Demon’s face instantly faded away. The cultivation of a late Golden Core master wildly erupted as endless layers of demonic energy wrapped around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The doors of the carriage burst open and a middle-aged man in blood red robes stepped out. His vision was dire and surging with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person was the master of the Seven Slaughter Demon Sect, Heavenstar Demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Boundless Blue Finger fell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The layers of demonic energy shivered and collapsed, revealing the deathly white face of Deepsea Demon and his eyes filled with unwillingness. Deepsea Demon lowered his head with effort. A giant hole had appeared in his chest. Blood crazily gushed out, and the heart that should have been robustly beating had vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu spread out his arms. Deepsea Demon suddenly emitted a terrifying cry and his face twisted in fear as his body began to quickly wither. Rich blood energy drilled out from all the pores of his body, quickly gathering in the air and turning into a strange demonic face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenstar Demon’s complexion changed. This…this was…he sucked in a deep breath, calming his racing heart. His eyes started to gradually heat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hu –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black flames rose up, swallowing the demonic face and wiping it from existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this occur, Qin Yu felt a knot relax in his heart, as if one of his annoying karmic ties had dispersed because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">12 columns of demonic energy rose up into the skies as if they supported the heavens. The entire area was suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenstar Demon walked through the void. The aura of a Nascent Soul blotted out the skies. “Junior Qin Yu, you have killed a powerhouse of my demonic path and today you will not escape!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A demon hand formed from thin air. It was extremely black and seemed as if it were formed from some kind of jade, but one could clearly see the lines and print of the palm. It was like the hand of a great demon had reached across the river of time to grab at Qin Yu! All of the demonic cultivators in Canyondwell City felt their heart rates accelerate, so excited they couldn’t control themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, there was someone in the demonic path that could turn the tides!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven Slaughter Sect Master was a super powerhouse at the Nascent Soul realm. It would be far too easy for him to kill Qin Yu! Ha! You damned brat, no matter how arrogant and rampant you were, it's time for your retribution!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu’s complexion was earnest. As the pressure of the Nascent Soul realm pressed down on him, all the bones in his body seemed to creak and moan. He hadn’t expected that after refining these tools just recently, he would have to use them to preserve his life so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a flick of his sleeve, 108 strange fish teeth were suspended in front of Qin Yu. As he pointed out his finger, they began to shoot through the skies in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first strange fish tooth exploded, then the second, third, and fourth. Although the demon hand was powerful it still couldn’t stand up to such a terrifying barrage. Cracks appeared in it and it immediately collapsed. Before the rumbling sounds faded, the demon hand was torn apart and the remaining strange fish teeth shot straight at Heavenstar Demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Storm Flow!” Heavenstar Demon shouted out in anger. With a wave of his sleeve an expanse of demonic energy appeared in the skies, stars seeming to sparkle within it. As the strange fish teeth crashed into it, it seemed as if they had entered a completely different space. Although they still wildly exploded, they couldn’t harm him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, there was a price to pay for this. Heavenstar Demon was forced back again and again until he was forced outside the 12 columns of demonic energy. As he stepped past the threshold, the 12 columns instantly became blurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blood Escape Art activated and blazing demonic flames wrapped around Qin Yu. Qin Yu slammed into the invisible seal. As he spat out a mouthful of blood, he successfully pushed past the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh –</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure rapidly faded into the distance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenstar Demon’s face darkened. He reached out and grabbed a ball of blood. As he smelled it, flames ignited in his eyes. He had only been guessing before, but now he was sure of it. This was the Demon Body, this was definitely the Demon Body! However, Qin Yu had already run far away, and with him crazily burning his blood essence to utilize the speed of the Blood Escape Art, there was no way he could overtake him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pass down an order to the entire sect. Find him! He must be found no matter the cost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Skyvault City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Southern Empire, the number one cultivation faction was the pill giant known as Immortal Eclipse Valley. However, in the eyes of the cultivators of the Southern Empire, Skyvault City had the highest and loftiest status. It was built atop a natural flying stone and was a genuine city in the skies. Its inheritance stretched back almost 10,000 years, and even though Immortal Eclipse Valley was stronger, they still couldn’t take over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, this was the safest place within the boundaries of the Southern Empire. Skyvault City forbade battles between any cultivators and also had a natural array formation that repelled any demonic cultivators who tried to enter. As for those that had housing in the city, all of them possessed formidable backgrounds and statuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhu Family was one of the powerful families of the Southern Empire that possessed the qualifications to live within Skyvault City. Their family had an inheritance that spanned 10 generations, and although their powerhouses had risen and fallen over the times, they currently had three Golden Core masters propping them up. They had joined formidable sects and their complex network of influence couldn’t be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time Qin Yu appeared in front of the Zhu Family Mansion, requesting a visit. His black robe completely hid his figure. Although he was deliberately hiding his status, his Golden Core aura caused the guards at the mansion gates to look at him with respect. This was especially true because this person had stated that he was an old friend of Lord Bluecloud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of the Zhu Family’s three Golden Cores, Zhu Bluecloud had the lowest cultivation and the highest potential. He was favored by everyone in the family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please wait a moment my lord. I will immediately pass on the message.” A guard quickly left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, underneath the shocked gazes of the remaining guards, Zhu Bluecloud walked over. He loudly asked, “Where is the one requesting an audience?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled. He cupped his hands together, “Brother Zhu, it’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud immediately lit up with joy. “You…” His eyes brightened with awareness. “Come with me!” He turned and led Qin Yu into the Zhu Family Mansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they entered, Zhu Bluecloud directly asked, “Are you the one who killed Deepsea Demon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu pulled down his hood and smiled. “Nope.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud let out a long breath. “I was also asked how it could possibly be you. It hasn’t been that long and yet you killed Deepsea Demon? And, some people even said that the Seven Slaughter Sect Master Heavenstar Demon personally arrived but still couldn’t hold you behind. This is just far too ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu’s smile remained unchanged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the blink of an eye, Zhu Bluecloud continued to speak. “But, the key point is that besides you, who would chase after Deepsea Demon and try to kill him no matter the cost? You can be honest with me. Ever since I obtained the news I haven’t been able to get a good night’s rest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you think it was me, it was me. If you think it wasn’t, then it wasn’t.” Qin Yu blinked his eyes, not directly replying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud’s eyes widened and his jaw nearly dropped to the floor. Although he didn’t say anything, one could imagine just how many curses he was flinging in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long time, Zhu Bluecloud took a deep breath and composed himself. “You…you…you damned freak!” He grumbled. He had just made a breakthrough in his cultivation and thought that the gap between him and Qin Yu had narrowed, but he didn’t think that just after blinking his eyes he would be flung back so far he couldn’t even see him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu laughed, “Alright, I came here for a reason. You should know what it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud curled his lips. “Don’t worry, I had Gu Ling’er enter the Rainbow Sect and also had people arrange for her to live in Skyvault City. She is very safe here. Moreover, now that you’ve killed Deepsea Demon I don’t think anyone else knows about your relationship to her.” After a brief pause he added, “Do you want me to send someone to bring Gu Ling’er back for a visit so that you can see her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu hesitated. He shook his head, “I won’t see her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud was left speechless. “In order to save her, you first killed Liang Taizu and then killed Deepsea Demon. Right now, the entire Seven Slaughter Demon Sect is going crazy searching the world for you. You paid such a deep price and yet you don’t want to see her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled. “Even if I just see her one time, she will be in that much more danger. As long as she is safe it doesn’t matter if I see her or not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud nodded. “Well it’s your business, so you make the decisions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu cupped his hands across his chest. “Brother Zhu, I fear that I will have to continue to bother you in the future to take care of Ling’er. Allow me to apologize in advance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud waved his hand, coughing, half-real and half-fake. “Right now you’re considered a very large thigh and my Zhu Family can’t even wait to develop relations with you, so how could it be trouble for us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled. “If you need help in the future, I will try as long as it is in my power to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a vow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there was a limit, it was because of this that it seemed more sincere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud was overjoyed, “I’ll remember!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally there were some veiled criticisms within the family about how he had used up family favors to send Gu Ling’er into the Rainbow Sect. Once some rumors were spread out, he’d see just who would continue flapping their lips. Qin Yu also guessed this, thus he promised them a favor in return. Friends helped friends and one should always return favors. This was how human relationships worked in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, we’re not resting until we're drunk tonight!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled and agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After drinking for a long time, they also ate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhu Bluecloud used the boldness provided by alcohol to interrogate Qin Yu. For instance, how did Qin Yu’s strength rise so quickly so soon? Of course, all he received was smoke for answers. Zhu Bluecloud raged in righteous indignation, but Qin Yu simply laughed and paid him no heed. In truth, they both knew that these words were also spoken to closen their relationship, and both knew that it was impossible to truly say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After drinking, Qin Yu bid his farewells. Zhu Bluecloud tried to have him stay a bit longer, but it was useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Rainbow Sect’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu stood at a street entrance. After waiting for two hours he finally saw Gu Ling’er. She was standing within a crowd of female cultivators, and although she was still shy she was much more confident than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young girl, she seemed to have grown up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yu smiled and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Ling’er suddenly turned her head, a puzzled look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it Ling’er?” A senior-apprentice sister asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Ling’er bit her lips. She looked around, but that feeling was no longer here. For some reason, it had felt as if her heart was empty, like it was missing a piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
