 <p>Chapter 481: Strike to Kill, Intimidate to Scare Away</p>
 <p>“Pcht!!”</p>
 <p>To Wu Han’s pleasant surprise, Bai Yunfei ‘slammed’ into the icy spear without without dodging! The spear perforated Bai Yunfei, running through his back so that he was completely impaled on it!</p>
 <p>His excitement didn’t last long, however. Not even a second after Bai Yunfei impaled himself, Wu Han watched as Bai Yunfei’s body fade away into thin air!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s body was gone without a trace! It was almost as if he had been an illusion since the very beginning.</p>
 <p>Then the next thing he knew, a burning heatwave in the shape of two crimson spears flew at him from his left and right!</p>
 <p>The +12 additional effect of the Fire-tipped Spear, Doppelganger!</p>
 <p>Left with very little time to think, Wu Han summoned even more elemental ice from his essence iceseed to form an icy carapace over his body. In another burst of energy, his right arm swung to the left, slamming his icy spear into the enemy to his right.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The spear slammed into Bai Yunfei’s waist, sending him flying a good distance away before disappearing from sight just like the one that had been impaled!</p>
 <p>The spear coming at him from the left was left unimpeded however. It struck the icy carapace of elemental ice over Wu Han’s body, and then….stabbed through it without a problem!</p>
 <p>It was as if the carapace didn’t even exist! Shearing through it like it was nothing, the spear stabbed Wu Han straight into the heart!</p>
 <p>“Pccht!!”</p>
 <p>The following sound was like a clap of thunder to Wu Han’s ears. His body froze up in pain, and lowering his head down slightly, he looked on as a red spear perforated him where his heart was in dread.</p>
 <p>The +13 additional effect of the Fire-tipped Spear, the ability to ignore elemental defenses!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>There was an explosion as the elemental ice around Wu Han’s body lost the soulforce binding it together. Exploding into thousands of tiny pieces of ice, the ice broke away to reveal Bai Yunfei standing near Wu Han with his spear stabbed straight through the latter.</p>
 <p>Both Xing Qiugu and Xing Qiufeng felt as if a bombshell had been dropped onto their heads when they saw Wu Han killed by Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Then, Bai Yunfei turned his head and stalked straight for them.</p>
 <p>How strange it was, that the fire in Bai Yunfei’s eyes were burning hotter than anything, but all the two felt was a chilling frost in their own hearts. Feelings of apprehension shot straight through their hearts when they saw Bai Yunfei stare at them, and the killing intent he directed towards them!</p>
 <p>These men were with the Soul Refining School. Even if they weren’t a part of the school, they were just as bad! So it was without remorse that Bai Yunfei decided to kill them as well.</p>
 <p>The late-stage Soul Exalt Xing Qiufeng was the first to respond. Sensing Bai Yunfei’s murderous rage, his face went pale and took several steps back in retreat!</p>
 <p>“That Wu Han has nothing to do with the house of Liu!! He is not one of us! Young sire, spare the innocent from your wrathful slaughter! The blue-eyes wyrm is yours, we shall leave at once!” He cried out, trying to appease Bai Yunfei’s anger. He could guess that there was something between Wu Han and Bai Yunfei to cause such hatred, so he tried to remove themselves away from the equation to avoid Bai Yunfei’s wrath.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stared frostily at them, not saying a word and not moving at all. Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm did nothing either and retreated to move behind Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei didn’t come over, Xing Qiufeng sighed in relief. Without delay, he and Xing Qiugu took the others and left the place.</p>
 <p>Wu Han’s death startled them more than they’d like. He had been a late-stage Soul Exalt, and yet all it took to kill him was a short three minutes! And the one to kill him was a man who looked like he was only a mid-stage Soul Exalt! And then in the middle of the battle, the very same mid-stage Soul Exalt became a peak late-stage Soul Exalt with a snap of his fingers.</p>
 <p>Everyone had the same thought when he did that: to escape from the area as fast as possible.</p>
 <p>Watching as the group left, Bai Yunfei did nothing else but wait. He knew these people weren’t from the Soul Refining School, so fighting them wasn’t wise. It wouldn’t be easy to kill them all, and if by chance he didn’t and his Berserk Mode ran out, he’d be left in very dire straits.</p>
 <p>He only wished to save the blue-eyes wyrm and kill the soul refiner. Aside from that, Bai Yunfei no longer felt inclined to kill the men from the Liu.</p>
 <p>Dispelling his Berserk Mode, Bai Yunfei allowed for the stockpiled soulforce in his Violet Soul Ring to fill his body, making up for the soulforce he used in such a short amount of time.</p>
 <p>He tossed Wu Han’s corpse unceremoniously to the ground as if he would with trash before returning back to his normal expression.</p>
 <p>He of course, pocketed the space ring and weapon Wu Han had first.</p>
 <p>He looked to Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm behind it.</p>
 <p>“Let’s leave this place first.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Half a day later, by a small river relatively far away from the hill.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei sat on top of a large stone, watching as the fish he caught earlier cook on top of the open fire. Not too far away, Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm were ‘conversing’ with one another through a series of chirps and grumbles.</p>
 <p>Halfway through their talks, the blue-eyes wyrm was able to smell the cooked piece of fish Bai Yunfei was cooking and walked towards Bai Yunfei, its mouth slightly agape with drool.</p>
 <p>“Ah….after a year of not seeing you, you seem to gotten smarter!” Bai Yunfei laughed. He tossed the fished over to the wyrm, who caught it in his claws before devouring it.</p>
 <p>He watched the blue-eyes wyrm eat curiously. As he said, the wyrm in front of him was clearly a lot ‘smarter’ than from a year ago. Whether it was the light in its eyes or its human-like characteristics, the wyrm was acting a lot more like how the red magiboar back in the Crafting School acted. This was a sign that its intelligence was at a very high level.</p>
 <p>How strange. What kind of action would it take for such a drastic change like this to occur within a year?</p>
 <p>And yet, its increase in strength was the real anomaly. Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi were already considered deviants with how quickly they improved by being able to improve from the early-stage class six/Soul Exalt level to the midstage level. But the blue-eyes wyrm was able to go from an early-stage class six to a late-stage class six….</p>
 <p>“What in the world did you come across?” Bai Yunfei asked, “We said goodbye to each other a very long ways away from here, why in the world are you here?”</p>
