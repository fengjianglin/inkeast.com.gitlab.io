 <p>Chapter 355: A Meeting of Foes</p>
 <p>“The Glacial School!!”</p>
 <p>The expression on Bai Yunfei’s face grew rigid at the very mention of that school. For a moment, Bai Yunfei did nothing but stare off into the distance.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei then latched onto Mo Xiaoxuan’s shoulders and asked him in a slightly louder voice than normal, “What school did you say was here!?”</p>
 <p>“The… the Glacial School? Brother Bai, what’s wrong?” Frightened nearly out of his skin, Mo Xiaoxuan could hardly respond coherently.</p>
 <p>Even Tang Xinyun was surprised that Bai Yunfei would experience such a major reaction. Tugging at his robes, she asked, “Yunfei, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Realizing where he was, Bai Yunfei immediately let go of Mo Xiaoxuan’s shoulder apologetically, “Sorry about that, I let my emotions get the best of me…”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine, there’s no need for brother Bai to apologize,” Grimacing when he touched his pained shoulders, Mo Xiaoxuan asked, “Hss… brother Bai, you’re really strong you know… but what’s going on? Why did you get so excited at the name of that school? Do you know them or something?”</p>
 <p>Like Mo Xiaoxuan, Tang Xinyun stared anxiously at Bai Yunfei, waiting for an answer.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded and stayed silent for a moment as he thought of what to say. He sighed before starting to talk, “Yeah, I don’t know why I didn’t tell you before, but I’m from the Azure Cloud Province. Back then… I experienced a scuffle with the Glacial School where they tried to kill me…”</p>
 <p>“What!?” Mo Xiaoxuan angrily roared, “The Glacial School dared to do such a thing!? I’ll notify senior Tiechui at once and drive them from the school! No! That’d be too easy! I’ll make sure our seniors teach them a lesson!”</p>
 <p>After turning to run back to Li Tiechui, Mo Xiaoxuan found himself immediately stopped by Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai, why are you stopping me?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“Oh! I get it, you want to be the one to teach them a lesson! Okay! You’re super strong after all. You could beat them all and still have enough energy to spare, I’ll lead you to them! It’s time for revenge! Even if you killed them all, I’m sure the headmaster and the others would be more than happy to allow it!”</p>
 <p>“Hold on, Xiaoxuan, don’t be too hasty.” Bai Yunfei shook his head. “Forget about it…”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mo Xiaoxuan couldn’t believe his ears, “Brother Bai, what are you saying!? What do you mean forget about it? Didn’t you say they tried to kill you? How could you say ‘forget about it’ then!?”</p>
 <p>“The past is the past, I don’t want to bother myself with it anymore…” Bai Yunfei smiled, “Besides, they’re here to pay our school a visit. Brother Li received them and it’d only hurt our reputation if I caused troubled in the school. I can’t allow my personal grudges affect the name of our Crafting School.”</p>
 <p>It was true that Bai Yunfei felt a strong urge to rush over to where the Glacial School was when he heard that name. Furthermore, he was also feeling the urge to do what Mo Xiaoxuan had said: to beat and maybe even kill a few of them to satisfy his revenge.</p>
 <p>When he calmed down, that line of thinking was sealed back into his mind. He wasn’t an ignorant child of the world anymore. This was the Crafting School he was living in. The Glacial School were the guests. If a guest were to be attacked here rather than be treated well, wouldn’t that sully the name of the Crafting School?</p>
 <p>Even if the elders were to allow him to kill the ones from the Glacial School here, he wouldn’t want to do it.. He didn’t want to take advantage of their kindness and repay them with a dirty reputation.</p>
 <p>In fact, his grudge wasn’t even with the Glacial School. It was with the Zhang. Not to mention it wasn’t in his nature to want to kill the entire Glacial School.</p>
 <p>Should he come across them elsewhere, well, there was interest that needed to be collected.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, what are you going to do?” Nervous of his silence, Tang Xinyun asked to hear his answer.</p>
 <p>When he turned around to answer, a gentle smile greeted his gaze; it almost looked as though she would support him and any choice he made.</p>
 <p>“Haha, it’s nothing, let’s get going, Xinyun.” Bai Yunfei smiled. “Xiaoxuan, try not to think about this. Hurry and do what you need to do.”</p>
 <p>“Are you really going to let things go here? Brother Bai…” It looked as if there was still something Mo Xiaoxuan wanted to say, but Bai Yunfei had already turned to leave. Thus, he shut his mouth, but he wasn’t convinced.</p>
 <p><em>“Bai Yunfei really is far too generous.”</em></p>
 <p>Despite Bai Yunfei’s reaction, Mo Xiaoxuan was already starting to think of a plan to take care of the Glacial School himself, to vent Bai Yunfei’s anger for him.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Yunfei had only taken a few footsteps away from Mo Xiaoxuan when he noticed something strange. Stopping in place, he turned to face the rightmost part of the Southern Point.</p>
 <p>Four figures could be seen walking toward him from several hundred meters away. Out of the four, one of them was Li Tiechui. On his immediate right were two people. One was a young man perhaps twenty-seven years old. He wasn’t someone Bai Yunfei recognized, but he knew who the other person was; the headmaster of the Glacial School, Yu Fei!!</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man on Li Tiechui’s left was… Zhang Zhenshan!!</p>
 <p>When the four saw him, both Yu Fei and Zhang Zhenshan immediately went stiff. They became slackjawed. Li Tiechui and the other young man with him on the other hand, stopped to give the two men questioning looks.</p>
 <p>Before Li Tiechui could even ask what was wrong, Zhang Zhenshan’s body started to dangerously shiver. His eyes were glaring daggers at his most hated enemy, and his lips curled into a malevolent snarl.</p>
 <p>Under Li Tiechui’s startled eyes, an explosion of soulforce materialized from Zhang Zhenshan’s body before he pounced straight for Bai Yunfei like a tiger attacking its prey!</p>
 <p>“Bai! Yun! Fei!!!”</p>
 <p>One by one, the words roared from Zhang Zhenshan’s lips were practically dripping with the hatred the man felt for Bai Yunfei. The aura around his body was growing thicker by the second, and icicles were already starting to formulate around his right palm where a layer of frost had formed.</p>
 <p>The distance dividing the two foes was traversed in practically moments. Zhang Zhenshan hadn’t even finished pronouncing Bai Yunfei’s name when he was nearly on top of Bai Yunfei. Up in the air now, his right palm extended out. He was prepared to crash down on Bai Yunfei’s head with the power of ice!</p>
 <p>The Glacial Palm!!</p>
 <p>The utter suddenness had caught everyone off guard, even Bai Yunfei was at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>He was still the first one there to regain his bearings. Narrowing his eyes when the Glacial Palm drew close, he lashed out with a punch of his own, right as the palm was about to connect with him!</p>
 <p>“Pow!!”</p>
 <p>A halo of red light danced to life with the flurry of frost when the two hands made contact. Bai Yunfei’s right leg was pushed back just half a step while Zhang Zhenshan was sent unceremoniously flying ten meters back.</p>
 <p>“Stop!!”</p>
 <p>A voice called out; there was a blur as someone appeared in between Bai Yunfei and Zhang Zhenshan. Li Tiechui stared ominously at Zhang Zhenshan who was still glaring daggers at Bai Yunfei, “Zhang Zhenshan, what is the meaning of this?”</p>
 <p>“Zhang Zhenshan, stop!!” At the same time, Yu Fei managed to finally call out to him to stop.</p>
 <p>Their words fell on deaf ears. Zhang Zhenshan looked as crazed as ever as he stared at his most hated enemy with bloodshot eyes.</p>
 <p>Rather than pull back his aura, Zhang Zhenshan pushed off against the ground so that he could get around Li Tiechui and go straight for Bai Yunfei!!</p>
 <p>“Hmph!” Since his warning had been ignored, Li Tiechui flared his soulforce and prepared to forcibly stop the man.</p>
 <p>It was then that Li Tiechui heard the calm voice of Bai Yunfei right behind him, “Brother Li, this is a personal enemy of mine. If you could please refrain from doing anything here.”</p>
 <p>“What?” He turned his head behind to look at Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>His distraction was taken advantage of by Zhang Zhenshan. Maneuvering around him, Zhang Zhenshan was now in front of Bai Yunfei. The back of his right hand had a blade of ice about three meters tall stuck to it.</p>
 <p>With a furious roar, he plunged it toward Bai Yunfei’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Bai Yunfei! Give me back my son’s life!!”</p>
