 <p>Chapter 358: Returning a Tiger to Its Mountain?</p>
 <p>Yu Fei was really scared. The events that had transpired within the past few minutes were enough to almost cause him to have a mental breakdown, but he hadn’t the ability to think of anything else but to protect his own life and the life of the Glacial School!</p>
 <p>Resentment for Zhang Zhenshan was building because of those two things.</p>
 <p><em>“It’s all because of <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span>. If you hadn’t tried to anger this Bai Yunfei, we wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place!”</em></p>
 <p>His announcement astonished everyone there, even Zhang Zhenshan who was still on the ground. The man had been so startled by the announcement that the anger in his eyes bled away, replaced with disbelief.</p>
 <p>Only Mo Ni was different from the others. The announcement caught him off guard for a second, but a smile soon reappeared on his face. He gave both Bai Yunfei and Zhang Zhenshan a good look as if he was watching a very amusing play.</p>
 <p>“You’re… expelling me from the Glacial School??” Zhang Zhenshan repeated ominously.</p>
 <p>For a while, Zhang Zhenshan did and said nothing.</p>
 <p>Then he broke out in laughter, “Haha! You’re expelling me from the school? Fine, so be it then!! Rather than help me get revenge on my son’s killer, you expel me from the school! I’ve worked hard for years for the school, yet it all falls apart during your one moment of fear! Are you that afraid of the Crafting School to severe your connections with me? Very well then… pftt!!”</p>
 <p>The emotions Zhang Zhenshan was feeling were far too much for his body to take. Another mouthful of blood was expelled from his mouth, but he continued to glare and sneer with bitter resentment.</p>
 <p>With blood sprinkled on him, the man looked half insane.</p>
 <p>“Sigh…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei chose then to let out a sudden sigh. Having lost any will to fight, Bai Yunfei looked at the man below him.</p>
 <p>“You should go…”</p>
 <p>“What??”</p>
 <p>Another startling announcement.</p>
 <p>Up to that point, everyone—Tang Xinyun included—had thought that Bai Yunfei wouldn’t spare the Glacial School after earning the rapport of Kou Changkong.</p>
 <p>At the very least, Zhang Zhenshan of all people wouldn’t be forgiven.</p>
 <p>Yet, here Bai Yunfei was, forgiving the man after a moment of thought!</p>
 <p>It was with a surprised smile that Kou Changkong turned to look at Bai Yunfei. He knew that Bai Yunfei valued the Crafting School’s name very highly and wouldn’t do anything that might besmirch it, even if it meant letting go of his own personal grudges.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter if Bai Yunfei’s choice was right or wrong, Kou Changkong was proud of Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>It really went to show just how much Bai Yunfei valued the school.</p>
 <p>Like everyone else, Zhang Zhenshan couldn’t believe his ears. His eyes stared darkly at Bai Yunfei, trying to find a hint of trickery, but when there was none to be had, he sneered and struggled to his feet before making his way down the mountain.</p>
 <p>There was no barrage of attacks or any clichèd vows of revenge. He seemed almost lost, like a person who had lost their sight and had stumbled forward.</p>
 <p>“Sire… sire Bai…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei heard a hesitant voice from behind when he was back at Tang Xinyun’s side.</p>
 <p>Turning his head, he was greeted with the sight of an embarrassed Yu Fei.</p>
 <p>“Is there something you want?” Bai Yunfei asked.</p>
 <p>His current appearance wasn’t something Yu Fei felt very confident about. Thinking quickly about what to say, Yu Fei respectfully said, “Sire Bai… I was blind to not see Mt. Tai. I was poisoned by Zhang Zhenshan’s words and offended you. Please… please take pity on this one and take mercy on my school…</p>
 <p>Author Note: This is an idiom meant for its contextual meaning, disregard the fact that no ‘Mt. Tai’ exists in this world.</p>
 <p>Those words were said after plenty of struggling, but when he saw the utterly impassive look on Bai Yunfei’s face, Yu Fei’s face fell for a moment.</p>
 <p>Knowing that something had to be done, Yu Fei gritted his teeth and raised his right arm. With a powerful soulforce-infused palm strike, he smashed his palm into his left shoulder!</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>Straight away, the sound of several bones being snapped could be heard to everyone as his left arm drooped uselessly by his side. This palm strike of his had destroyed the bones in his shoulder, and although it wasn’t enough to render the arm useless, it’d still take several months before it’d regain full mobility.</p>
 <p>“Father! Why did you do that?!” The young man next to Yu Fei cried out in fright.</p>
 <p>Raising his only arm to stop his son from trying to heal his shoulder, Yu Fei looked back to Bai Yunfei with an extremely pale face, “This one will apologize thusly. By sire Bai’s will, please forgive my Glacial School….”</p>
 <p>His voice was miserable to listen to, but it was rather understandable. In the Azure Cloud Province, he was the headmaster of a rather glorious school, but here he stood begging for forgiveness from a twenty-something year old.</p>
 <p>Though miserable, there wasn’t anything else he could do.</p>
 <p>His Glacial School was a minor school while the Crafting School was one of the top ten. Who wouldn’t know and respect them?</p>
 <p>Studying the man’s expression for a little bit, Bai Yunfei finally turned an eye to Lin Dongxiao, “Since the junior headmaster of the Beast Taming School has already asked for lenience, let’s leave this matter as it stands. From today on, there is no ill will between your Glacial School and me.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, my thanks for your leniency, brother Bai.” Lin Dongxiao smiled, though the thoughts in his mind were nowhere as cheerful.</p>
 <p><em>“You weren’t even planning to do anything since the beginning, yet you’re pretending like you’ve just done me a huge favor. You hypocrite.”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded, but nothing else was said to him.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother, since this matter is over, I’ll be going now…” Bai Yunfei said to Kou Changkong.</p>
 <p>“Haha, very well then. I’ll take care of the rest of the matters here.” Kou Changkong nodded, “You did well, Yunfei…” he added on.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your praise, but since I am a crafter, how could I possibly do anything that’d harm our school’s reputation?” Bai Yunfei nodded before taking Tang Xinyun with him to the Eastern Point.</p>
 <p>It was only after the two had left that Yu Fei was able to sigh in relief. Bowing deeply to Kou Changkong, he said, “Headmaster Kou, this junior won’t disturb you any longer. We’ll be taking our leave then…”</p>
 <p>He didn’t wish to stay here any longer. He wanted to leave right away and get back to the Azure Cloud Province.</p>
 <p>Back to his Glacial School.</p>
 <p>His own territory.</p>
 <p>“One moment.” Before Yu Fei and his son could get far, Kou Changkong suddenly spoke to them again.</p>
 <p>Yu Fei’s face paled again, “Headmaster Kou… is there something you need?</p>
 <p>“Haha, don’t feel so flustered, headmaster Yu. If Yunfei says his grudge is over, then his grudge is over, and by extension, you of the Glacial School will remain our guests.</p>
 <p>“Your school came here to request some soul armaments and we’ve already agreed to your request, so please stay a few days as you had planned. We’ll be done with your request and will send you down the mountain after that.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Yu Fei didn’t know what to think, but all he do was relent. “Then, we shall do as you say, headmaster Kou…”</p>
 <p>Now that the matter was dealt with and Li Tiechui was leading the Glacial School away, Kou Changkong dismissed the students gathered around the area. He then talked to Lin Dongxiao and Mo Ni. “This old man will be going now, please do as you wish now.”</p>
 <p>“Senior Kou doesn’t need to worry about us. The two of us were just about to go on a small stroll…”</p>
 <p>A frustrated sigh erupted from Lin Dongxiao’s lips when Kou Changkong was safely out of sight, “How fucking annoying. We came to see the fireworks, but somehow we now owe a ‘favor’ to that Bai Yunfei. He had to have done that on purpose! He even said he was doing it since I asked… pah! What friendship, bite me!! How unlucky, let’s hurry up and go back… brother Mo, what are you staring at?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s nothing… haha. Brother Lin, don’t feel so angry. Bai Yunfei was probably just saying whatever first came to his mind, so you don’t owe him any favors. Let’s wait until our soul armaments are done being crafted, then we can go back home.”</p>
 <p>Mo Ni looked away from where he was staring. He smiled at Lin Dongxiao before following him in another direction…</p>
