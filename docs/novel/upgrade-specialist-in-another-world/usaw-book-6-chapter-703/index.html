 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

The longer Bai Yunfei waited, the faster the mud started to flow downwards. Much to Bai Yunfei’s own surprise, the mud wasn’t the only thing flowing, he was starting to sink down with it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even within the barrier, Bai Yunfei felt like a bubble of air deep underwater. With all of the water flowing against him, Bai Yunfei was being battered around with the pressure of all the water on top of him trying to force Bai Yunfei and the barrier downwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The motions of the water and everything around Bai Yunfei would’ve sent any lesser person into motion sickness and black out. But after Bai Yunfei managed to recover from his shock, Bai Yunfei transmitted more of his soulforce into the barrier. A pulse of elemental earth was released from the barrier, stopping the water from pushing him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei looked back to the roof with a curious light. Sending the Cataclysmic Seal back up, Bai Yunfei leapt up to try and force his way through the roof!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, the roof used to be as hard as stone and break apart when struck. But now that it was soft due to the surrounding liquid, the roof wasn’t exploding apart anymore. Still, Bai Yunfei was able to force his way through somehow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without enough strength, the current of the water flow would’ve forced any person to follow the tide. But for Bai Yunfei, who had enough strength, he could go against the ‘current’ and break free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Bai Yunfei’s previous act, Bai Yunfei was no longer inhibited by the downward current of the liquids in the tunnel. Like a motor going against the tide, Bai Yunfei was traversing upwards from the tunnel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was paranoid that he’d be attacked again as he swam up the tunnels, but after several minutes of doing so, he had yet to be attacked. Aside from the current trying to force him downwards, Bai Yunfei was in no other danger.</span></p>

The water around him was starting to grow lighter in color almost, and the sticky sensation he had been feeling was starting to ebb a bit. It seemed that he was getting closer to the surface.</span></p>

Yunfei! We’re in trouble! We’re….we’re not going anywhere!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Bai Yunfei turned his head towards Xiao Qi, unsure if he had heard correctly. “What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The direction! The direction’s not right—we’re not going up, but….”</span></p>

The area up ahead suddenly brightened up and the space around him seemed to lighten up. The pressure that previously been around him was now completely gone as well. Before he could fully comprehend the changes that was taking place, another sensation was starting to disseminate through his body….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His center of gravity!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Somehow, the changes that was taking place through the earth in the tunnel had done something: it managed to change the direction of gravity!</span></p>

Him reorientating himself by standing ‘upright’ was actually right, since the direction of gravity had changed then. Misguided by this new change in direction, Bai Yunfei traveled in the wrong direction of the tunnel to reach the center of it all without ever once being the wiser to it since he had never experienced such a thing before. Never did Bai Yunfei realize he was facing the wrong direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The direction he thought was ‘up’ was in fact the opposite direction of going down.</span></p>

As surprised as he was, Bai Yunfei forced himself to calm down and held his barrier up. His soulsense was already gathering around the area to warn him for anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sweeping around the place, Bai Yunfei realized that he was inside of a body of water!</span></p>

Behind him was a body of turbid mud like the liquid he started from. Another ten meters behind that was something like an invisible barrier that prevented the mud from flowing over. And across that barrier was a body of pure liquid.</span></p>

Kicking against the water, Bai Yunfei propelled him upwards to evade three of the closest tentacles. Another four tentacles followed before he managed to move out of the way fast enough. Circling around in the small area he was in, Bai Yunfei was able to just barely avoid most of the tentacles. But because he was holding onto the little girl still, Bai Yunfei was unable to attack the tentacles. And because Xiao Qi had never been in an ‘underwater’ battle before, Xiao Qi couldn’t think of what to do to fight.</span></p>
