 <p>Chapter 97: 'Superior' Equipment</p>
 <p>On the afternoon of the second day, Bai Yunfei was strolling around Yanlin City as he pleased.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei could only slowly walk around the surrounding streets to his inn at a very slow pace since Yanlin City was so massive. In any case, he had already planned on staying here for a few more days before moving to another area.</p>
 <p>Within one of the more luxurious looking jewelry stores, Bai Yunfei had been picking out several ‘High-tier’ accessories. But then he realized that he didn’t have much money.</p>
 <p>“Boss, I want to buy some weapons, would it be possible for you to tell me where to go to buy them?” Bai Yunfei dropped a bag of gold coins for the shopkeeper while putting away the accessories he bought into his space ring.</p>
 <p>Taking the gold coins, the shopkeeper displayed a respectful look on his face. Not only was Bai Yunfei a client, he was more importantly a strong soul cultivator. With a nod of his head, the shopkeeper answered deferentially, “Why yes, if we are talking about a top-notch weapons store, then there is the ‘Hundred Armaments’ store not too far away. Master soul cultivator, do you wish to purchase a weapon for yourself? That place will serve you well. It is the store of the number one family in Yanlin City, the house of Jiang. The weapons in there are strong without a doubt, and they sell even soul armaments.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? There’s even soul armaments there?” Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows rose up in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Correct. I’ve heard that the house of Jiang has some connections with the Crafting School. The reason why they have amassed so many soul armaments is because of the Crafting School…”</p>
 <p>“The Crafting School!” Bai Yunfei’s heart trembled as he began to grow even more interested in the store. “That ‘Hundred Armaments’, where is it?”</p>
 <p>“Take a left from here, and then five hundred meters ahead, there’ll be a crossroad…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ten minutes later, Bai Yunfei arrived at the ‘Hundred Armaments’ the shopkeeper had told him about.</p>
 <p>A single two-story building with entrance gates ten meters wide and red roof tiles gave off an imposing manner. It was especially imposing with the signboard ‘Hundred Armaments’ on top of the building with an austere aura as if it had been carved with a sword.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei walked into the store, he realized that the interior of it was far bigger than he had initially thought. The interior was practically several hundred cubic meters large, and rows and rows of racks could be seen with weaponry positioned on them. The chill and gleam from the blades was very noticeable and forbidding.</p>
 <p>Despite such a large store, there were only a scant few people inside browsing the choice of weapons inside. On the side were plenty of uniformed employees. When Bai Yunfei took a glance, he could see that aside from a group of people following a young lord, everyone else were all soul cultivators.</p>
 <p>“My lord, welcome to the Hundred Armaments. What might you need my assistance for?” The moment Bai Yunfei walked into the store, the receptionist had taken notice of him. The receptionist did not feel any contempt when he saw the ordinary clothes Bai Yunfei wore. Instead, the receptionist made quick a judgement that this person was also a decent soul cultivator when he saw how Bai Yunfei had taken a cautionary glance around the place and had an aura that was quite powerful.</p>
 <p>Looking back, Bai Yunfei took a look at the shopkeeper. Although he could not make an accurate judgement, he was at least sure that this one was a Soul Warrior at the very least.</p>
 <p><em>“Is this the power of a major household? If a Soul Warrior is just a small shopkeeper….”</em> Bai Yunfei was shocked for a moment. “I wish to take a look around, is there anything I need to know?”</p>
 <p>“Very well, just please take your time.” The shopkeeper smiled. With a wave to another employee, he had them follow Bai Yunfei should he ever need their assistance.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei walked to the left side of the weapons rack and glanced around before picking up a meter long broadsword.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p><em>“Superior-tier!”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyes sparkled, <em>“The attack is 157….this must be one of those ‘incomplete soul armaments’ that brother Hong Yin spoke about before. The ones that lie in between a regular item and a soul armaments.”</em></p>
 <p>After careful consideration, Bai Yunfei put down the broadsword and picked up another meter long whip sword.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Following another moment of deliberation, Bai Yunfei continued to pick up another black broad axe….</p>
 <p>After a while, Bai Yunfei practically picked up dozens of weapons. Without exception, each one of these items were of the superior-tier.</p>
 <p><em>“How great the house of Jiang is. Of all the minor cities I came across on the way here, ‘High-tier’ was the highest quality any equipment could go. But in this store, practically everything is of the ‘Superior-tier’!”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyes glistened. Pondering, he finally grabbed a dagger and turned to the employee that had respectfully waiting for him by the side, “How much for this dagger?”</p>
 <p>“My lord, every piece of weaponry in the first story of this store is a hundred gold per item.”</p>
 <p>“A hundred!” Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows had nearly rosen into the air in minute shock. <em>“A hundred gold coins is&nbsp;enough to feed an entire family of commoners for an entire lifetime. Are incomplete soul armaments really worth that much?”</em></p>
 <p>He unconsciously rubbed the hand he wore his Space Ring on. In the past, he had exploded plenty of +8 and +9 ‘High-tier’ equipment, but today, who knew just how many were left.</p>
 <p>Then, Bai Yunfei put down the dagger in his hand and returned to the counter.</p>
 <p>When the shopkeeper saw Bai Yunfei return empty-handed, the man asked with confusion, “Yes? Did my lord not find a suitable item?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei approached the counter and asked, “Would your store happen to buy items as well as sell them?”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” The shopkeeper was taken back for a moment before realizing something. Looking at Bai Yunfei, he asked, “Did my lord come to sell a soul armaments? This store primarily sells the weapons from the Crafting School, but there are times where we will accept the items our customers might not be able to use. However, whether or not we purchase these weapons is based on their quality…”</p>
 <p>With a faint smile, Bai Yunfei shook his hand and brought out a +9 ‘High-tier’ dagger, “Would you like to look at this dagger?”</p>
 <p>Taking the dagger into his hands, the shopkeeper began to inspect it before giving a few experimental swipes at a testing rock. Surprised, the shopkeeper turned to Bai Yunfei, “This is an incomplete soul armament with average strength, is my lord adamant on selling this?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, are you willing to buy it?”</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper went silent to think for a moment before smiling, “My lord is quite strong. If you truly wish to sell this item, then that must mean you are currently low on funds. With such a strong soul cultivator like you, this store would be very pleased to become friends with you. How about this, we’ll buy this dagger for ninety gold coins, is that satisfactory?”</p>
 <p>Thinking for a moment, Bai Yunfei asked again, “I have another deal to discuss, would you be willing to hear it?”</p>
 <p>“Oh? If my lord would please continue.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei shook his right hand over the counter, causing fourteen items to fall onto the counter with a clattering sound. More than a half of them were daggers.</p>
 <p>“These are all equipment roughly on par with the incomplete soul armaments. I’ll sell two daggers and exchange the other dozen for the daggers in this store, would that be possible?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s actions, at that moment, had knocked the shopkeeper into a daze. Looking at the dozen weapons on the counter, he had remained in that daze for another few seconds before suddenly waking back up. Taking one of them into his hands to inspect it, the shopkeeper thought for a second before asking, “Is my lord serious? You’ve originally had all these daggers, and yet you still wish to trade them in?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei smiled, “Of course I am serious, or should I start to joke around instead?”</p>
 <p>The eyebrows of the shopkeeper furrowed together as he observed Bai Yunfei before suddenly widening in realization, “To be able to take so many incomplete soul armaments at once… is my lord from the Crafting School?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was surprised, but then with a gleam of his eyes, Bai Yunfei then laughed. Without answering the shopkeeper’s question, he spoke, “What, is this proposal of mine not satisfactory? Perhaps I should not buy the daggers for now.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, no no, my lord’s proposal is something this store can agree to. Allow me to make the arrangements.” The shopkeeper thought that Bai Yunfei did not want to reveal his own identity, so he did not ask any more questions. After instructing the employees to the side, Bai Yunfei was quickly given a bag of gold and ten daggers while the fourteen other daggers were taken away by the employees.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei took a good look at the daggers properties with a satisfied nod before putting the ten daggers and the money into his space ring.</p>
 <p>“My lord, the second floor to this store still has soul armaments for sale. Would you be interested in taking a look? Perhaps you will find a soul armaments that is to your satisfaction. Naturally, the price of a soul armament is far more expensive, but this store will also take other soul armaments, primal stones, or soul crystals as payment…”</p>
