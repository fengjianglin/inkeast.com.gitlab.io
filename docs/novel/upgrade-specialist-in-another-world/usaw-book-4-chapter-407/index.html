 <p>Chapter 407: Blue-eyes Wyrm</p>
 <p>On the eve of the sunset when the world was still dim in light, Bai Yunfei’s eyes flew open without warning.</p>
 <p>Rising slowly to his feet, he looked around the perimeter of the cave, “It’s not even bright out yet, geez….Couldn’t you have waitd two more hours or something? I was having a nice nap….” he grumbled.</p>
 <p>He spoke to no one in particular. Dusting the hay off himself with a sigh, Bai Yunfei slowly walked outside.</p>
 <p>Because Bai Yunfei woke up, Xiao Qi found itself waking up as well. Still groggy, the bird was unsure what Bai Yunfei was doing, but before long, it shook itself once and flew after him.</p>
 <p>The bird reached Bai Yunfei as he stood at the entrance, taking in the sea of trees in front of him with a calm eye. The skies were still abundant with the stars and the moon, but only bright enough to illuminate just a little bit of the trees all around. Where some parts of the forest was sparse in trees, several other forms of plant life could be seen, but aside from that, there wasn’t anything else visible to the naked eye.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei strode out from the cave, he was intentionally looking at a specific part of the forest fifty meters towards the right. In that area, the trees were roughly ten meters high and was quite dense in plant life. Bai Yunfei smiled at the sight, “I know you’re there, stop hiding and come on out!”</p>
 <p>He didn’t yell, but his voice was audible to anyone within three hundred meters of him. But despite that, there was no movement to be seen.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi stared inquisitively at Bai Yunfei as if to try and guess what he was doing.</p>
 <p>“I felt your presence already; you think yourself stronger than me and want to eat me? I know you were paying attention to the fight between the greenwood wolf and the prisma oriole three days ago, were you planning to take a part of the spoils yourself?” Bai Yunfei quipped, as if trying to make conversation with someone. When there was no response to be had, he felt a tinge of boredom in him start to stir, <em>“Is talking to soulbeasts with little rationality really impossible?”</em></p>
 <p>“I told you to stop hiding and come on out!”</p>
 <p>This time, rather than wait silently, Bai Yunfei threw a fireball formed by his Ardent Sun Glove at the spot he was looking at!</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The fireball whizzed through the air and into the spot behind the trees. Exploding when it hit the ground, the fireball soon set anything within a twenty meter radius on fire!</p>
 <p>“Roarr!!!”</p>
 <p>From the blaze, a furious roar exploded outwards following a large burst of soulforce. In a flash of blue light, a gigantic figure dashed out into Bai Yunfei’s eyesight!</p>
 <p>Now the figure was in Bai Yunfei’s line of sight, he could tell just what kind of soulbeast it was. The soulbeast stood about ten meters tall, had a huge head with sharp teeth, and a long neck. Further down its body was two bulky limbs, and at the front of the body was two comparatively shorter limbs. All four of its appendages were equipped with sharp claws, and the glint off the extremities gave Bai Yunfei no doubt that they’d be able to tear through stone and rock without a problem if the soulbeast wanted to. At the very end of its body, a thick tail smashed through a tree thick enough for three adult humans to barely wrap their arms around. (Please imagine a soulbeast similar to a T. Rex)</p>
 <p>A light blue as the ocean rippled across its body, protecting it from the intense flames that assaulted it and quickly extinguishing the fires!</p>
 <p><em>“A water type eh?”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows rose slightly on his face. <em>“An early-stage class six blue-eyes wyrm. That’s a rare one, didn’t think I’d see one here.”</em></p>
 <p>“Roarr!” Again, the blue-eyes wyrm howled, angered by the look of contempt coming from Bai Yunfei. Its aquamarine eyes gave him the death stare as it charged its body up with blue light. As it charged up, all of the elemental water in the surrounding vicinity started to congregate in front of it in the form of a screen of water.</p>
 <p>In the second after it formed, countless of darts made of elemental water started fly at Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>The amount of projectiles coming at him didn’t seem to faze Bai Yunfei. The Violet Soul Ring on his right hand twinkled with light once before the Cataclysmic Seal appeared in a burst of orange light to erect a barrier in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang….”</p>
 <p>A series of water darts slammed into the barrier, but not one made its way through it. The barrier held strong, with only several ripples to be seen on the barrier, but the parts of the cliff wall that wasn’t protected by the barrier was immediately perforated by the darts!</p>
 <p>“You’ve good timing, let me use you to test the Beast Taming Ring!” Eyes glowing with excitement, Bai Yunfei took out the item and fed soulforce into it. When it started to glow with all the colors of the rainbow, and when the attack on him ended, he threw the object towards the blue-eyes wyrm!</p>
 <p>Almost expertly, the ring expanded to two meters in circumference and flew through the air straight and true towards the wyrm’s head!</p>
 <p>“Roar!!”</p>
 <p>It was only natural for the wyrm to react to an object being thrown at it. The blue light surrounding its body flickered briefly as it swung its tail forward. At the very tip of it, a bright blue ‘whip’ extended outwards to smash into the Beast Taming Ring!</p>
 <p>“Pow!!” The ring was struck mid-air, causing Bai Yunfei to narrow his eyes and raise his hand into the air. As if summoned by a mysterious force, the ring flew back to his hand.</p>
 <p><em>“Obviously, a soulbeast wouldn’t let the Beast Taming Ring placed on it without a fight, that’ll be a problem….”</em> Bai Yunfei muttered, <em>“Then I’ll beat it first and then have it wear it!”</em></p>
 <p>“Xiao Qi, go back into the cave.” He spoke to Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>After the bird retreated into the cave, Bai Yunfei turned back to the wyrm. At his command, the Cataclysmic Seal released the fireseed in it and had it enter his chest….</p>
 <p>Dual Flame Arts, ‘Coil’ form activate!!</p>
 <p>In a second, Bai Yunfei’s strength exploded in strength. Despite losing some strength from his mishap with Xiao Qi, Bai Yunfei was still a late-stage Soul Ancestor in strength. After entering the ‘coil’ form, he could force himself to reach the early-stage Soul Exalt level. And overall, he was still strong enough to deal with the blue-eyes wyrm without much difficulty.</p>
 <p>His feet dug into the ground, allowing him to build up enough momentum to fly straight for the wyrm like an arrow shot out from a bow.</p>
 <p>His forward advancement was met with a mighty tail whip from the wyrm. Unphased by the attack, Bai Yunfei clenched his red light emitting right hand and punched out at it!</p>
 <p>Eighty-one Fold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>When fist met tail, Bai Yunfei was whipped to the side, but the wyrm wasn’t left unharmed. Howling in pain, it’s tail was thrusted in the opposite direction of Bai Yunfei with a slight shiver to its frame.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Flipping himself upright in the air, Bai Yunfei’s legs bent at the knees as if preparing himself for impact.</p>
 <p>Then, red light glowed beneath his feet, serving as solid ground for him to step on! Pushing against it, he flew in the opposite direction of his original path to come flying at the wyrm’s head again!</p>
 <p>But having not been paying attention to what the wyrm was doing, Bai Yunfei was surprised to see a giant gaping maw come forward to greet him! Not only did it look like the wyrm was about to eat him, but its jaws were filled with blue light to blast him with a ball of elemental water as well.</p>
 <p>Extending his right arm at the jaws of the soulbeast, the Ardent Sun Glove on Bai Yunfei’s hand exploded with scorching red light and heat to strike at the sphere of elemental water with a burst of elemental fire!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!” The two elements collided with one another, resulting in an explosion near the wyrm’s mouth, sending it backwards due to the blast!!</p>
 <p>“Now’s my chance!!” Granted the prime opportunity to strike, Bai Yunfei tossed the Beast Taming Ring in his left hand towards the right forelimb of the wyrm!</p>
 <p>Flying towards Bai Yunfei’s target in a trail of rainbow light, the Beast Taming Ring flew onto the wyrm’s arm and contracted quickly to latch onto it like a bracelet!</p>
