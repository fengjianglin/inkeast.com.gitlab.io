 <p>Chapter 326: Instant Death? (Fourth)</p>
 <p>Not once did Bai Yunfei ever expect to see the two people in front of him right now.</p>
 <p>It was only a while ago that Bai Yunfei first met the two: the Flying Dagger brothers, Han Chong and Han Lin!</p>
 <p>When no answer was heard, Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed together with a chillingly-cold glare. “What? Are you two trying to take away my fireseed spirit mushroom?!”</p>
 <p>Finally, the two brothers snapped back to awareness. “This is a misunderstanding, brother Bai!” Han Chong brought his hands up to defend himself, “The two of us mean no harm! We were requested for this mission and were only lending assistance!”</p>
 <p>“Young hero, are you reinforcements from Mo City?” The other man wearing an orange robe right next to Han Chong spoke out. “I am Wu Cheng, the one responsible for transporting the fireseed spirit mushroom. The Flying Dagger brothers are the help I requested; the ones who want to steal the fireseed spirit mushroom are those two over there!”</p>
 <p>Rather than to mince words, Wu Cheng explained the situation concisely to Bai Yunfei. His entire face was an unhealthy shade of pale and his left arm was hung uselessly by his side.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Lightening up, Bai Yunfei nodded in response to Wu Gang before turning to the two black-robed people to his right.</p>
 <p>The both of them looked not only to be in the same age-group, but also had the same facial appearances of each other; meaning that they were brothers.</p>
 <p>And from their auras, Bai Yunfei could sense that the one on the right was a mid-stage Soul Ancestor and the other a late-stage Soul Ancestor!</p>
 <p>Both men had dark looks on their faces, and the mid-stage Soul Ancestor had a huge trail of blood dripping down his left arm while the other wasn’t injured in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Han Chong and Han Lin looked to be in a considerably better shape than the other two, as their clothes were tattered and Han Lin had a huge wound on the left side of his hip. Though the blood was clotted, the wound itself was still quite heavy.</p>
 <p>While Bai Yunfei was looking at the two enemies, they themselves were rapidly thinking of their next course of action. Lü Fang (the late-stage Soul Ancestor) eyed Bai Yunfei for a split-second longer before suddenly shouting, “Run!!”</p>
 <p>His feet pushed against the ground as he spoke. Kicking up a large dust storm with his energy-infused feet, the man ran off to where Lü Yuan (The mid-stage Soul Ancestor) was while the dust storm blocked Bai Yunfei’s vision.</p>
 <p>The two brothers clearly noticed that the fight wasn’t in their favor, so it’d be best to flee instead.</p>
 <p>“Trying to run?!” Before Bai Yunfei could even do anything, Han Chong spoke out first. A rush of wind flew out with a swing of his hand, blowing away the dust storm and restoring visibility to their group. At the same time, two green streaks of light shot out from his right hand to chase after the two fleeing persons!</p>
 <p>Hitting the two Lü brothers was easier said than done, however. Though the flying daggers flew fast and true, they only managed to fly past the two.</p>
 <p>Narrowing his eyes, Han Chong snorted lightly before he bent all five fingers and pulled his hand back violently.</p>
 <p>As if responding to his hand gestures, the two flying daggers turned around mid-flight to strike at the two brothers from the front!</p>
 <p>This time, the two men were forced to move perpendicular to their original direction despite having dodged the flying daggers successfully.</p>
 <p>Han Chong and Han Lin glanced at each other to acknowledge the sight in front of them and chased after the two together.</p>
 <p>In Lü Fang’s hand was a single ox-tail sword with chain ringlets on its back side. His brother, Lü Yuan, favored a dagger that glittered red at times, but it looked equally dangerous to his brother’s weapon. Combined with their coordinated teamwork, the Lü brothers were able to gain the upper hand over the Han brothers in a few quick exchanges.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the Han weren’t trying so much to win against the Lü than to make sure that they wouldn’t escape, so the Han brothers made use of diversionary tactics to stall for time.</p>
 <p>“Where is the fireseed spirit mushroom?” Instead of participating in the battle, Bai Yunfei first asked Wu Cheng about the whereabouts of the item.</p>
 <p>“It’s….” Wu Cheng’s face dropped several shades of color as he motioned at his severely injured left arm. “I’m ashamed to say that the space ring it was stored in was….taken by them.</p>
 <p>“They came so fast and killed all the other escorting members so quickly. If not for the Flying Dagger brothers, my life would’ve been forfeit already….”</p>
 <p>It was then that Bai Yunfei noticed the mangled mess that was Wu Cheng’s left hand. The ring finger was bent at a very strange and terrifying angle; clearly, it was broken.</p>
 <p>“Well then….” The urge to kill began to surge in Bai Yunfei’s eyes, “If that’s the case, then killing them won’t be a problem….”</p>
 <p>“Young hero, you’re…” Bai Yunfei’s words were strange to Wu Cheng; he could ‘see’ that Bai Yunfei was only a late-stage Soul Warrior, so Wu Cheng absolutely couldn’t see just how Bai Yunfei would be able to partake in a battle where everyone was a Soul Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his sentence however, Wu Cheng was interrupted by Bai Yunfei’s explosive forward push to enter the fray!</p>
 <p>He had no elemental power to be felt from his body, but the speed at which he was traveling at was astounding. Like an arrow shot from a bow, his feet was practically gliding and his entire body left phantom images behind as he charged straight into the battlefield.</p>
 <p>His right hand shook once to take something out, and with a swing of his hand, a ray of purple light streaked for Lü Yuan on the right side.</p>
 <p>The Lightning Bolt Dagger!!</p>
 <p>The schematics to make two of the more peculiar flying daggers in the manual were simple enough for Bai Yunfei to craft back in the Crafting School. One of the ones he made was the Lightning Bolt Dagger, but he wasn’t sure how to use it yet. Back when he exchanged the part of the manual with Han Chong, Bai Yunfei learned how to throw the Lightning Bolt Dagger.</p>
 <p>But right now, he was fully capable of making use of the daggers at a level of familiarity equal to that of Han Chong and Han Lin!</p>
 <p>There was an advantage Bai Yunfei had over the Han brothers. His flying dagger was crafted and made far superior to theirs since it was….upgraded!</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Due to the high requirements and specialized design of it, the grade of the Lightning Bolt Dagger wasn’t too high. But after it reached +10, the attack of the dagger was comparable to a low-earth tier soul armament.</p>
 <p>The flying dagger was the first to reach Lü Yuan. Barely managing to block the flying dagger with his dagger, Lü Yuan’s eyes filled up with anger as he glared at Bai Yunfei. Turning around to get away from Han Lin, Lü Yuan began to gather a large amount of elemental fire in his dagger before stabbing out at Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>A blade of fire about a meter long shot out from his dagger towards Bai Yunfei with a speed that was strangely going at the same speed as Bai Yunfei’s Lightning Bolt Dagger!!</p>
 <p>The brilliance that was his counter attack had Lü Yuan in complete confidence that he’d win. Should even an early-stage Soul Ancestor fight him here, this attack of his would still be very hard for them to endure!</p>
 <p>But Bai Yunfei had no intentions of dodging from this attack.</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal came into being with a shake of his right hand, and in the next second, its defensive effect materialized a barrier over Bai Yunfei’s body.</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>The fire struck the barrier, but Bai Yunfei wasn’t harmed in the slightest. Not even his forward speeds was impacted in the least, and so soon enough, he was right in front of Lü Yuan!</p>
 <p>His right hand stretched out with a brilliant blaze of fire as the Fire-tipped Spear appeared. Stabbing forward with the weapon, the spear blew up elemental fire!</p>
 <p>Threefold Stab!!</p>
 <p>The pupils in Lü Yuan’s eyes contracted in fear as he tried to comprehend just how Bai Yunfei was able to defend himself from the attack. It proved to be a bad time to be thinking such thoughts, however, as the Fire-tipped Spear was already on the verge of stabbing through his chest.</p>
 <p>Having no time to dodge left nor right, all Lü Yuan could do was grit his teeth and slam his feet against the ground to propel himself backwards while bringing his dagger up to defend himself.</p>
 <p>“Clank!!”</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear stabbed into the dagger, but in the next second...</p>
 <p>“Booom!!!!”</p>
 <p>The +10 Additional Effect of the Fire-tipped Spear had activated!!</p>
