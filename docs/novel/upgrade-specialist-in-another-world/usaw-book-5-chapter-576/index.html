 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Your soul.”</span></p>

There weren’t even many people that knew it was Bai Yunfei that was injured. And yet Dan Teng had clearly found out about it today. He was capable of seeing the state Bai Yunfei’s soul was in<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>this wasn’t something normal people could do.</span></p>

He only had a small sliver of his soul that required healing, so it wasn’t surprising that Bai Yunfei had such a reaction to Dan Teng’s discovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dan Teng smiled. “Haha, don’t be so surprised, Yunfei. As a person who spent many years studying all sorts of tea and its uses towards the soul, I would definitely be one of those people that are particular sensitive to the souls of others. You might look fine on the outside, but I can definitely sense the faint damages done to yours. The lingering effects of a strong attack, was it? Your soul was damaged from it?! You were fine when I last saw you at the casino, did you….get into trouble later that night? And the state of your soul, did you fight with a Soul King? I’ve noticed something peculiar with how your soul was damaged, did you...fight against a darkness-type soul cultivator?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; “……”</span></p>

He had only looked at Bai Yunfei for a moment, and yet he was able to divine so many things from that moment, how amazing was that?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Yunfei didn’t respond, Dan Teng looked apologetic. “Haha, I spoke too much. Yunfei, if you don’t want to say it, then don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah...that’s not it.” Bai Yunfei hurried to correct&nbsp;the situation. “I was only just surprised with how accurate you were, uncle Dan. Indeed, I was attacked by a Soul King a while ago and had my soul damaged as a result. I might’ve healed for the most part, but there’s still a few annoying side-effects. Most recently, I….have found it hard to control my emotions. It’s causing me a decent amount of trouble….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Is that right?” Dan Teng rubbed his chin at Bai Yunfei’s story. “Losing control over your emotions when you had your soul damaged? As far as side effects go, yours is rather light….Haha, Yunfei, you came to the right place. I can guarantee you that in twenty days or so, I’ll fix up that problem for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Bai Yunfei exclaimed. “Is that true, uncle Dan?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In many other areas, I’d never give my word, but when it comes to the soul….I’ve confidence in my words. My Soothing Heart Teahouse is meant exactly for these type of situations. Your injury isn’t too serious, as long as you drink the Soul Consolidating Tea every day, you’ll be able to get rid of those annoying side-effects within twenty days or so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Bai Yunfei felt himself grow hopeful, “That’s….that’s amazing, uncle Dan. This would really help me out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you’re being too polite, Yunfei. It’s nothing much. You’ll have to come everyday and drink a pot of the Soul Consolidating Tea for it to work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Every day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. It’s best that you come twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. You can’t repair damages done to the heart so sloppily unless you want to risk a relapse and have the damage get even worse. The chances of that are low, but it’s always best to take things cautiously. The sooner you recover, the more you won’t have to worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I….” Bai Yunfei hesitated for a while before committing to his answer. “Alright! I’ll listen to you then, uncle Dan. I hope that my recovery will be a swift one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dan Teng was saying his wound wasn’t very serious, but Bai Yunfei knew it wasn’t as easy as he said it’d be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the time was practically nothing, the price on the other hand….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dan Teng said that Bai Yunfei would need to come in for around twenty days and order a ‘Soul Consolidating Tea’, one which that costed about one high-grade primal stone per pot!! By doing some quick maths, Bai Yunfei was able to calculate the costs….twice a day for twenty days meant forty high-grade primal stones! Just how many people could afford a price like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then again, such a price wasn’t too much of a problem. He had won twenty high-grade primal stones back in Casino Jin after all. If he really needed the money, he’d sell some of his less important heaven-tier soul armaments….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter the case, Bai Yunfei really didn’t like this problem he was having with the side-effects of his soul being damaged. It was a problem that’d only blow up in his face if he ignored it, so it was best that he get rid of this problem as soon as possible, and the prices in doing so would be well worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dan Teng continued onwards to say, “As for the price of the Soul Consolidating Tea….well, I wouldn’t be able to make a living if I let you drink them all for free, haha. I don’t have much of it, and it’s hard to restock them, but I’ll give you a discount. Let’s say fifty percent off. Surely that’ll be enough to convince you I’m no miser.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was astonished by his generosity. “A miser? How could you be one? Uncle Teng….you are far too generous, I cannot thank you enough….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was that not the truth? A fifty percent discount meant only needing to pay twenty high-grade primal stones. Bai Yunfei and Dan Teng didn’t even have that close of a relationship with one another, so the fact that Dan Teng was willing to provide such an extensive discount for Bai Yunfei was mind boggling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The doors to their room opened up, revealing the young man attending to the store from earlier. In his hand was a tray with a teapot and three tea cups on it. Setting the teapot and tea cups in front of the three, the young man was then dismissed to return back down to the first floor to watch over it again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dan Teng lifted the teapot to pour some of the tea inside into the tea cups of Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai. “This pot here is the best pot of Soul Consolidating Tea I have, please take a sip and see how you like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He poured tea into the tea cups until it was seventy percent full before stopping. Gesturing at the cups, Dan Teng had Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai take their cups into their hands. Carefully, Bai Yunfei brought the tea cup up closer to his face to look at it. The only thing he saw was what appeared to be normal boiled water. If he wasn’t told beforehand, Bai Yunfei would’ve assumed it was only just water with how transparent it was. But when he raised it up to drink, the distinct aroma of tea could be smelt, and Bai Yunfei could confirm then that this tea was anything but normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei would be the first to admit he hadn’t his fair share of expensive teas. But when he took a sip of this one, Bai Yunfei would also not be afraid to admit that any tea he had drunk before felt like they had been brewed by the tree leaves of a random tree. This one cup of tea he had now was delicious. At a sip, he could feel himself transported to a different world where peach blossom trees could be had, and a gentle wind was blowing softly onto his face. The distinct sound of a spring could be had, and Bai Yunfei could even feel the soft warm rays of sunshine pelter his face in the signs of spring….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei woke the next second, his eyes blinking when he realized what he just felt had only been an illusion of his own mind’s creation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt spellbound!! It was as if he had been stuck in an illusion where all of his worries had been turned into nothing. Even his usual level of vigilance had been reduced to nothing!!</span></p>

How special this ‘Soul Consolidating Tea’ was!</span></p>

He wasn’t having any strange feelings from it now, but his eyes remained fixated on it. Blowing several times again onto the surface of the tea, Bai Yunfei took yet another sip so that half of the cup was drained into his throat.</span></p>

But then along the way as it left behind a refreshing sensation, it….disappeared!</span></p>

As the tea traveled down his throat and left behind a refreshing aftertaste, Bai Yunfei felt the tea start to evaporate inside his body!</span></p>

It was as if his entire body was being dunked into a hot spring of water and was basking him in a flow of utmost comfort. But more importantly, the feelings of vexation he had on his mind from earlier thoughts had been like a layer of fog coming into contact with a fierce burst of sun to scatter apart!</span></p>

A strange wave of energy mixed with the tea to circulate around his body. With each circulation, Bai Yunfei felt his mind grow clearer, and the ‘sliver’ missing from his soul was starting to regenerate!</span></p>
