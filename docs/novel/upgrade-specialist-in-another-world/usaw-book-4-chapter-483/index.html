 <p>Chapter 483: New Equipment and New 'Attribute'</p>
 <p>Surely, there’d be no danger to be had in the class three area. Since he was on the verge of returning to the Tianhun Empire, Bai Yunfei figured his future travels would be a lot ‘safer’ than the Soulbeast Forest was. Now was a good time to make himself another soul armament and increase his strength.</p>
 <p>Giving the idea a lot more thought, bai Yunfei finally decided.</p>
 <p>He waved his hand, bringing out the lightning fire cauldron with a plop.</p>
 <p>The seismic waves from the cauldron falling to the ground jostled Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan. Giving them a warning, Bai Yunfei said, “Xiao Qi, Xiao Lan, I’ll be crafting now. Stand guard at the entrance and don’t disturb me.”</p>
 <p>The two soulbeasts nodded. Standing guard over the cave wouldn’t be a problem for them.</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal popped out from the Violet Soul Ring and spat out the fireseed within it. Entering the cauldron, the fireseed raised the temperature of the flames in it.</p>
 <p>Carefully, Bai Yunfei thought about what materials would go best with the illusion soulgem. One by one, he took them out, and then a white stone three times bigger than his fist.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong><strong>Equipment Grade: High Earth <br>Elemental Affinity: None <br>Equipment Effect 1: Allow the successful upgrade of any equipment +10 and under once.</strong><br>Equipment Effect 2: Increase the tier of an equipment when crafting by one (High Earth tier being the highest).&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Cannot be upgraded</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>This was a +10 Upgrade Stone. Its usages in terms of upgrading wasn’t substantial, but its second equipment effect was quite useful when crafting.</p>
 <p>He gained eight +10 Upgrade Stones from the Nephrite Throne and used three already. With him using another one today, that meant he’d have only four left. Aside from that, he used a +11 Upgrade Stone as well.</p>
 <p>In total, Bai Yunfei had these four +10 Upgrade Stones, two +11 Upgrade Stones, and a +12 Upgrade Stone.</p>
 <p>That +11 Upgrade Stone had been used to upgrade the Luck Pendant, since he figured ‘luck’ was a mysterious, yet miraculous thing. It had plenty of benefits, and Bai Yunfei had faith it’d help him.</p>
 <p>And after he upgraded it, Bai Yunfei found out that the pendant increased the probability of his effects activating by a decent amount. Furthermore, Bai Yunfei came across plenty of great treasures and such in his one year of travel, all of which he attributed to ‘luck’.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei felt tempted to use the +12 Upgrade Stone. He wanted to see what it was like, and what it would do, but he managed to stave off that temptation in the end.</p>
 <p>He only had one of those, so it’d do him well not to waste it.</p>
 <p>Crafting a mid-earth tier soul armament wasn’t a problem for him with his strength. Combined with the upgrade stone, it seemed possible to craft even a high-earth tier soul armament. Crafting an accessory would be hard as well, but Bai Yunfei could guarantee it being a mid-earth tier at the very least.</p>
 <p>Yes.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was going for another accessory to craft.</p>
 <p>Both his hands had rings already, and rings were already in surplus. He couldn’t swap off the Luck Pendant, and neither did Bai Yunfei want an earring.</p>
 <p>So that meant he’d craft a bracelet.</p>
 <p>Decided, Bai Yunfei focused onto the cauldron. The upgrade stone in his hand turned into white powder to be sucked into the soulgem, which was then deposited into the cauldron along with the other materials.</p>
 <p>The crafting process was an arduous one (and this author is sure no one is interested in the details), fire and sparks filled the cave as Bai Yunfei focused on his craft…..</p>
 <p>He didn’t dare be sloppy. What he was using was the illusion soulgem, so every single step had to be taken with great caution to ensure a high quality end product.</p>
 <p>Outside the cave, the night was replaced by day, and then day replaced by night once again….</p>
 <p>It took Bai Yunfei two whole days and three nights to craft!!</p>
 <p>In the end, Bai Yunfei finally finished crafting near the dawn of the third day. The cauldron lit up gloriously with a light that illuminated the entire cave. It died away back into the cauldron, leaving behind a pink light that casted a hallucogenic atmosphere in the cave.</p>
 <p>Forehead slick with sweat, Bai Yunfei sighed in relief. He was tired, but also excited. Waving his right hand, he watched as the item within the cauldron flew out.</p>
 <p>The object flew out from the cauldron and into Bai Yunfei’s right hand, shining with light as it did. When the light died away, a plain bracelet was left in his palm.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the bracelet was transparent in color, like a clear crystal.</p>
 <p>Uncaring for the physical appearance of the bracelet, however, Bai Yunfei picked it up to inspect its stats.</p>

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes sparkled joyfully, “Haha!! It worked! A high-earth tier soul armament that resists illusions! And 8% soul compatibility already! Wahaha! My ability to craft accessories has improved a lot!!”</p>
 <p>His excitement had been so uncharacteristic of him that Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan looked up in surprise, had he gone insane from crafting?</p>
 <p>But Bai Yunfei didn’t say anything like ‘I am the strongest in the world!!’. Instead, he was looking at the bracelet so lovingly that Xiao Qi felt a sudden chill.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, gain resistance to illusions….it’s a little more specific than just saying mind-based attacks, so that means it won’t work against those. But having it work against illusions is still stupendous! Not bad at all….” He nodded happily.</p>
 <p>“And now comes the important part….”</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>

 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was floored. With just one upgrade, he discovered yet another never-before-seen attribute!</p>
 <p>“Cha<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>charm?!” He stammered. “You can improve an attribute like that too?!”</p>
 <p>First was ‘luck’, and now came ‘charm’. What else would be next? Wasn’t this getting a little ridiculous? What could the two of those do if put together?</p>
 <p>As confused as he was, Bai Yunfei knew he had to continue upgrading.</p>
 <p>A while later…..</p>
