 <p>Chapter 134: Like A Hot Knife Through Butter</p>
 <p>Wu Sen finally understood what had happened — he had been tricked.</p>
 <p>He had actually been tricked by a member of the younger generation that was holding a high&nbsp;quality soul armament! Furthermore, he had also let the mission’s target escape because of this!</p>
 <p>A burst of anger instantly filled Wu Sen’s mind. He didn’t even bother to think of how a youth like him could possess the strength of a mid-stage Soul Sprite, or whether a person like him that owned a high quality soul armament would have an extraordinary background or not. He only had one thought in his mind — dismember this person who had ruined his plans into a thousand pieces.</p>
 <p><em>“Dammit! I was…”</em></p>
 <p>Wu Sen raised his right hand, preparing to command the Thunderbird to attack while commanding everyone else to slaughter Bai Yunfei. However, halfway through his words, before the others even knew whether he wanted them to run or to fight, the opposing Bai Yunfei took the initiative to make the first move.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei flicked his right wrist, throwing a dagger towards Wu Sen’s face. At the same time, he pushed off the ground with his feet and charged directly towards Wu Lin who was on Wu Sen’s right.</p>
 <p>Wu Sen’s eyes flickered as he waved his right hand forwards, accurately catching the dagger that was aimed at him. Following that, his eyes went wide, and he let out a slightly astonished cry,</p>
 <p>“A soul armament!”</p>
 <p>The attack power of a +9 dagger had already entered the extent of what a soul armament was capable of.</p>
 <p>After looking up, he saw that Bai Yunfei had shot out another three daggers while charging towards Wu Lin. From the undulations of soulforce on those daggers, he could even tell they were also soul armament——even though they were the lowest type of soul armaments, a mere low grade human-ranked armament.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s surprise attack caused Wu Lin to be at a loss for an instant. He had also thought that Bai Yunfei was an expert of the Soul Ancestor realm, so when Bai Yunfei made his move, he had been ‘happy’ to discover that that his enemy was only a mid-stage Soul Sprite instead. Even so, he didn’t dare to neglect the three daggers that were already front of him. Thus, he exerted his soulforce to evade the daggers by ducking downwards. At the same time, the Spirit Monkey let out a screech as it blocked a dagger that Wu Lin was unable to completely dodge. Then, it completely ignored the bone-deep wound on its right arm that was caused by the dagger as it charged towards Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had remained calm as he looked at the roaring black monkey that was charging towards him. He didn’t dodge it. Instead, he passed the Fire-tipped Spear to his left hand and drew back his right hand to his waist. After that, he suddenly struck out at the claw surrounded by orange energy.</p>
 <p>Ninefold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s figure paused momentarily while the black monkey staggered backwards repeatedly. Due to the angle of Bai Yunfei’s fist, its staggering leaned off to the side and exposed Wu Lin, who was behind the monkey and was retreating frantically as well.</p>
 <p>Except for a few special individuals, the soul cultivators of the Beast Taming Sect had to keep their distance while fighting. After all, their specialty was controlling soulbeasts, while their personal strength was relatively low. If they were drawn into a close combat fight, they simply would not be a match against soul cultivators of the same stage.</p>
 <p>His feet continuously moving, Bai Yunfei brushed past the black monkey as he dashed forward. At the same time, he swung his right hand, causing three cold rays of light to shoot out.</p>
 <p><em>“Even more soul armaments!”</em></p>
 <p>Wu Lin’s twitched as he looked at Bai Yunfei, who had already thrown out seven soul armaments as if they were as worthless as cabbage. However, when he saw his brother in a difficult situation, he didn’t have the chance to ponder on it. He pointed his right hand at Bai Yunfei, and the thunderbird that was hovering above his head spread its wings and swooped towards Bai Yunfei like a bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>Wu Lin was stunned as he saw Bai Yunfei easily force back the black monkey. Wu Lin’s was even further shocked when he then saw three more daggers flying towards him, with Bai Yunfei following close behind, not slowing down in the slightest.. He only calmed down slightly as he saw the thunderbird that was rapidly charging towards Bai Yunfei. He poured his soulforce into his legs and stamped on the ground with his right leg, allowing him to change his direction of escape. Thus, he was able to barely dodge the daggers that were flying towards him.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashed as he felt the gale behind him. However, he still didn’t try to evade it. Instead, he slightly bent down and lowered his head. The enormous claws of the thunderbird, that were flickering with a purple light, ferociously scratched his back, but only managed to cause some sparks to fly out. His clothes were torn apart, revealing the Goldsilk Soul Armor underneath. Despite blocking the thunderbird’s attack, long tears had appeared on the Goldsilk Soul Armor, an armamentthat was equivalent to a mid-human tier soul armament! The tears were so deep that they had almost gone completely through the armor!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei felt his heart skip a beat. <em>"</em><em>That was close!"</em> He instantly dispersed the faint numbing sensation caused by the attack. The gaze in his eyes grew colder, but he didn't even spare a glance towards the midair thunderbird or the black monkey that was pursuing him. His gaze remained fixed on the retreating Wu Lin.</p>
 <p>The speed of his approach suddenly increased, which was caused by the activation of an additional effect from a piece of jewelry that he wore. Bai Yunfei swung his right hand, and another two daggers flew towards Wu Lin, who was several tens of metres away from him.</p>
 <p>Wu Lin almost went berserk<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—J</span>ust how many soul armaments can you keep throwing?!?</p>
 <p>As he clenched his teeth, Wu Lin twisted his body again to dodge the two daggers. However, his legs were already somewhat sluggish. This was a sign of overexertion.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashed, and his right hand swung out with an even greater speed. This time, it wasn’t multiple icy lights that shot out, just one. Furthermore, it was blue colored.</p>
 <p>Glacial Pricker!</p>
 <p>Wu Lin’s pupils contracted. He was unable to dodge this attack, and he simply didn’t have the time to. A berserk look appeared in his eyes as an orange light suddenly surged through his body, which gathered on his heart. In that instant, he was even grateful that Bai Yunfei had aimed at his heart<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>Because he had a Heart Protecting Mirror, which was a soul armament that barely qualified as a mid-human tier soul armament.</p>
 <p>“Ding!”</p>
 <p>A weak but clear ringing sound echoed out as Wu Lin’s figure slowed down momentarily. Then, he continued to frantically retreat. The Glacial Pricker hadn’t even pierced through two inches of flesh, and it looked like it hadn’t struck the center of his heart!</p>
 <p>“Brother!”</p>
 <p>Wu Sen’s eyes widened after seeing that his brother was struck in the heart, a berserk expression appeared on his face as he let out a roar filled with anger, causing a purple light to surge through his entire body. The thunderbird let out a sharp whistle and ‘spat’ out a bolt of purple lightning which directly struck Bai Yunfei. Wu Lin had shot forth as well, unexpectedly charging towards Bai Yunfei as well.</p>
 <p>Violet lightning crashed downwards while the thunderbird followed closely behind in pursuit. The black monkey behind him started to close in, attacking with its sharp claws. And just a short distance away from him, an enraged late-stage Soul Sprite was charging towards him..</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes slightly flashed, but his gaze was still fixed on Wu Lin. The Fire-tipped Spear had already returned to his right hand, while the Compliant Rope was instantly flung out by his left. It extended over thirty metres under Wu Lin’s astonished gaze, and it wrapped around his neck in the blink of an eye!</p>
 <p>“Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei coldly snorted as he suddenly stamped his feet. At the same time, he forcefully pulled the Compliant Rope with his left hand while exerting his soulforce to it, causing it to rapidly shorten.</p>
 <p>The lightning struck him, causing Bai Yunfei to be split into two. Following that, the monkey’s claw split his waist open. Then, the claws of the thunderbird tore him into pieces<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>However, that was only an afterimage!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei rushed forth with an unprecedented speed as he activated the full power of the Wave Treading Steps, boosted by the shockwaves from the dual attacks that had been launched behind him. In almost the same instant that the afterimage behind him vanished, he was already less than ten meters away from the pale-faced and panicked Wu Lin!</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Wu Sen let out a roar of despair that even contained some pleading within it, but Bai Yunfei didn’t stop. A killing intent flickered through his eyes, and a red light was released from the Fire-tipped Spear. He raised his right arm, and the spear pierced out!</p>
 <p>“Pcht!”</p>
 <p>Whether it was by accident or on purpose, the spear had once more penetrated towards the heart right next to the Glacial Pricker. Only, this time, the Heart Protecting Mirror wasn’t of any use at all, and the the tip of the spear stabbed through Wu Lin’s chest and out through his back.</p>
 <p>A single thrust to stab the heart!</p>
