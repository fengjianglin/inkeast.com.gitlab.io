<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xiangtian was already panicking before the Beast Taming Ring clamped onto his throat. His hands flew up to his neck the moment he ‘returned’ to grab at the Beast Taming Ring, but he was a moment too late. It was already fitted tightly around his neck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And for the second time in the last five seconds, he froze!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did it!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei smiled wide with glee—he didn’t think his ‘plan’ would work&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes…his plan was to take hold of the Demon-eyed Tiger King!! He had this planned ever since Wu Dijian told him about beast tamers and their mediums. Bai Yunfei knew if he stayed here in the Qimang Mountains and his plan worked, then they’d be able to get a new ‘helper’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Xiao Qi wasn’t able to find Bai Yunfei through their bond was because of the Soul Sealing Mandate sealing his soul. The same reason went for the life slip the Crafting School had of Bai Yunfei since the life slip worked on the principle on sensing the owner’s soul and aura. The slip registered nothing since it could only sense that Bai Yunfei’s soul was no longer ‘in’ the world and so the Crafting School had no choice but to think Bai Yunfei was ‘dead’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Yunfei fully recovered from the effects of the Soul Sealing Mandate, the bond between him and Xiao Qi was reestablished. And he could tell from the bond that Xiao Qi wasn’t that far away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How far that distance was was unknown to Bai Yunfei, but he could already tell Xiao Qi was flying on over. Thus, Bai Yunfei knew it wouldn’t be long before Xiao Qi found him. He also knew from Wu Dijian that Long Lan, Tang Xinyun, and Xiao Bai were all traveling with Xiao Qi. And if they were there, then that meant another important item was with them…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ‘bane of the Beast Taming School’, the Beast Taming Ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way Bai Yunfei would risk using it in a battle against two Soul Emperor. But if one of them was a soulbeast, then things were different…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei made sure Wu Dijian told him everything he knew about the enemies, and the Demon-eyed Tiger King was just one of the topics he touched on. In his mind, Bai Yunfei was sure he was ready for anything that might happen in this battle and was fully prepared to use any equipment that might be useful…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plan was rather simple: Trap Nether first and then capture the Demon-eyed Tiger King with the Beast Taming Ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that was the reason why he had been so focused on Nether at the very beginning. The sole reason why he was so stuck on using the Soul Anchor Technique so many times was so he could wrestle some spare time to deal with the Demon-eyed Tiger King alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The King Caging Bell was a soul armament meant to capture Soul Kings and below, not Soul Emperor. Using it here meant there was a good chance the King Caging Bell might be destroyed, but Bai Yunfei decided it was worth the risk. He even considered using the Soul Sealing Mandate, but he figured Lin Xiangtian might’ve moved differently even if he succeeded in sealing Nether with it. Having Lin Xiangtian in a different dimension for two seconds was also a risk Bai Yunfei wasn’t very sure if it’d pay out well or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thankfully, the Demon-eyed Tiger King didn’t use a soul or elemental attack. It opted to use close quarters combat instead!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And so Bai Yunfei was overjoyed. This way he’d be able to enact his plan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the Core Stone on the Demon-eyed Tiger King gave Bai Yunfei the two seconds he desperately needed to accomplish his plan! And it worked! Everything he was hoping for in his plans had gone off without a hitch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Qi!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei cried out the moment the Beast Taming Ring activated. Gathering his soulforce and mental energy to him, Bai Yunfei dove deep into the mindspace of the Demon-eyed Tiger King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chirp!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Bai Yunfei, Xiao Qi began to do the very same. Gathering the energy of a late-stage class seven soulbeast, the bird attacked at the Demon-eyed Tiger King’s mindspace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahhh!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrified, the Demon-eyed Tiger King clutched his head with both hands and began to scream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a good attempt, but ultimately useless against Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi were both experienced with the Beast Taming Ring. Further strengthened by the bond they shared, the two attacked the mindspace of the Demon-eyed Tiger King full force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast Taming Ring operated by pitting the soulbeast’s mind against Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi ordinarily. But since it was Lin Xiangtian who was controlling the Demon-eyed Tiger King, this became a competition between the willpowers of the three. And neither Bai Yunfei nor Xiao Qi had any reservations in going all out against Lin Xiangtian! This would be an all-out battle to cut Lin Xiangtian down at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another detail about the Beast Taming Ring was that a soulbeast had to ‘resist’. Since the Demon-eyed Tiger King was being manipulated by another and had their instincts suppressed, there was no inherent resistance to the Beast Taming Ring on the soulbeast’s behalf. In a sense, it could be said Bai Yunfei had already successful control over the ‘Demon-eyed Tiger King’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only issue was the fact that the Demon-eyed Tiger King was being controlled by an outsider. They had to worry about Lin Xiangtian’s willpower inside the Demon-eyed Tiger King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So the plan was to force back Lin Xiangtian’s soul, drive out his willpower, and then…eliminate it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mindspace of the Demon-eyed Tiger King was a battlefield between Bai Yunfei, Xiao Qi, and Lin Xiangtian. But Lin Xiangtian didn’t stand a chance with Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi working together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And it was time to drive that point home!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xiangtian launched his counterattack as quickly as he could, but Bai Yunfei beat him to the punch. Swinging his right hand, he threw a white ball of light towards the Demon-eyed Tiger King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seal!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul Sealing Mandate shined with a brilliant light and covered the Demon-eyed Tiger King from head to toe within it! Straight away, the Demon-eyed Tiger King came to an abrupt stop as the Soul Sealing Mandate started to sap away the ability to resist and move!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Lin Xiangtian was horrified to see that the Soul Sealing Mandate even succeeded in forcing him from resisting Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi’s attack in the Demon-eyed Tiger King’s mindspace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was possible for Bai Yunfei to store the Demon-eyed Tiger King in the Core World if he wanted, but that was of course not what Bai Yunfei planned on doing. Together with Xiao Qi, they struck again at the last strand of willpower coming from Lin Xiangtian!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerless to resist like a fish on the chopping block, Lin Xiangtian could only watch in horror as his control over the Demon-eyed Tiger King slowly drained away. Bit by bit, he soon only had a small amount of his soul left in the ‘corner’ of the Demon-eyed Tiger King’s mindspace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the outside, the light shining from the Beast Taming Ring grew even brighter alongside the Demon-eyed Tiger King. The humanistic gleam of light in the Demon-eyed Tiger King’s eyes was gradually disappearing. Lin Xiangtian was losing control of the Demon-eyed Tiger King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gong…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A muffled blast erupted from the interior of the King Caging Bell. Bai Yunfei’s eyes grew wide—he was running out of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gonggg!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another explosion! This time, the King Caging Bell was starting to groan under the pressure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a third knock onto the King Caging Bell before the soul armament could hold back Nether no longer and shot back up into the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A surge of black light flowed out into the world the moment the bell flew away. Nether was back and fully ready to take part in this battle again!</span></p>
