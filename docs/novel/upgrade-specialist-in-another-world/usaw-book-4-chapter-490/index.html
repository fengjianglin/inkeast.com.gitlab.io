 <p>Chapter 490: Poison!!</p>
 <p>The danger Xing Luo was in was overwhelming his mind. All the pressure he was feeling had inhibited his thinking capabilities, and because of that pressure, he didn’t think about the potential consequences when he attacked.</p>
 <p>It was the only thing he could do. Because if he didn’t do anything else, he would die….</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for him, going down this path was only a futile attempt to prolong the inevitable….</p>
 <p>An attempt to kill Bai Yunfei with what mediocre strength he had was a fool’s dream, even with how close he was.</p>
 <p>Though Bai Yunfei was looking at the blue-eyes wyrm, the moment Xing Luo twitched, Bai Yunfei was already moving reflexively with his right arm coming up!</p>
 <p>“Clang!”</p>
 <p>The dagger stabbed into Bai Yunfei’s Ardent Sun Glove, but not through it. Now completely harmless, the dagger was taken into Bai Yunfei’s hand and thrown back at its owner!</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Xing Luo’s realization where the dagger was going to came a little too late. Bai Yunfei had deflected the dagger so that it’d cut into his left shoulder as it flew away!</p>
 <p>The cut wasn’t big at all; just large enough to draw blood. To a soul cultivator, a wound like this could easily be staunched and healed.</p>
 <p>But Xing Luo’s reaction gave Bai Yunfei some alarm.</p>
 <p>He had screamed, staring at the wound on his left shoulder in absolute terror. For such a tiny little wound, his face had the look of despair on it!</p>
 <p>Despair not from his imminent death by Bai Yunfei, but from the tiny cut mark!</p>
 <p>“Ah! Ahhh!!!” He screamed again, his voice reaching a hysterical fervor. Clutching at his left shoulder with his right arm, he tore away the chunk of flesh where the cut mark was!</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to die! I don’t want to dieeee!! Save me!! Save meee!!” Even after tearing away a part of his shoulder, Xing Luo was still howling furiously in tears. “Xu Shen, save me! Save me, father! I don’t want to dieeee!!!”</p>
 <p>“Ahhh!!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t know what to think. Xing Luo’s reaction scared him fiercely, and he didn’t understand what was going on. He looked to the left shoulder of Xing Luo and focused in on it, realizing something.</p>
 <p>“Is this….poison?!”</p>
 <p>Xing Luo tore out enough of his flesh to reveal the pale-white humerus. Aside from the blood and flesh around the afflicted area, Bai Yunfei saw a hint of something else! Some parts of the blood was a darkly purple, and the strong scent of decay was already starting to mature….</p>
 <p>Poison!</p>
 <p>The dagger Xing Luo tried on Bai Yunfei had contained poisoned on its blade!</p>
 <p>And what a fearsome poison this was, if even an early-stage Soul Ancestor wasn’t able to stop it!</p>
 <p>A sliver of fear shot up Bai Yunfei’s spine. If that dagger had hit him, how would he fare with it?</p>
 <p>“I don’t….want to die….sa-save me….”</p>
 <p>Xing Luo’s face grew progressively darker with the same color of the poison, his face twisted in on itself with pain as the poison in him disseminated through his body and to his organs. He looked quite terrible.</p>
 <p>The poison must’ve affected his vocal chords as well, as he was no longer screaming when he pleaded for Bai Yunfei to save him.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>But Bai Yunfei refused. He had no pity for a man who just tried to kill him. And with Xing Luo being killed by his own sinister weapon, that worked just fine for Bai Yunfei. It’d save him the trouble of doing the deed himself.</p>
 <p>“Sa-save…”</p>
 <p>Xing Luo’s words were barely coherent now. His eyes were dimming, and his face was now entirely a dark purple. He laid on the ground, his body twitching as blood dripped from the several orifices on his face.</p>
 <p>Five minutes later, Xing Luo finally succumbed to the poison!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei hadn’t moved from his spot as Xing Luo wasted away under him. When Xing Luo breathed his last, Bai Yunfei snorted. He casted a fireball onto the corpse, burning it away so that only ashes remained.</p>
 <p>With another wave, he collected the nearby dagger and Xing Luo’s space ring for future purposes.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei turned around to walk towards the wind prison a few steps away.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi chirped once in salute to Bai Yunfei before dispelling the tornado and revealing a very frightened Xu Shen inside of it.</p>
 <p>Having been rendered a prisoner in this tornado, Xu Shen had been forced to use his soulsense in order to watch what was happening on the outside. He felt it all; Wu Ming dying to the blue-eyes wyrm, and then Xing Luo’s slow and agonizing death to his own poisoned weapon!</p>
 <p>Xu Shen trembled as Bai Yunfei made his way towards him. Him being a late-stage Soul Ancestor meant nothing in this one moment as he laid paralyzed with terror on the ground.</p>
 <p>Three men came forward to kill Bai Yunfei, and two of them were dead already. It still remained to be seen if he’d be a survivor, though the chances of that wasn’t looking good….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei eyed Xu Shen, a hint of murderous intent in them.</p>
 <p>A lenient hand was taboo when resolving a matter of grudges between soul cultivators. Bai Yunfei was no evildoer, but if someone was coming after his life, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill.</p>
 <p>“Do<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>don’t kill me!!”</p>
 <p>That had been Xu Shen’s first response when he saw the look in Bai Yunfei’s eyes. “Don’t kill me! I….I was only following orders! Xing Luo was the one behind this! He’s dead now, and he got what he deserved, I’m innocent in this! Please sire, spare my life! I...I won’t say anything! I’ll leave this city<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>no, I’ll leave this province! I’ll go far far away where no one will know who I am! Sire, please grant me mercy, spare the life of this lowly mongrel!”</p>
 <p>Pride, determination, and intrepid. Not every person had each of these three qualities, and in the face of death, many would often throw away these qualities and give up their self-dignity in order to beg for their lives.</p>
 <p>“Will you really not tell anyone? Will you leave this place, and never mention my name?” To Xu Shen’s immediate surprise<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>and relief—Bai Yunfei spoke what seemed to be the words of compromise to him.</p>
 <p>Unbeknownst to Xu Shen though, the crystalline bracelet on Bai Yunfei’s right hand flashed once with light as he spoke….</p>
 <p>Xu Shen’s eyes lit up. The ray of hope had shined down on him at last! He bowed his head at once, “Yes! I will! I won’t say your name ever! I never even saw you before, sire! Please spare my life!”</p>
 <p>In his abject terror and seemingly-earnest words, the man didn’t look like he was lying.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei studied the man for a few seconds, his lips eventually creeping into a cold smile. “I don’t like liars….”</p>
 <p>The blood drained away from Xu Shen’s face. Whatever begging words he was going to say next dried up in his mouth as he looked up, eyes flashing with maddened desperation!</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>Yellow light exploded from his both, forming into a shining sword of elemental metal to try and stab into Bai Yunfei’s body. Pushing against the ground from his kowtow position, the man flew to his feet and began to run away with all his might!</p>
 <p>The beckoning fear of death seized his mind. He didn’t want to wait for it without a fight; if there was no chance to flee, he’d go down fighting to his very last breath at the very least!</p>
 <p>The instantaneous velocity of a late-stage Soul Ancestor was fast enough to bring him a good two hundred meters away in one fluid moment. This brought him near the edge of this abandoned part of the city, and it didn’t seem like Bai Yunfei was chasing after him!</p>
 <p>Hope started to fill Xu Shen again, if he could keep this up, he’d be able to escape!</p>
 <p>But then as if like the envoy of death himself, a chirp from right behind his head dashed away his hopes. Turning around, he saw a black crescent-shape blade come down upon him….</p>
