 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

The Soul Consolidating Tea was as good as a panacea for him, and it felt like his concerns and troubles were all melting away whenever he drank it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another three days later, Bai Yunfei moved into the home given to him by the First Prince. He had now a place he could call home in the Capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was being helped by the Soul Consolidating Tea, Bai Yunfei felt a little impatient to hurry up and cure the side-effects he was undergoing. So most of his time was spent in his room meditating. Only when Zheng Kai sought him out did Bai Yunfei go outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from his increased recuperation, Bai Yunfei found yet another thing that was increasing….he was training at a far faster rate than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the Soul Consolidating Tea had done this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was it helpful for curing damages done to the soul, it could be used to help one cultivate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a monumental benefit that made the tea more than worth the one high-grade primal stone. In Bai Yunfei’s opinion, drinking the tea and using the high-grade primal stone were very comparable in terms of training either way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was already cultivating at a decent speed. With the tea, Bai Yunfei felt like it wouldn’t be long before he could become a late-stage Soul Exalt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had noticed a slight change undertake Xiao Qi as well. It was relatively ‘silent’ compared to before and frequently took to sleeping. Sometimes, it’d sleep on top of his shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever he was training, Bai Yunfei would feel slightly different from normal—a feeling of happiness was coming through to him from Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant….Xiao Qi was on its way to advancing in class!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Xiao Qi was a peak late-stage class six. If it advanced again, then…..it’d become a class seven!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei felt more excited for that than him becoming a late-stage Soul Exalt. A class seven soulbeast! Countless people and soulbeast could only yearn of growing to such a level like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But breaking through this bottleneck of a period wasn’t as easy as it seemed to be. Bai Yunfei knew that it might’ve looked like Xiao Qi was extremely close, but in reality, it would still need perhaps three or five years, if not a great opportunity….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue-eyes wyrm on the other hand, seemed jealous of Xiao Qi’s current state. It was stuck in the late-stage class six level without making any noticeable levels of improvement. Irritating the soulbeast, the wyrm began to train as hard as it could. Although it wasn’t making any leeway, it could still improve its soulforce slowly and surely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All in all, there were happy developments all around, and Bai Yunfei was content with that. After so many twist and turns in the Capital, Bai Yunfei was finally starting to feel that life was getting back on track….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The days went by soon enough, and Bai Yunfei soon found himself on the day of his next class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rather than go with Zheng Kai, Bai Yunfei opted to leave from his home and head for the academy himself. He had been familiarizing himself with the layout of the Capital, and now that his home was close to the academy, he wasn’t worried about getting lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was starting to treat the damages done to his soul, Bai Yunfei was starting to feel better about himself. It was with satisfaction that Bai Yunfei walked towards the academy, looking around at the students there whenever they passed. A feeling of joy arose in his mind, and a small hum couldn’t help but make its way towards Bai Yunfei’s lips to whistle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his happy mood would soon be shattered….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Yunfei! You stop right there!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had been halfway through the sixth year area and on his way to the gates leading to the Back Mountain when a sudden voice called out to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice hadn’t been very polite at all, and Bai Yunfei could feel the hostile but strong soulforce leaking out from this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Narrowing his eyes, Bai Yunfei sighed and turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A group of people was coming up to meet him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He watched as the group of twenty to thirty people stop in front of him, three middle-aged men in particular leading the group. Behind the three were what appeared to be guards of some kind while everyone else were male and females—evidently students of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Bai Yunfei had stopped walking, it didn’t take long for the group to catch up to him. In fact, some of them overtook Bai Yunfei so that he was stuck in a ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He eyed the crowd, “Is there a problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t recognize anyone from the crowd, so what business had them with him? And why were they so hostile towards him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Yunfei!! You have the nerve to pretend?!” The middle-aged man in maroon robes bristled, “You’ve been hiding for the past few days, but today you’ll pay us an explanation or else you don’t leave at all! Don’t think that because the chairman made you the crafting instructor you can allow your students to do as they please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei only narrowed his eyes at the person pointing his finger at him, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…!” The man paused briefly, not expecting such a response with him taking the initiative to speak, or that Bai Yunfei didn’t even know who he was. “I am the sixth year fire section instructor for class four, Lu Ren!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh.” Bai Yunfei nodded. “What business does instructor Lu have with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Lu Ren himself answered, the small-eyed middle-aged man next to him snorted, “Hmph! So you’re Bai Yunfei? Don’t even try pretending your way out of this. You will be make things right for the young master of my house, else the house of Xue will be forced to take the issue up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man wore a rare and expensive looking robe and was looking quite stoutly. He didn’t look like an instructor of the academy, so Bai Yunfei asked, “And who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Proudly, the man responded, “I am here on the behalf of the Chancellor of Finance, Xue Chunhou….and attendant to the house of Xue. Your student injured the young master of my house, so today you’ll be paying the compense for it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Bai Yunfei exclaimed—but not at the fact that there was a chancellor involved here. “My student hit your young master? What is the meaning behind this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He eyed in between the two middle-aged man to look at the young man whose hand was bandaged up. Besides him were a few other injured people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is the meaning of this? This one is really unaware of the details, please explain this for me.”</span></p>
