 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was the outside, a feat like this could be rationalized by saying this person was a Soul King. But this was inside the pocket, and no Soul King could be in here without the pocket collapsing. That meant this person was a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt at strongest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a terrifying prospect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something else about how he fought. He had exuded the aura of a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt when he received the halberd’s edge with his palm, but that was about it. The killing of the two others didn’t even resonate any bit of soulforce from him. He was like a calm pool of water when the deed was done, completely tranquil and without at all exerting his true strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt, but how could there be such a drastic difference in power like this between him and the others?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only reasonable explanation available right now would perhaps be that previously unassuming black needle of his….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing two people without at all being stopped by elemental energy or soul armaments. Flying fast and true. And being able to be controlled after being thrown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most incredible aspect of the needle was how the first person had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to him, his female companion had it lucky. Taking the needle through her forehead was without a doubt a surefire way to kill somebody, but the male had the needle go through his abdomen. No vital organ was in the proximity, and neither were there any special meridians that could be blocked. So how could the needle have killed him just as quickly as it did with the female?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black needle flew back to the hooded figure. He twirled the needle around his fingers a few times before finally holding it in place with his forefinger and thumb with a satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when the needle came to a stop that something special could be seen on it. In the moment the hooded figure pinched the needle, two wisps of black smoke rose up from it as if alive. The eyes of the man shined synchronously with his soulforce pulsating, the two black wisps of smoke then transferring from the needle into his body through his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flicker of emotion traversed across the person’s eyes as he ‘absorbed’ the wisps of smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked as if he was…enjoying something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I’m barely able to use you, but the effects are great. I can’t wait to completely perfect you, how strong will I become…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pleased whisper escaped from him as he stored away the black needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He drew in his soulforce after he was done and focused on listening to his surroundings for any fluctuations in the air. “I know I felt the space tremble a moment ago…so this pocket can really only handle the soulforce of a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt at most? Then in that case…what happens if someone stronger than that were to enter….?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes wandered over to the halberd he was holding in his left hand as he soliloquized to himself. Sneering, he tossed it down to the ground as if it were a piece of trash. At the edge of the halberd where his hand had been, several cracks could be seen….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the inverse, on the left hand of this man was a black glove. Not even a single tear or imperfection could be seen on the palm after it was struck. This meant that the glove was a powerfully defensive soul armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blocking the downward swing of the halberd couldn’t be solely placed on the glove though. It still required a tremendous amount of physical strength in order to not be affected by the concussive force, which meant this hooded figure was also terrifyingly strong in the physical sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet he pulled it off as if it was nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man looked away from the corpses. Nothing of interest was to be seen there, so he opted to look at the scenery around him instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surveyance of the surrounding scenery showed him something of interest. Of all the mountains in the area, only one of them had a peak glowing red. None of the other mountains or other types of landscape had anything else of extraordinary notice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes remained on the glowing red peak for a few seconds longer before they shifted slightly to the right. From there, he could see two streaks of light flying across the sky. It was clearly a flying-type soulbeast and a person riding it on top. As he thought, the two figures were flying straight for the strange peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That direction, is it?” The hooded figure looked pensive. “Alright then. That’s the direction to head in, perhaps I’ll be able to find the Extreme King Pills there…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sighed after taking another step forward, “Can’t kill the next person I see. I’ll have to question them first…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without even looting the space rings or soul armaments of the two people he had just killed, the man left the area soon after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been calm when he talked about the ‘Extreme King Pills’, though his face looked strangely excited when he talked about ‘killing’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What….was he here for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p>

He did say before that the mountain peak was roughly ‘twenty-five kilometers’ ahead, but now he was realizing just how off his estimate was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About thirty-five kilometers had already been traveled by now, and the mountain peak was still ‘off in the distance’....</span></p>

Exhausted has never meant so much to me before than now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At some point, even Zheng Kai was starting to pick up on the words Bai Yunfei loved to use.</span></p>

She looked much more relaxed than before, and a lot more healthy. All of the soulforce she had used before was more or less recovered, and she was even able to wash out the blood in her robes with her elemental water.</span></p>
