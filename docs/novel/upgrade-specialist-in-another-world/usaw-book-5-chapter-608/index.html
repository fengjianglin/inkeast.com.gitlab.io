 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Bai Yunfei woke up the next day, he immediately started to train in his room. Due to the weakness of his body, he had to have people come in to support him up. Rather than go out, Bai Yunfei practically secluded himself in his room for five straight days before he regained enough motor strength in his body to be able to walk around like normal. It took another five day for him to have enough motor ability to move like a commoner would.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The keyword here being ‘like a commoner would’. His current strength was still immensely low compared to what it was before, and he could hardly be classified as being as strong as the average commoner his age, let alone being quite robust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of the available soulforce for his body to use, Bai Yunfei couldn’t even said to be on the same level as a soul cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the change in his two essence fireseeds, the usage of his soulforce was very hard to distinguish. Even a Soul King would be hard-pressed to sense Bai Yunfei’s soulforce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like Bai Yunfei had completely lost his strength and was now a commoner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that he was able to regain enough bodily strength to move like a commoner had been gratifying enough. The horrifying thing was the fact that he found out that he….couldn’t progress from there after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Or well, it wasn’t as though he ‘couldn’t heal. It was just that healing was taking ten times slower than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the trend he was going at, returning to his peak level of strength would take an obscenely long amount of time…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was worried about it at first, but he soon came to the conclusion that he had to accept what life was giving him. If he had to heal slowly, then he wouldn’t force the issue. He’d put his effort to more meaningful tasks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like….upgrading.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Bai Yunfei regaining a certain amount of his strength back, Bai Yunfei was free to further deepen his research on the Upgrade Technique. Him upgrading the Critical Glove before had Bai Yunfei upgrading several more equipment he had, but he had unfortunately failed more often than not. Now that he was a stage stronger in soulforce though, Bai Yunfei was pleased to find out that manually upgrading the equipment was easier than using the Upgrade Technique. Because of that, Bai Yunfei spent most of his time using that method to pass the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from that, Bai Yunfei had a few other things he could do now that he could walk around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One early morning on North Seventh Street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Zheng Kai as his companion, Bai Yunfei and his three soulbeasts walked towards the Soothing Heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the relative earliness of that morning, there weren’t many people inside the Soothing Heart. Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai’s entrance into the building was met with Dan Teng coming down from the second floor to greet them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re finally back, Yunfei.” He greeted them with concern, “I heard about what happened to you in Baishan City, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As small as the Soothing Heart was, the soul cultivators he had as patrons were by no means minor. They were people who traveled in certain circles and were thus privy to more knowledge over the rumors than others. By extension, Dan Teng was able to hear about the circumstances behind Bai Yunfei, and it wasn’t as if the rumors were small in any case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grateful for his concern, Bai Yunfei smiled, “Thank you for your concern, uncle Dan. There’s a slight problem with my body that exacerbated the damage to my soul, if I could have uncle Dan help me out….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dang Teng blinked once before he honed his eyes onto Bai Yunfei, who felt a faint ripple of soulsense wash over him. The scanning took a while before Dan Teng sighed, “As I thought….the damage to your soul is worse than before. We can’t even call this a side-effect anymore, but rather a full blown tear in your soul again. Fortunately, it’s not incurable. It’ll take a little longer with the Soul Consolidating Tea, but I guarantee you that you’ll be fully healed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Bai Yunfei smiled. “I feel reassured then. Thank you very much, uncle Dan….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need. Shouldn’t I be the one to thank you for your patronage? Haha….come up to the second floor with me. Yi Shu, prepare a teapot of some Soul Consolidating Tea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei, Zheng Kai, and Dan Teng all enjoyed a cup of tea with each other before the former two left the Soothing Heart. How extraordinary the Soul Consolidating Tea felt to Bai Yunfei; the vexations in his heart felt like they had been drained away with each time he took a sip of that tea. And by the time he left the Soothing Heart, Bai Yunfei felt like he was gliding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was truly thankful for the Soothing Heart of Dan Teng and the Soul Consolidating Tea offered by them. If not for those, Bai Yunfei wouldn’t even know where to begin with how to deal with his current predicament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Life soon fell back into an ordinary cycle. In the morning, Bai Yunfei would head to the Soothing Heart for some tea and return to his place to meditate and practice manually upgrading. He’d return later in the day for another pot of Soul Consolidating Tea and return to his usual training. If not for the wounds he was trying to heal, it would be a very comfortable and relaxing lifestyle Bai Yunfei was living.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Early one morning almost ten days later….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had only just stepped out from the Soothing Heart after finishing his tea. Rather than walk home, he took another path and headed for Tianhun Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was feeling much more manageable than before, Bai Yunfei wanted to resume teaching. As an instructor, he didn’t want to ignore the students he was in charge of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having been notified earlier, his students were already waiting for him at the top of the mountain. In regards to what happened to Bai Yunfei in Baishan City, the students were far more knowledgeable than others. It was only natural in any case with them all working hard to find Fang Tianmeng the day before her rescue. Though they didn’t go to Baishan City to save her, what they heard from Fang Tianmeng astounded them all, and their respect for Bai Yunfei grew immensely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei wasn’t the only one getting some measure of newfound respect; Wu Yang was being received quite well with the other students now. The matter in which the fourth prince had stuck up for Fang Tianmeng in the dining hall and his efforts in utilizing the Royal Family—namely the First Prince to go help save Fang Tianmeng in Baishan City—had left its mark onto the other students. To them, Wu Yang wasn’t as hedonistic as the rumors claimed him to be. He wasn’t a bad character at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, even Mo Wanxia seemed to be treating him better than before, much to Wu Yang’s secret satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students and instructor spoke warmly with one another for a while before class started in earnest. “It’s been almost a month since our last class, I hope everyone has been practicing. How far have you all gotten?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Chen spoke up first, “Haha, of course we have! We’ve already starting crafting our own soul armaments, and….hehe, it’s not so bad!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shook his hand to retrieve a strange triple-tipped weapon and presented it graciously to Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei took the weapon into his hand to observe it. “This is...a mid-human tier soul armament! Did you craft this?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, instructor Bai’s amazing, you knew the tier of it with a single glance!” Mo Chen laughed, “Yeah, it’s the soul armament I crafted yesterday. How is it? Is it passable, instructor Bai?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could already craft a mid-human tier soul armament?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was surprised with Mo Chen’s progression. Nodding his head, he praised him, “Haha, not bad. Not bad at all. You’ve really exceeded my expectations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, it was nothing. Aside from Fang Tianmeng and her circumstances, everyone else beat me in crafting a mid-human tier soul armament.” Mo Chen laughed in embarrassment. “Big brother Ye Ming’s even more amazing, he was able to craft a high-human soul armament.”</span></p>

But now that Bai Yunfei looked at him, Ye Ming was back to being an early-stage Soul Exalt!</span></p>

Somehow I managed to breakthrough.”</span></p>

Unlike other methods of cultivation, crafting didn’t prioritize the elevation of soulforce. But if a crafter were to have success in their crafting attempt, there would be a great deal of energy that’d transfer from their attempt to themselves and benefit them greatly. Many crafters as a result took crafting to be a great chance to break the bottleneck they were at.</span></p>

Talent this high was comparable to the disciples of the Crafting School.</span></p>

Because of her kidnapping, Fang Tianmeng was slightly behind in terms of success, but even she was able to craft a low-human tier soul armament. The others were all able to craft a mid-human tier soul armament which gave Bai Yunfei no small amount of surprise.</span></p>

I’ll look over how you all craft and then teach you some of the more specific ways to use certain materials when crafting….”</span></p>

The heat in the area grew as well, and before long, the entire mountain peak was washed with a red glow.</span></p>
