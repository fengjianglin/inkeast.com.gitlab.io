 <p>Chapter 393: A Challenging Battle</p>
 <p>The barrier had collapsed as soon as the the wolf was upon it!</p>
 <p>But the barrier did its job; the attack of the wolf had lost all momentum and power.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei leapt backwards as quickly as he could, widening the distance between them by several hundred meters before erecting another barrier when he came to a stop.</p>
 <p>Rather than to let its prey go, the thunderfire wolf followed suit. Its entire body was basked in purple and red light before disappearing in a blur to attempt to devour Bai Yunfei again!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was afraid to use the Cataclysmic Seal to attack. Whether he enlarged it to attack with a push or a stamp, the wolf would be able to dodge both with ease and get close.</p>
 <p>He needed the Cataclysmic Seal more for its defenses than its offense!</p>
 <p>Its defenses was what he was relying most on right now. Thus, attacking the wolf was disastrously dangerous. His Desert Eagles were already back in his ring so that he could use the Fire-tipped Spear in conjunction with the Wave Treading Steps to avoid danger.</p>
 <p>Soon, one Bai Yunfei turned into three to stab at the thunderwolf!</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang!”</p>
 <p>The Bai Yunfei in the middle was snapped up in the wolf’s jaws and the one on the right had been torn in two by its claws in a matter of moments!</p>
 <p>The doppelgangers served their purpose, however. They weren’t meant to attack, but to distract! With the wolf distracted, the Bai Yunfei on the left was able to stab at its armors with a burst of concentrated elemental power!</p>
 <p>“Booom!!”</p>
 <p>The spark of contact triggered the Fire-tipped Spear’s additional effect, sending the wolf flying away from Bai Yunfei. Careening into several trees, it tumbled across the ground, but….it wasn’t hurt at all!</p>
 <p>“So….this is the might of a late-stage class six soulbeast….” Bai Yunfei frowned. The two had only touched for just a small moment, but it was long enough for Bai Yunfei to really understand his chances against the wolf. Victory was practically impossible, and just withstanding one of the wolf’s attacks would be a good question to ask right now….</p>
 <p><em>“Should I use that then?”</em> Hesitation played on Bai Yunfei’s mind,<em>&nbsp;“No. I shouldn’t. Even if I get rid of the wolf, how am I going to deal with the soul cultivator? Should I kill him first then?”</em></p>
 <p>He was operating under very bad conditions right now. There was a very powerful foe near him, and his ‘coil’ form was close to expiring, so he had to attack now!!</p>
 <p>He snarled. The thunderfire wolf would have to be forgotten about for now. Turning around, he flew off into the air to scale a hundred meters high into the sky to where the beast tamer was!</p>
 <p><em>“He wants to attack me first? How ridiculous!”</em> The beast tamer knew straight away what Bai Yunfei was planning. It was a common tactic for other people to attack the beast tamer, but how could he let Bai Yunfei do as he pleased? Lifting his right hand, a purple figure flew straight out from the forest to stop Bai Yunfei; it was the thunderfire wolf.</p>
 <p>Somehow, as if he knew just where and when the wolf would come from, Bai Yunfei came to a stop and raised his left hand to have the Cataclysmic Seal in it detach from him. The orange light from the brick was replaced by red and sailed for the wolf, increasing in size as it did.</p>
 <p>By the time the brick reached the wolf, it was already as big as a house!</p>
 <p>It was a perfect counter for the situation. The wolf hadn’t a way to dodge the brick, but…..for a late-stage class six soulbeast, the brick wouldn’t be enough to pose a threat to it!</p>
 <p>Howling loudly, the wolf’s entire body flashed with even more soulforce than before before elemental fire and lightning came ‘rushing’ out from it to slam into the Cataclysmic Seal!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!!”</p>
 <p>Lights of purple and fire illuminated half the sky with countless sloughed-off blobs of elemental lightning and fire scattering this way and that to cover up the Cataclysmic Seal!</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal itself had stopped its forward momentum to freeze there in the air. And then, with time, it….started to fly backwards!</p>
 <p>A sneer crawled onto the beast tamer’s face.</p>
 <p><em>“You think yourself impressive with all your soul armaments, but your own strength isn’t equally impressive, even I can kill you!”</em></p>
 <p>His losses were bigger than expected, but victory was all but assured for him. Bai Yunfei was using those soul armaments like crutches, so if everything went according to his expectations then, Bai Yunfei would only be able to last for just another twenty-five minutes.</p>
 <p>After that, he wouldn’t even have to step in himself to make sure Bai Yunfei wouldn’t be able to fight back.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Just then, something sparked confusion in the beast tamer, “This feeling, it’s…”</p>
 <p>Completely unexpected to him, the Cataclysmic Seal suddenly turned small to fly behind Bai Yunfei, where the beast tamer realized just what he was doing, “This move again?!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had retreated a hundred meters away from where he once was. His entire figure was completely overwhelmed in red, and both of his arms were by his sides with coils of intense flames around them as well.</p>
 <p>And just when the beast tamer caught sight of Bai Yunfei, Bai Yunfei punched out!</p>
 <p>Dual Dragon Burst!!</p>
 <p>The two fiery dragons came forth from his hands before spiralling towards the thunderfire wolf protecting the beast tamer!</p>
 <p>Before, this move costed the beast tamer his twin-headed vulture, so the beast tamer was extremely loathe to lose his thunderfire wolf here. With a mental command, he sent the thunderfire wolf away to dodge the dragons.</p>
 <p>This however, left the beast tamer himself open to the dragons, since the wolf had been the only thing in the way between him and Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>“Hmph! You think this’d be enough to hit me?” The beast tamer sneered. The dragons might’ve been moving at great speeds, but he was still a late-stage Soul Exalt<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>a being just below that of a Soul King! How in the world would he be struck down by a move like this again?!</p>
 <p>Concentrating soulforce to his feet, the beast tamer pushed mightily off the ground to avoid the two dragons!</p>
 <p>The Dual Dragon Burst missing didn’t seem to bother Bai Yunfei. Rather than disappointment, a flash of light entered his eyes.</p>
 <p>While the beast tamer was preoccupied with ordering the thunderfire wolf to attack him, Bai Yunfei’s hand pressed against each other to form a seal before then pointing both hands forward and then to the side!</p>
 <p>The Dual Dragon Burst….wasn’t only capable of going in one direction!!</p>
 <p>In a spectacularly strange sight, the two dragons a hundred meters below the beast tamer suddenly split apart in response to Bai Yunfei’s hand movements!</p>
 <p>And then, Bai Yunfei’s hands flew up before clasping together again!</p>
 <p>Just like that, the two dragons changed directions like changing the corner, but upwards rather than left or right. They flew up to the same height as the beast tamer before following Bai Yunfei’s hand to come together to….….hit the beast tamer!</p>
 <p>From the very start of the battle, the beast tamer had been put into a corner by Bai Yunfei one after another. It was almost as though the seventy years of experience the old man had wasn’t worth a squat against Bai Yunfei, and right now, the beast tamer was in the most dangerous spot yet!</p>
 <p>Not only did the dragons change direction quickly, but without warning. The beast tamer hadn’t even stabilized himself in the air yet when the dragons came from left and right to slam against him!</p>
 <p>His face paled drastically. There wasn’t even time for him to even command the thunderfire wolf, the man had nothing else on his mind but to….explode!</p>
 <p>Explode with all his remaining strength! This way, he’d be able to save himself!</p>
 <p>“Bang!!” Red light began to pour out from the beast tamer as all of his elemental fire drained away from his body and surround himself in it like an egg! In the next second, the two dragons slammed into the elemental fire shield!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!”</p>
 <p>With terrifying force, the two dragons slammed into the egg. A maelstrom of fire exploded into the world and set the entire mountain behind the beast tamer on fire and even causing parts of the mountain to quake and collapse!</p>
 <p>All of the red light and fire flying off from this circular sphere the beast tamer was in made him seem like he was situated in a miniature sun. All of the trees and wood underneath him were unable to handle the height combusted into flames!</p>
 <p>On the other side when he was preoccupied, Bai Yunfei was assaulted by a strong gust of wind before a pair of very sharp claws came tearing for his chest!</p>
