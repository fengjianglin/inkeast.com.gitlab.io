 <p>Chapter 40: Researching Item Stats Again</p>
 <p>“Alright, now I’m going to explain to you the effects of these two daggers. You’ve got to understand and remember them, so that when you use them in combat later, you’ll know exactly what to do.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei then carefully explained the effects of the two daggers to Li Chengfeng. After making sure that the latter had understood and remembered them, he put the dagger in his hand away and replaced it with a +8 normal dagger, saying, “Let’s test their effects in detail now. There are still some things I don’t understand. I need to study them more carefully...”</p>
 <p>“Oh, then how do we test them?” Li Chengfeng nodded repeatedly and asked expectantly.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to fight or something. We’ll only research its effects. I’ll use this dagger to defend and you’ll attack me with the dagger in your hand. Just do it slowly. You should already understand this, right? I remember when we were testing the brick last time, you quite enjoyed hitting me with it...”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, I already know what to do, let’s get started.” Li Chengfeng laughed in an embarrassed manner and said.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, let’s begin.”</p>
 <p>Li Chengfeng raised his dagger and slowly brought it down towards Bai Yunfei. Bai Yunfei also raised the dagger in his hand and blocked this ‘attack’ from him.</p>
 <p>“Hm, use a little less force. Let’s continue.” Bai Yunfei looked at the nick that had just appeared on the blade because of the collision and warned.</p>
 <p>The two daggers then hit each other this way about a dozen times. The dagger in Bai Yunfei’s hand was already full of nicks. After all, the dagger in Li Chengfeng’s hand towered over it in terms of damage.</p>
 <p>Another slight sound of collision was heard. Bai Yunfei subconsciously wanted to say “It still hasn’t come, continue.” Only, when he had just opened his mouth and these words had yet to come out of it, everything before his eyes turned black and he could no longer see anything.</p>
 <p>“Blinding!” After being stupefied for a second, Bai Yunfei reacted instantly by shouting, “Stop!”</p>
 <p>In fact, Li Chengfeng had noticed it as soon as this effect had been activated because at that moment, a strand of his soulforce had flowed into the dagger uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei did not channel his soulforce to resist. Instead, he carefully experienced this ‘blind’ state. Three seconds passed very quickly. The light reappeared and the world in front of him returned to normal.</p>
 <p>“How was it, Yunfei? Just now it was the blinding effect, right?” Seeing that the dagger in Bai Yunfei’s hand had remained unchanged, Li Chengfeng knew that the triggered effect should have been ‘blinding’.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, you’re right. It was the blinding effect. The whole world suddenly turned into darkness and I couldn’t see anything, but the other senses were left intact.” Bai Yunfei carefully recalled the feeling just then, “This effect is exceptionally useful. If such a situation suddenly occurs during combat...”</p>
 <p>“Let’s continue. We’ll test that ‘severing’ effect now.” Bai Yunfei thought for a while and said.</p>
 <p>After another dozen collisions, the moment the two daggers hit each other again, Li Chengfeng had a happy expression, saying, “Here it comes!”</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time as he said those words, Bai Yunfei felt his hand lighten. The moment the two daggers had come into contact, there had been no sound of collision at all. The dagger in Li Chengfeng’s hand had completely cut through the dagger used to block by Bai Yunfei at one stroke as if cutting through a piece of tofu.</p>
 <p>Li Chengfeng looked at the dagger in his hand then at the fallen half of the blade on the ground in a somewhat stupefied manner and murmured, “This... is the ‘severing’ effect? It cuts through the opponent’s weapon directly?!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked at the half of the dagger in his hand. The cut surface of the blade was smooth. Obviously the dagger had been cut in half without hindrance.</p>
 <p><em>“This +12 additional effect is really terrifying. Severing... though it’s hard to trigger if the enemy’s weapon is of high-grade, only inheritance grade equipment and above can prevent it from being triggered completely.</em></p>
 <p><em>“In other words, it can ‘sever’ all the soul armaments of the same grade as the Glacial Piercer as well!”</em></p>
 <p>... ... ... ...</p>
 <p>Afterwards, the two of them began to test the effects of the other +12 dagger.</p>
 <p>During the test, when Li Chengfeng thrust his dagger out and activated the ‘illusion’ effect, Bai Yunfei saw obviously that the dagger was aimed at his heart. But when it was about to reach him, it was aimed at his stomach!</p>
 <p>The illusion effect made the opponent see an illusory strike as a real strike, confusing the opponent’s vision, allowing the user to attack another place by surprise!</p>
 <p>As for the other effect, namely, ‘in downward attacks using the tip of the blade, damage is doubled’, it was self-explanatory so they did not have to specifically do extra research on it.</p>
 <p>The two of them tested the effects again and again in that vacant area for an entire morning. Only when they had understood all the effects completely did they stop.</p>
 <p>“I’ve made my decision! These two daggers will be called Severing and Illusion respectively!” Sitting on the ground, Li Chengfeng looked at the two daggers in his hand and said all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, they are yours, of course you’re the one to name them. Did you choose their names according to their effects? Yeah, pretty good names.” Bai Yunfei laughed and said with a nod on one side.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, you’re really terrific. How did you do this? Even the sharpness of these daggers has been improved by god knows how much compared to before, not to mention those marvelous effects.” Caressing the two daggers in his hands admiringly, Li Chengfeng could not help sighing with emotion.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, the damages of these two daggers are almost comparable to that of the non-upgraded Glacial Piercer, which means they should have already reached the threshold of soul armaments. However, I’m not sure if they can actually be counted as soul armaments or not. After all, now I still don’t know much about soul armaments.”</p>
 <p>At this point, seeming to think of something, Bai Yunfei took out an space ring, held it out to Li Chengfeng and said, “Take your space ring. I upgraded it a bit too. But I didn’t upgrade it to the point where an additional effect would appear because if I had tried and failed, it would have been destroyed for nothing.”</p>
 <p>Li Chengfeng received the ring and said doubtfully, “This one can also be upgraded?”</p>
 <p>“Just put it on and experience it a bit.” Bai Yunfei laughed and suggested that he experienced it himself.</p>
 <p>The moment Li Chengfeng put the ring on his finger, he was obviously stupefied. Afterwards, he looked at his own body and at the ring on his finger somewhat doubtfully. Then he turned to Bai Yunfei and said with uncertainty, “Yunfei, why am I feeling...”</p>
 <p>“You’re feeling that your body is lighter and lither than before, right?” Bai Yunfei said smilingly, “Your feeling is not wrong at all. The rings I upgrade won’t provide additional damage or defense, but they will increase the body’s ‘attributes’. The one on my finger increases ‘strength’ and yours increases ‘agility’.”</p>
 <p>After Bai Yunfei had upgraded this space ring of Li Chengfeng’s to +8, its additional attribute was an increase of 18 points to agility.</p>
 <p>“Though the number of additional points is not large, something is still better than nothing. Too bad I don’t have time, otherwise I’d still be able to experiment a bit with the attributes of various kinds of jewelry after they are upgraded to high levels...” Bai Yunfei said with some regret.</p>
 <p>When Li Chengfeng heard these words, his expression immediately darkened. He said, “You’re prepared to go? When?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei thought for a while and said, “Tomorrow. I’ll have a good rest tonight and leave tomorrow morning.”</p>
 <p>“You’re not going to say something to the people in the village?”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m not. There’s no need to disturb them. I don’t like a farewell scene with too many people.” Bai Yunfei shook his head, “After I leave, you must warn the people in the village that, if the Zhang family’s men come and ask questions, they must not show any weak points and must act as if they don’t know me.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I got it. Don’t worry. Everybody has the previous experience of dealing with people who come here to probe so there won’t be any problem.”</p>
 <p>... ... ... ...</p>
