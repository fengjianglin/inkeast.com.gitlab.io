 <p>Chapter 176: Wiping Out the Enemies</p>
 <p>Practically jeering, Su Xia gave a mocking laugh at Bai Yunfei, “What’s wrong? Surprised? Was the Crescent Moon Blade stronger than it was before? Haha! If you want to find out why, make sure my brother teaches you a good lesson about it when you reach him in the underworld!”</p>
 <p>Filled with resentment, Su Xia stalked towards Bai Yunfei with one heavy step at a time. His blade glowed brightly with a light-green color and an aura that felt exceedingly chilly.</p>
 <p>In no time at all, Su Xia stood above the limp-bodied Bai Yunfei with his blade held up high. With eyes that radiated with a near insane but lazy light, he howled, “Time to die!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Su Xia’s blade came crescending downwards, Bai Yunfei lifted his head to cry out loud, “Shao Ling, now!”</p>
 <p>These three words caused an immediate reaction. Su Xia’s blade came to a screeching stop while his own face blanched.</p>
 <p>He remembered now!</p>
 <p>It was because of these three words that his now deceased brother was ambushed and killed!</p>
 <p>Thus, fear clouded his mind and judgement. Almost instinctively, Su Xia’s foot pushed off against the ground to whirl around with his blade to slice out at<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>absolutely nothing!</p>
 <p>The blade tasted nothing but air, and for the life of him, Su Xia couldn’t see anyone no matter where he turned his head to.</p>
 <p><em>“Fuck, I was tri<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>”</em></p>
 <p>Barely a moment later, an even stronger amount of fear flooded his heart. Palefaced, Su Xia swung his head around just in time to see two bright eyes burning with a furious red….</p>
 <p>“Pppfttt!”</p>
 <p>A faint sizzling sound followed the slight stench of something burning<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>this was what Su Xia could hear and smell in his last moments to life.</p>
 <p>A burn mark was etched deep into Su Xia’s body from his left shoulder to his right waist. While this burn mark was strongly burnt into his body, it hadn’t been thorough enough to completely bisect the man in half. But still, black-colored blood spilled out from the wound to amass beneath the wide-eyed Su Xia. Teetering on his feet for a slight moment, the man’s corpse then came collapsing onto the ground behind him with eyes glossed over.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Bai Yunfei was half kneeling on the ground with his left hand pressed against his waist and his right hand on the ground. Right above his shoulder, a ball of flame slowly flickered out from sight….</p>
 <p>Flame Winged Blade!</p>
 <p>On his right forefinger, a black ring glistened slightly with a gradually dimming light.</p>
 <p>Space Ring’s +10 additional effect:</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Stockpile 300 soulpoints to be used whenever. This does not count towards the soulpoints within the body.</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Whew…”</p>
 <p>Falling to his butt, Bai Yunfei let out a drawn out sigh from relief. His entire body was wet with sweat, and the area around his waist was still bleeding quite heavily.</p>
 <p>Several seconds passed in this fashion before Bai Yunfei finished absorbing all of the soulforce stockpiled in the space ring. Waving his right hand, several spirit-increasing accessories dropped to the ground in front of him for him to wear. With those, Bai Yunfei’s soulforce recovery would be accelerated, allowing for him to completely heal from his wounds in no time.</p>
 <p>“Bro<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>brother Bai….are you okay?”</p>
 <p>The quavering voice of Shao Ling made itself known to Bai Yunfei, prompting him to turn his head towards the source. Right there was the strawhat wearing, brick holding Shao Ling not too far away with a look of concern on his face.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine, don’t worry about me….” Bai Yunfei nodded his head before struggling back up to his feet. “Let’s take a look at Zhu Zi and see what his wounds are.”</p>
 <p>“Ah! Brother Zhu Zi!” Shao Ling yelped; because of the high tension moment with Su Xia and the fact that Bai Yunfei had killed two men in a terrifyingly unforgettable fashion, Shao Ling had practically forgotten about Zhu Zi. So when Bai Yunfei mentioned Zhu Zi’s name, Shao Ling remembered at last the situation and ran off to where Xiao Fang and Zhu Zi was.</p>
 <p>Xiao Fang was completely still from on top of the tree perch she was on. The only thing that moved from her body was her constant flow of tears, making her seem more like a crying statue rather than a human as she beheld the blood-soaked figure of Zhu Zi by her side.</p>
 <p>In contrast to her, Zhu Zi was completely soaked with blood. His mouth had a small rivulet of blood flowing from it, and his face was abnormally pale due to blood loss. His eyebrows were knitted together in a clear sign of the pain he was in.</p>
 <p>But at the very least; he was alive! The Crescent Moon Blade had only cut at his chest rather than killing him!</p>
 <p>Approaching Zhu Zi’s body, Bai Yunfei knelt down and checked for a pulse. After confirming there was no life-threatening wounds, Bai Yunfei felt all of his concerns drain away.</p>
 <p>Taking out several strength-increasing accessories, he ordered Shao Ling to help put them on Zhu Zi. Whatever reason why Bai Yunfei wanted this, Shao Ling didn’t know, but he knew better than to ask and swiftly did as Bai Yunfei said.</p>
 <p>This attribute ‘strength’, as it was known on the accessories, had many categorizations. ‘Energy’, ‘endurance’, ‘instantaneous power’, and even ‘rate of recovery’. For the common person, it could increase their physical strength and boost all of the abovementioned factors. This meant that with all of these accessories worn, Zhu Zi would find himself recovering very quickly.</p>
 <p>Putting one hand on one seam of Zhu Zi’s clothing and the other hand some distance apart, Bai Yunfei ripped at his clothes so as to reveal the bisected Heart Protecting Mirror. This was the soul armament with a hole that Bai Yunfei taken from one of the members of the Beast Taming School.</p>
 <p>Prior to the entire battle, Bai Yunfei instructed the two males to hide far away and wait for when the battle started in order to find an opportunity. It was a gamble, but it paid off when Bai Yunfei figured that it’d be best to give Zhu Zi the soul armament after seeing how worried the male was for Xiao Fang.</p>
 <p>In the end, Su Xia ended up finding out about their plan and delivered a swift chop at Zhu Zi in hopes of killing him. If not for Bai Yunfei giving him the item, Zhu Zi would’ve had no chance at living at all.</p>
 <p>But even with the Heart Protecting Mirror, the wound Zhu Zi sustained was deep enough to see bone, and even his internal organs could almost be seen peaking out behind his skin.</p>
 <p>For Shao Ling, Bai Yunfei entrusted him with the Walk-on Strawhat and the +13 brick. Originally, Bai Yunfei didn’t plan on having Shao Ling help out at all. But the battle was far more intense than he thought and Shao Ling was more than willing to do his part to help kill Tang Ya before indirectly helping tie up the final battle.</p>
 <p>Untying Xiao Fang from her confines, Bai Yunfei handed her some first-aid equipment so she could treat Zhu Zi. Then, Bai Yunfei spoke several more words before sitting back down to focus on recovering his own wounds.</p>
 <p>Nightfell came before Bai Yunfei finally let out a long exhale. Opening his eyes, he took notice that the wounds on his waist and right shoulder were all but healed. His left arm still hurt something fierce, but it was nothing unmanageable.</p>
 <p>The sight of Shao Ling and Xiao Fang guarding Zhu Zi’s body greeted Bai Yunfei upon first glance. Neither of the two dared to say anything the entire time in fear that they would bother him.</p>
 <p>Realizing that Bai Yunfei was ‘awake’, Shao Ling immediately let out a question, “Brother Bai, are you okay now?”</p>
 <p>Smiling, Bai Yunfei spoke, “Ah, I’m fine. You can relax now.”</p>
 <p>“Lo<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>lord Bai…..thank you for saving me…..” Xiao Fang’s voice was faint and her face was haggard. After experiencing the events she did today and the unforgettable battle that took place for her, the delicate young woman had her fair share of lingering fears.</p>
 <p>Rather than feeling happy about being thanked, Bai Yunfei felt guilty. It was because of him that this situation happened. If he wasn’t here, then Xiao Fang and the other two wouldn’t have been in danger to begin with.</p>
 <p>“Miss Xiao Fang, there’s no need for that. If anything, I should be the one apologizing to you. Everything was because of me after all….” Bai Yunfei nodded to Zhu Zi, “But you don’t need to be that concerned. Zhu Zi is fine, I can guarantee that in three days, he’ll be back to normal.”</p>
 <p>“Really? But...his wounds are so serious….” For a moment, Xiao Fang’s lit up before frowning again.</p>
 <p>“Sis, haven’t you realized that brother Bai isn’t any ordinary person? He’s amazing! If he says so, then it has to be true!” Shao Ling spoke with reinvigorated enthusiasm.</p>
 <p>Using his soulforce to aid in Zhu Zi’s recovery, Bai Yunfei had the wounds on his chest healed up in practically no time at all before taking a small break. Stepping away to let Xiao Fang and Shao Ling look at him, Bai Yunfei turned his head to look around the place.</p>
 <p>The entire place around them was practically a wasteland with scars of battle to be seen everywhere. Tang Ya and Su Xia’s space rings were quickly confiscated by Bai Yunfei before the Crescent Moon Blades were taken as well. From there, Bai Yunfei burnt their bodies to ashes and let it scatter away into the winds to hide the evidence.</p>
