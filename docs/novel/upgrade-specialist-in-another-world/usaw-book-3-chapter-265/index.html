 <p>Chapter 265: Upgrading Accessories</p>
 <p>Xiao Er looked at the sword in his hand in utter befuddlement; he wasn’t even fully aware when Bai Yunfei continued to speak to him.</p>
 <p>Too many things were happening for him to really understand the situation. Bai Yunfei wanted him to buy accessories of all things, and from what he was saying, it didn’t matter what type of accessories as long as Xiao Er bought a lot of them. This only served to confuse Xiao Er even more.</p>
 <p>“Brother Xiao, this matter is extremely important to me. Please!!” Bai Yunfei spoke with a grave face.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Bai Yunfei wasn’t joking with him, Xiao Er decided to put away his suspicions. “I don’t understand what brother Bai wants with them, but… I’ll do it! This won’t be a problem; we have plenty of accessories on hand. I’ll have some men bring them over at once!”</p>
 <p>He looked back down at the sword in his hands in confusion. Since he was only a mid-stage Soul Warrior, he had very limited dealings with soul armaments, so he wasn’t able to tell how strong the soul armament was. One thing was for sure, this soul armament was surely stronger than the low-human tier one his grandfather had taken from one of his dead enemies.</p>
 <p>The sword shook a little in his hand from his hesitance, but Xiao Er finally tore his eyes away from it long enough to push it back to Bai Yunfei, “Something this minor shouldn’t warrant such a precious gift like this. Please take it back, brother Bai, or I’ll feel ashamed for having taken it...”</p>
 <p>It was clearly obvious to see that Xiao Er took a fancy to this sword, but for him to refuse it even then? Bai Yunfei found a newfound level of respect for Xiao Er.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said it before,” Bai Yunfei shook his head, “This matter is extremely important to me. The reason I need these accessories might be beyond you, brother Xiao, but I can’t explain the reason just yet. If you can help me make the purchases, then this soul armament should be yours as my thanks. I would feel unwell if you didn’t.”</p>
 <p>His honesty was so apparent that even Xiao Er found it hard to refuse now (He didn’t want to refuse either in truth). Several seconds later, Xiao Er took the sword with a solemn expression, “Brother Bai, don’t worry. As long as you need them, I’ll prepare them for you even if I have to clear out the entire city of accessories!!”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps… perhaps that will be necessary…” Bai Yunfei’s voice was so inaudible that Xiao Er had almost missed it.</p>
 <p>“Eh? What was that, brother Bai?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s nothing… I’ll be waiting in my room then. Please send them over straight away when you have the first few, brother Xiao.”</p>
 <p>“No worries, I’ll instruct my men to send some right now!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Xiao Er left quickly after that, leaving Bai Yunfei free to return to his room only to notice that Xiao Er’s maids had already left a platter of food and medicines of varying rarity. Many of them were commonplace goods, but he had never once used these medicines before.</p>
 <p>After everything today, Bai Yunfei was feeling slightly peckish, so he ate from the platter first before resting on top of his bed.</p>
 <p>Not long later, a maid came into his room to present to him a space ring with all the accessories Xiao Er managed to find in Curopia City so far. After receiving Bai Yunfei’s gift of thanks, Xiao Er went into the city himself to do as Bai Yunfei asked, but even if he hadn’t received a gift, there was no way Xiao Er would be negligent in his role as Bai Yunfei’s host.</p>
 <p>Now that he was on his bed, Bai Yunfei looked at the space ring given to him. At a precursory glance, Bai Yunfei could see that there were over a thousand accessories in there, causing Bai Yunfei to be surprised. According to what Xiao Er said, this must be the ones the Xiao already had—a tremendous amount already, but with all these accessories, Xiao Er would most definitely be the target of anger of many of the females in the Xiao. In the future, Xiao Er would definitely have to apologize properly to all of them.</p>
 <p>“Well… let’s start then!”</p>
 <p>With a small sigh to calm himself, Bai Yunfei took a purple ring first.</p>

 <p><em>“Increases strength, that’s useless…”</em> Bai Yunfei narrowed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Putting away the ring, Bai Yunfei took out another jade bracelet and thought to himself, “Upgrade.”</p>

 <p>Once again, Bai Yunfei swapped out the bracelet for a new ring.</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade.”</em></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Several minutes later, Bai Yunfei had already gone through eight accessories before he finally got the attribute he wanted…</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei sighed as he looked at the amber necklace in his hand, <em>“Finally an accessory that increases spirit. The chances of one of these appearing is really small… so far, I’ve probably created less than a hundred of these out of a thousand accessories. The chances of them reaching +10 are even lower, and then even those who have the effect of increasing regeneration rate was even smaller…”</em></p>
 <p>The more Bai Yunfei thought about it, the more depressed he became. At first mention, a thousand accessories were very good, but in the end, it would be very likely that not a single one would be left.</p>
 <p><em>“This isn’t enough, but Xiao Er’s going to the city to buy some more. I shouldn’t have to worry about the quantity for now.”</em> Bai Yunfei thought to himself, <em>“I’ll take a look at these ones first and pick out the spirit increasing ones before I upgrade them. That should last me the entire night…</em></p>
 <p><em>“I hope that a soulforce regenerating accessory comes soon…”</em> Bai Yunfei prayed to himself before picking up the one spirit increasing accessory again.</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>With each accessory upgraded, Bai Yunfei sorted them in accordance to what their effects were and grouped them together. This sort of classification had been done once before when he gave several accessories to Jing Mingfeng, so he had some experience in this aspect. Therefore, sorting was relatively quick, and within a single hour, Bai Yunfei had each and every single one of the thousand accessories compiled in neat piles.</p>
 <p>So far, he had one hundred sixty-three accessories that could increase spirit. Many of them were ‘High’ grade while the rest were ‘Superior.’</p>
 <p>After resting and recovering his soulforce, Bai Yunfei took one of the many upgraded accessories into his hand. With two deep breaths, Bai Yunfei then upgraded the item to +8.</p>
 <p>Any upgrade after this meant the destruction of the equipment if he failed. After going through all of the one hundred sixty-three accessories, Bai Yunfei noted that only thirty-nine of them were able to reach the +9 level…</p>
 <p>With that final notice, Bai Yunfei blacked out.</p>
 <p>He came to a start when he realized that it was already daybreak of the following day. Staring at the earring in his hand, Bai Yunfei muttered, “This next part is the most important part! May the heavens grant me a chance to get a soulforce regenerating effect!!”</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>

 <p>“...” Bai Yunfei shook his head after a moment of silence. Dusting the powder off his hands, Bai Yunfei took another one of the +9 accessories and proceeded to upgrade it.</p>
 <p>Failure, failure, and failure…</p>
 <p>It wasn’t until the sixth equipment when…</p>
