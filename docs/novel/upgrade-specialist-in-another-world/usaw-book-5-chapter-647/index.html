 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

With the hurricane more or less gone and the thunderclouds scattered, everyone could see that the skies were back to to their normal color and that the natural disaster-like image from before was gone as if it had only been an illusion before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the entire area was sweltering with heat as if there was now a severe drought in the area, reminding everyone that the events taking place here was indeed real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yao’er!!”</span></p>

A streak of purple light came flying from Wu Hong’s side with such great speed that the person moving had disappeared completely from sight just three meters after he moved. Reappearing half a kilometer away, the person was holding a person in his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who suddenly came forth from the audience was the Minister of the Right, Cheng Huayu, and the person he was holding was his son Cheng Yao!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Yao’s robes was in a raggedy state. Singed all over and his hair messy, Cheng Yao looked as if he had only just escaped from a burning wildfire. Having fallen from the skies before Cheng Huayu took him into his arms, Cheng Yao was having a hard time trying to stand right now. His entire body was trembling fiercely and his face was deathly white. But both of his eyes weren’t look at his father who saved him, but at the area where he fell from with a look of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His lips trembled for a moment as if he was trying to search for the right words to say. Then, his mouth dropped open to ‘puke’ out a large amount of blood!!</span></p>

His eyes rolled over to the back of his head and then….he fainted!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Huayu was a lightning-type mid-stage Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was feeding his son his soulforce, Cheng Huayu was also scanning Cheng Yao’s body with his soulsense in panic. After not seeing anything too serious, the panic in Cheng Huayu’s face faded away. He turned away to stare where Cheng Yao had fallen with wrathful indignation and even a bit of killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Floating a hundred meters high in the sky from where the elemental fire was still burning was a single person who slowly stepped forward and out from the fires.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like Cheng Yao, his robes were in a state of disarray, but not as badly as the other. His face was slightly pale, his breathing hitched, and his soulforce slightly waned. But compared to Cheng Yao, Bai Yunfei was in a far better state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the spar in front of the nobles of the empire was over, and the result was….clear to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei watched on as Cheng Huayu gave him a nasty glare with raised eyebrows. He wasn’t really afraid. He was sure that Cheng Huayu wanted to kill Bai Yunfei but couldn’t due to the current place they were in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sounds of footsteps echoed through the air as Wu Hong and the others came forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei stood to attention and faced Cheng Yao being held by Cheng Huayu. “Lord Cheng, I’ve won.” He spoke ‘politely’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an unkindly thing to say at the end of something and nearly led to Cheng Yao fainting again. There was a hiccup in his breathing as his lips trembled slightly. Reluctant and wanting to say something, Cheng Yao found himself unable to actually speak any words and could only think about how unbelievable it was for him to lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei turned back to face Wu Hong and the others, “Your Majesty….” He began respectfully.</span></p>

It was a wonderful fight between the two of you. I am pleased to see it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ruler turned to Cheng Huayu and his son next, “How is Cheng Yao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eyes still burning slightly with anger, Cheng Huayu managed to reply to the ruler, “Thank you for your concern, your Majesty. Yao’er is slightly injured, but nothing consequential.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone could tell that Cheng Yao was definitely not ‘slightly injured’, but Cheng Huayu would never admit that his son had been more than just ‘slightly’ injured by Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Instructor Bai, are you alright?” Wu Yang rushed to Bai Yunfei to whisper to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m fine, nothing consequential either.” Bai Yunfei shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was making use of the same lines as well. He might’ve looked a lot better than Cheng Yao, but he was putting up a good front to hide his pains. The battle just now had done a number onto him, and he was already having a hard time continuing to stand. His head felt like hundreds of needles were stabbing into him, and also, he felt slightly out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But all in all, he was in a much better state than Cheng Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!!”</span></p>

As everyone turned their heads, the streak of light came to a sudden stop right in front of Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yunfei--are you alright?! What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A frantic voice came from within the streak of light before it disappeared, revealing a little bird in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Xiao Qi.</span></p>

I was just comparing notes with somebody else, that’s all.”</span></p>

Chirping respectfully on Bai Yunfei’s shoulder, Xiao Qi spoke to both Wu Hong and Wu Hao, “Xiao Qi pays his respects to Your Majesty and Prince Hao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? This is your contracted soulbeast?” Wu Hong gave an appraising eye to Xiao Qi. “A class seven prisma oriole….how unprecedented, haha. Even your soulbeast is quite special….but why wasn’t he with you before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I….” Bai Yunfei didn’t know to respond at first, but then he saw a small figure come running towards the group from a distance.</span></p>

Xiao Qi! Wait up for me! Why are you flying so fast, I can’t keep up!!”</span></p>

When she realized Wu Hong and the others were here, she came to a screeching halt. Sticking her tongue out, she teetered to her father, “Father, uncle…”</span></p>

Seeing that her father wasn’t angry with her, she turned to obediently walk to where her fourth and first brother were.</span></p>

I’ll allow it.”</span></p>

Saying only a few words more with the man, Bai Yunfei was granted permission to leave and left with Wu Yang leading him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the roads leading out from the Royal Palace, Wu Yang was staring at Bai Yunfei with wide-open eyes. “Instructor Bai,” He spoke at last, “you really are super amazing….Cheng Yao was on the same level as a Soul King almost, and yet you beat him so easily….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew Bai Yunfei was a strong one ever since he defeated instructor Zhou Yu, but then today was the real icing on the cake to prove just how immensely strong Bai Yunfei was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Easily?? It wasn’t that simple…” Bai Yunfei shook his head with a laugh, touching the Charm Bracelet on his hand subconsciously, “I was actually in trouble there….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that battle when the Thundercloud Tempest was nearly upon him, Bai Yunfei found himself at a bit of a loss. He had only protected himself against half of the wind blades coming at him when the protection from the Cataclysmic Seal had failed him. Without being able to resupply the barrier with any more soulforce before it collapsed, Bai Yunfei knew he had to act now and make use of his strongest technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he used the Charm Bracelet to activate his pseudo soul attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He put all his strength into the soul attack so that the Thundercloud Tempest would lose control for just even a little bit. Then in that pause, Bai Yunfei used the Dual Dragon Burst to further break the control Cheng Yao had on the technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doing that had led to Bai Yunfei’s own body practically collapsing from exhaustion though. The ‘coil’ and ‘fusion’ form and then the soul attack had drained a great deal of strength from Bai Yunfei and made his head feel slightly light. If he was at his peak strength, using those three wouldn’t even had done much, but in his current weakened state and the traces of his soul still somewhat damaged, the fatigue the three things had on him was unexpectedly immense….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Yunfei still learned a lot from this battle, and Bai Yunfei felt like the insights he gained from it was great.</span></p>
