 <p>Chapter 119: Only Two Remain</p>
 <p><span style>While Jing Mingfeng was making a fuss over the three soulbeasts around him, Bai Yunfei himself was stuck in a siege from every side…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jing Mingfeng had charged at the Soul Warrior on the left, Bai Yunfei had made a dash for the Soul Warrior with the python. He wasn’t a soul cultivator with a wind affinity, but he wasn’t much slower than Jing Mingfeng. Leaving behind a trail of mirror images, Bai dodged the golden eagle and the snake’s attack as he moved closer to his target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That man was more astute than the Soul Warrior Jing Mingfeng was facing. When he had released the python, he had not ordered it to fly at Bai Yunfei. A low-sounding hiss could be heard from his lips as he flared his soulforce. With a flick of his finger, he gave another order to the python. It immediately sucked in a deep breath, causing its body to expand to the size of the man’s thigh. It then coiled around the man’s body as if it was meant to be used as a meat shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Bai Yunfei could reach the man, the python had completely coiled around the man’s body with enough room for the python to stare at Bai Yunfei. Opening its mouth, a terrible stench could be smelled. It then extended its head to bite down on Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confronted with this ‘blanket’ strike from the python, Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashed with an attentive but calm glint. Tilting his body to the right, his legs pivoted and he swung past the python’s mouth. He then pivoted back to his original position after his maneuver so that he would end up on the left side of the python.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Lifting his right hand, Bai Yunfei’s arm bulged as he slammed his fist into the python’s head!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Threefold Fist Force!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!” Following the muffled sound of a collision, a depression of about an inch appeared in the python’s head. As a result of being struck with such a tremendous amount of force, it flew to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the snake being successfully thrown aside, the Soul Warrior that had been hidden behind it was revealed once more. His mouth was left ajar as he looked at Bai Yunfei in shock. He didn’t expect to see a middle-grade third class Black Python to be knocked aside so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bringing back his right hand, Bai Yunfei prepared to land the final blow on the stunned Soul Warrior when all of a sudden his eyes narrowed together. Kicking off the ground, Bai Yunfei made a hasty retreat while turning to the right to lash out with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he fell back, a giant figure came crashing down toward his head. A pair of golden claws brushed past where his head had been. If he had not moved, his head would have been wiped clean off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after dodging the golden eagle, Bai Yunfei did not relax in the slightest. His body followed his eyes as he turned around just in time to see a bright-colored snake fly out from the grass where his right hand was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From far away, the Soul Sprite’s eyes lit up when he saw the snake come into contact with Bai Yunfei’s arm. With a malevolent smile, he said, “Even if you are a mid-stage&nbsp;Soul Sprite, you won’t be able to stave off death from the poison of a high-grade third class Rainbow Snake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pow!” Right in the middle of his pleased speech, a single popping sound could be heard as the Rainbow Snake was repelled, almost like it had been struck with an iron rod. It hadn’t moved at all during its flight as if it had been struck unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking back at Bai Yunfei, the Soul Sprite could clearly see two puncture holes that went through his clothes. How did Bai Yunfei not get poisoned by the venom of the snake? The reason why Bai Yunfei hadn’t bothered to move his right arm out of the way was the fact that he knew that there was no way for the snake to poison him. The part of his arm he had used to meet the snake head-on was where his Flameblade Bracer was located!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One simply had to ask that one question. How could a third-tier soulbeast bite through the Flameblade Bracer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After knocking the snake aside, Bai Yunfei’s foot stomped against the ground to stop his backward momentum. With a twist of his feet, he shot back toward the Soul Warrior with frightening speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unable to call back his python soulbeast in time, the Soul Warrior had only been able to defend himself against two of Bai Yunfei’s blows before being struck in the temple by a fist. Dazed, the man flew coincidentally to where his python was. Collapsing on top of it, neither python nor man got back up. They were now unable to continue fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barely after defeating that man, a strong gust of wind assaulted Bai Yunfei from behind. Without hesitation, Bai Yunfei bent over from the waist to allow the golden eagle’s claws to streak over his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blood-curling scream could be heard from behind at the same time as well as Jing Mingfeng’s happy laughter. Twisting his head to look back, Bai Yunfei could only see Jing Mingfeng bringing back his right leg. His opponent, the other Soul Warrior, had a footprint on the left side of his face and blood coming from his mouth as he flew through the air. With a plopping sound, the man disappeared under the surface of the nearby lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even ten minutes had past before Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng had taken care of the three Soul Warriors and four Soul Personages! All that was left were the two head Soul Sprites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Mingfeng had been pleased with himself after kicking the Soul Warrior, but his eyes hadn’t relaxed in the slightest. Two gusts of wind had forced him to kick off to the side, but before his leg could even land back on the ground, the gray bat came forward with a loud shriek. Flapping its wings, it flew up a meter. The claws on its feet came out to scratch at the back of Jing Mingfeng’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the claws were coming at his head, Jing Mingfeng’s eyes gave off a bright flash of light. Before he could even stabilize his footing on the ground, his left leg bent down to collect power. With a burst of azure light, he flew into the air with a stunning backflip. His right leg came flying down in a brilliant hook before landing squarely on top of the bat’s head!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slamming to the ground with a furious explosion, the bat’s wings gave a weak shudder before collapsing. The bat was no longer able to continue fighting either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within an instant, another soulbeast had been defeated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten meters away, the tall and short Soul Sprites stood still with ashen expressions. Bai Yunfei’s and Jing Mingfeng’s capabilities had been outside of their expectations. Even disregarding the fact that Bai Yunfei was a mid-stage Soul Sprite, the early-stage&nbsp;Soul Sprite Jing Mingfeng had been so fast that both men were simply stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn! Just who in the world are they!? Without even declaring what affiliation they have, what reason do they have for fighting us!?” The taller man cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shorter man continued to observe Jing Mingfeng as he dodged the blades of wind one after another with narrowed eyes, “Why? Of course it’s for the quickshade bird! A soulbeast that is of the fifth class is something that any ordinary soul cultivator would take the risk for any day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ordinary soul cultivators you say? Do you think they’re ordinary soul cultivators?” The taller Soul Sprite shook his head as he watched the golden eagle miss Bai Yunfei again. He had been concerned about whether or not they could accomplish their initial task. Now they had to worry about whether or not they could deal with the sudden appearance of these two strangers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several meters away, Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng were currently engaged with the fourth class bird in close combat. Or perhaps it was better to say that they were blindly dodging the bird’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, each and every single time they dodged the bird’s attacks, the two of them had unknowingly approached closer and closer…</span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;…………</span></p>
