 <p>Chapter 132: Stay Your Hands!!</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun gently bit her lip. With a resolute look on her face, she slashed at the body of the colorful snake that had shot from the grass on her right. Sparks splashed from where she hit the snake’s body. Although the little snake was struck flying, it clearly wasn’t injured.</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun took advantage of the short moment she had to shoot a glance at aunty Zhao. She had seen that the woman was unable to break through the entrapment of the opponents around her even though she was madly attacking them. She could hear Xiao Bai’s cries, filled with anger and desperation. A trace of despair flashed through Tang Xinyun’s eyes, but it was immediately replaced with a look of unwavering determination. She continued using her sword to defend against the attacks of the black bat while doing her best to slowly move closer to Zhao Mancha.</p>
 <p>She and aunty Zhao had deliberately sped up their footsteps after leaving Bai Yunfei’s group of three within Guyi City. They had reached Gaoyi City in the morning, but they were unexpectedly met with an inexplicable ambush not long after they entered the city. If it were not for Xiao Bai’s vigilance, the two of them most likely would’ve been captured during the initial ambush.</p>
 <p>When the enemies revealed themselves, both Tang Xinyun and Zhao Mancha immediately realized that they were from the Beast Taming School and were after Xiao Bai. With this realization in mind, the both of them immediately fled from Gaoyi City. However, the enemies didn’t give up their pursuit. Their enemies continued to chase after them for a long time as they tried to escape. In the end, they were still intercepted by their enemies in this area, and were forced into a bitter fight.</p>
 <p>The faint groan from Zhao Mancha alarmed Tang Xinyun. Hastily turning around, she saw the monkey let out a screech while Zhao Mancha dodged the attacks coming from underground. Energy an earthly yellow color surged from its body to gather around its right arm. As if soaking in this energy, the monkey's right arm immediately expanded to more than half its usual size while its nails had the densest concentration of orange light around it. Kicking off the ground with its powerful legs, the monkey leapt at Zhao Mancha and swung with its right hand to try and deal a heavy blow onto her waist.</p>
 <p>“Aunty Zhao!!”</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun cried out in alarm as she forced away the large bat in front of her. Just as she was about to run to the older woman, a whirlwind suddenly appeared behind her, catching her off-guard and sweeping her away due to her inattentiveness. Although the whirlwind didn’t have much power, it still lifted her several meters into the air. After that, it threw her heavily against the ground.</p>
 <p>On the other side, aunty Zhao was struck on the waist by the Spirit Monkey, causing her to stagger two steps to the right. She couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood as four deep wounds appeared on the left side of her waist.</p>
 <p>After spitting out a mouthful of blood, a berserk look appeared in her eyes. She rapidly rotated her soulforce and raised her longsword as the orange light was released. Then, she let out a low roar as she turned her blade around to stab it into into the ground beneath her without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>It was the same soul skill&nbsp;that she had previously used against Bai Yunfei in Guyi City. Only, the might of the skill now was several times greater. The ground within a radius of ten meters surrounding her surged upward as dazzling orange lights, that resembled blades, pierced through the ground. The Spirit Monkey had initially wanted to continue pursuing her, but it was struck by one of the orange lights. Blood and flesh immediately blasted out of its shoulders as a bone-deep wound was carved into its body.</p>
 <p>The person from the Beast Taming School had started at the sight of that and begun to exert more of his soulforce. The Spirit Monkey had let out a shrill shriek almost immediately as it dodged the increasing amount of sword-light in an attempt to retreat.</p>
 <p>Within the time taken for several breaths, nearly a hundred flashes of sword-light had pierced through the ground surrounding the older woman. In this exact moment, the ground to her right suddenly began to shake before a faint creaking sound could be heard. A gleam of light suddenly appeared in her eyes before she let out another grunt to hoist the longsword in her hand up. Following her movements, the hundred or so flashes of sword-light surrounding her seemed to have received a command from her to congregate together roughly ten meters above her head, and within the blink of an eye, they formed an enormous sword that was made of a dazzling orange energy.</p>
 <p>In almost the exact instant she raised her longsword, an enormous sword made from the energy had formed. Without any pause whatsoever, she waved her sword and pointed it to her right. When she pointed it at the spot in ground that had made the earlier sound, a “pch” sound was let out, and the enormous energy sword that was originally above her head deeply stabbed into that area.</p>
 <p>“Zhi!!”</p>
 <p>A single screech resonated through the area before a fierce tremor quaked the earth. Soon after, however, not a sound could be heard. The gigantic sword had slowly transformed into separate gleams of light before ultimately disappearing. Zhao Mancha herself could be seen down on a single knee with only her sword to prop her up from the ground as she gasped for air.</p>
 <p>As this happened, the face of the long-faced middle-aged man reddened. He couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood, and he had an incredulous expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Despite being heavily injured, Aunt Zhao had been able to activate her supreme technique to kill one of the soulbeasts. This all happened within roughly ten seconds. As Wu Sen looked at Wu Lin, who was spitting blood, he coldly snorted like he was somewhat dissatisfied. When he looked at aunty Zhao again, he had a trace of anger in his eyes. He waved his right hand, causing the distant Thunderbird to let out a long cry. After dodging one of Xiao Bai’s wind blades, it suddenly turned around and charged at her.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tang Xinyun had collapsed on the ground and had yet to stand back up. When Tang Xinyun saw that the bird was about to launch a dangerous attack against the still-recovering Zhao Mancha, the look on her face immediately changed. She couldn’t help but cry out, “Xiao Bai!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Bai’s thoughts were connected to hers, and it immediately understood her intentions. While responding with a low cry, it swept its wings and charged toward the woman with a speed that wasn’t any inferior to that of the Thunderbird’s.</p>
 <p>On the other side, the gazes of Fang Hao and Tai Ping flashed as they simultaneously reacted. The Whirlwind Bird that had been behind Xiao Bai suddenly stopped, and its wings swept out, causing many wind blades to whistle out. However, they weren’t aimed at Xiao Bai. Instead, they had been aimed at Tang Xinyun, who was trying to get up!!</p>
 <p>The goldfeathered&nbsp;eagle also let out a cry and dove down like a golden shadow. It quickly chased after the wind blades, and its steel-like claws flickered with dense golden light.</p>
 <p>Xiao Bai had only flown a few dozen meters away, and noticed the peculiar situation that was occurring behind it. Without any hesitation at all, Xiao Bai let out a shriek as it immediately gave up rescuing Zhao Mancha. Its soulforce erupted as Xiao Bai’s figure instantly turned back. It managed to fly back to Tang Xinyun’s side in just the nick of time, spreading its wings out to protect her.</p>
 <p>“Plip plip plip…” The sounds of attacks echoed from Xiao Bai’s back, and its white feathers fluttered about. There were even drops of blood mixed with the feathers...</p>
 <p>A flash of golden light had flitted past before a muffled noise was transmitted into Tang Xinyun’s ears. Following that, some fresh blood splattered onto her face. Three deep wounds appeared below Xiao Bai’s left wing and had instantly dyed its feathers red with the blood.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a muffled noise also resonated from Zhao Mancha’s location. Although she managed to dodge the Thunderbird at the last moment, it still managed to scratch her right shoulder and tear off a piece of flesh, causing blood to flow out. Most importantly, her body had been numbed after being scratched by the Thunderbird’s lightning-infused claw, and her movements had immediately grown sluggish as a result.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, right at this critical moment, Wu Sen clenched his teeth as he waved his hand, and a sinister look on his face. A bloody light appeared in the eyes of the spirit monkey, which had already leaped ten meters into the air. It pounced toward the half-kneeling woman!</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun seemed to have been frightened by this sudden turn of events to the extent where she didn’t know what to do. However, her opponents were clearly not in a daze like her. After the whirlwind bird and the goldfeathered eagle injured Xiao Bai, they dove down again without any pause at all, intending to press their advantage with continued attacks. As for the thunderbird, it let out a cry as it once more charged at Xiao Bai, shooting toward it with such lightning-fast speed that it looked like a violet arrow.</p>
 <p>A single moment of carelessness had resulted in the fall into a hopeless situation.</p>
 <p>A cold sneer appeared on the corner of Wu Sen’s mouth. Although he had wasted more energy than he had originally expected to, the current situation was settled. In fact, if it hadn’t been for the for the fact that they couldn’t kill Tang Xinyun, since she had just signed a spirit contract with the quickshade bird, there was no way that Tang Xinyun and Zhao Mancha would’ve been able to last this long. Now, they just had to bring the quickshade bird and the girl back to successfully complete their task. As for the middle-aged woman, they would allow Wu Lin to vent his anger on her since she had killed his earthclaw prawn.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Wu Sen’s expression suddenly turned stiff. The hair on his body stood up like needles, and he reacted as if by instinct. The purple light on his body explosively flashed, and he unhesitatingly pounced to the left, not caring about how pathetic he looked when doing so.</p>
 <p>A fiery-red beam shot over as an explosive roar suddenly echoed within the ears of everyone present.</p>
 <p>“Stay your hands!!”</p>
