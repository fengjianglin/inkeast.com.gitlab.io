 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Like elder Qi, elder Wu’s face darkened at the mention of ‘Crushed Stone River’. She stood up to look at everyone, “Could….could it be a coincidence? Or….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Coincidence?” Elder Qi replied, “Quite a big ‘coincidence’ isn’t it?</span></p>

Why would he ‘disappear’ for such a short amount of time and then ‘appear’ out again then?” Asked Mu Chen.</span></p>

And then being able to sense him again when he left ‘that’ place….that answers the question.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Wu shook his head. “Did the first elder not say that he scanned an entire ten kilometers around the area? If there really was a ‘passageway’, then how would the first elder miss it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai had been listening to everyone talk to one another, but he couldn’t make heads or tails of what was going on. “Elder Mu,” He asked, “What are you all talking about? What is ‘that place’, and what ‘passageway’ are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not Mu Chen who replied, but Mo Yanbai.&nbsp;</span></p>

Please take a rest. Nephew Bai will be fine. The first elder will take you out of Black Cloud Valley in a moment and reconvene you with Bai Yunfei in Crushed Stone River.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai crinkled his eyebrows. This was a secretive talk he was currently listening to, and he was worried about Bai Yunfei still. But if Xiao Qi wasn’t receiving any danger signals from him, there wasn’t much of a need for them to hurry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai hesitated for a moment, but he bowed and left the hall soon after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi and Long Lan both wanted to leave the Underworld School at once, but there wasn’t anyone else that could take them out. Like Zheng Kai, they could only rest and wait for the elders to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the hall, the first elder spoke up after the three had left. “Headmaster, that Crushed Stone River….what exactly is it? I recall that it was just an ordinary mountain river, was it not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It used to be just that before, but now….” Elder Qi shook his head, “It’s become a ‘place of legend’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterwards, elder Wu retold the story and information she had gathered outside to the first elder. &nbsp;Like they planned beforehand, the first elder and elder Wu decided to take the strongest two disciples with them to Crushed Stone River. Zheng Kai and the other two soulbeasts came with them, as they had also the same destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Bai Yunfei’s disappearance and reappearance over to the other side of the Black Cloud Mountain Ranges was far too likely to be relating to the ‘pocket’ they were talking about before, none of the elders saw fit to speculate about any other possible reasons. It surely had to be because of that ‘pocket’, but still, the school had to be sure. In order to clear away any confusion, Mo Yanbai had elder Zhao and elder Mu scour the place again to see if they could find anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Qi was responsible for taking the black-scaled serpent gall Zheng Kai gave him to try and heal the young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Mo Yanbai obviously couldn’t handle every mundane task himself, so he sat in the hall and gave orders to manage everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what in the world did Bai Yunfei come across?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Let us rewind time for just a little bit….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things went like how the first elder said. Bai Yunfei came down to the hole and looked at it. Then without warning, it was as if someone had swung a hammer onto the back of his head! Stumbling forward, Bai Yunfei fell into the hole!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was like if he was a stalk of grass being planted into the ground when he fell into the hole. There was a dizzying sensation for just a moment before Bai Yunfei felt everything clear up. Rotating himself around, he planted his feet onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when he stood up straight and took a look around, Bai Yunfei was startled into silence by what he saw……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The very first thing to tip off his senses was the fact that he shouldn’t be standing on ground. The hole was very deep, and Bai Yunfei was well aware that he wasn’t at the bottom of the hole. He should’ve been standing on nothing but air, but it felt like he was standing on solid ground!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the most important thing was when he looked back up. The sight around him was completely different and unfamiliar to Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding fifty meters of ground was solid stone with all sorts of broken up stones making up the ground. Some were small like eggs, others were as large as a soccer ball. Some were smooth, others were jagged and sharp. Walking on such a ground would be difficult, if not impossible without injury for the common person. But even more importantly, everything was a blur beyond these fifty meters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something akin to a white mist was enveloping the area and turning the air around Bai Yunfei into an undistinguishable blanket that looked like a waterbrush painting. He could just barely make out the sight of a mountain peak and several trees beyond the fifty meters, but he wasn’t sure. Layers upon layers of mist were warping the sight that made everything unclear and mirage-like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t see what was beyond those fifty meters, and neither did he know what this place was, but there was one thing that was clear to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place wasn’t the place he was in before!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stunned almost into inaction by the realization, Bai Yunfei rolled out his soulsense to try and scan the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that was when he realized something else!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soulsense….wasn’t able to penetrate beyond these fifty meters!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like how everything looked very vague, Bai Yunfei’s soulsense felt as though it was entering a swamp as soon as it tried to extend beyond the boundary. His soulsense was unable to take another step, and neither could he sense a thing from the chaotic surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qi…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his shock, Bai Yunfei called out for Xiao Qi. But no sooner did he even attempt that did his face start to pale drastically, for he couldn’t sense Xiao Qi’s aura either!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Poof….” The Fire-tipped Spear appeared into Bai Yunfei’s hand along with the Cataclysmic Seal. His soulforce was already raring to go just in case for battle as he looked cautiously around himself.</span></p>

Why am I suddenly in a strange place like this?” Bai Yunfei grumbled as he tried to find a hint to where he was at.</span></p>

As something of an expert on the Illusion Stones, Bai Yunfei was more than well aware of what the effects of an illusion felt like. He was also wearing a few pieces of equipment that fended off against illusions, and several of them, such as the Charm Bracelet, hadn’t shown any signs that he was in one. So for that reason, Bai Yunfei had to believe this was no illusion.</span></p>

This is some sort of unknown land I was transported to….” Bai Yunfei thought to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those adept in space manipulation or Soul Kings are capable of ‘instantaneous movement’. Moving as fast as the eye could see or even sensing everything in an area, these people could even link one place to another in space.</span></p>

It was capable of exceeding the distance limit of teleportation and bring something from one space to another space.</span></p>

When he first joined the Crafting School, he walked through a mysterious space as red as fire before. That was a very special pocket of the Crafting School.</span></p>
