 <p>Chapter 467: A Change in the Thunderfire Wolf</p>
 <p><em>“A ‘companion lightningseed’, is it?”</em> he smirked, <em>“I shouldn’t have any problems with it, besides not being able to train with a companion fireseed like the Dual Flame Arts talks about. But I’ve a feeling that there won’t be a problem with one elemental overshadowing the other, and that I’ll be able to use a new method.”</em></p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei was first absorbing all of the elemental energy coming out from the wolf, he didn’t bother to fully form an essence lightningseed, and neither did he bother to absorb any other element. Not only was he unable to take in any element other than fire and lightning, Bai Yunfei had a plan.</p>
 <p>He’d form an incomplete essence seed so that it’d form a ‘close’ connection with his elemental fire. If he could have lightning and fire become close with one another, he’d be able to form a companion seed!</p>
 <p>And to his great joy, it succeeded!</p>
 <p>Having a companion lightningseed meant he was able to use elemental lightning. It’d be comparatively weaker to if he had a complete essence lightningseed, but on the other hand….his elemental fire would be imbued with elemental lightning and would grow even stronger!</p>
 <p>On a side note. This also meant he wouldn’t need to have an ‘ammo clip’ for his Lightning Eagle anymore….</p>
 <p><em>“But…”</em> A problem occurred to Bai Yunfei as he thought about the companion lightningseed. Waving his hand, the Cataclysmic Seal appeared in front of him. With another wave, the essence fireseed inside it floated out.</p>
 <p>In normal times, this essence fireseed was placed in the Cataclysmic Seal. Compared to the second one in him, this one was the first one he had, and was much ‘older’. When he failed to form a second fireseed back in the Crafting School, the Cataclysmic Seal was there to absorb all of the elemental fire there. With all the elemental fire, his first essence fireseed grew a lot stronger and bonded quite a bit with the Cataclysmic Seal. After the second fireseed was born, it was weaker. Not so weak that it’d impact him, but there was a very definite gap between the two. Thus, Bai Yunfei decided to keep the second one in his body to help it grow bit by bit and hopefully get the two fireseeds to an equilibrium.</p>
 <p>And now, the second fireseed had absorbed a great deal of elemental lightning from the thunderfire wolf and grew stronger in the process. The more important thing was that he now had a companion lightningseed. But the real question was if it’d impact him in his training of the <em>Dual Flame Arts</em>...</p>
 <p>Breathing out to calm himself down, Bai Yunfei took the floating fireseed into his hand. Slowly, he absorbed it into his chest and allowed it to travel to his origin acupoint.</p>
 <p>He was very careful about this. If something bad were to happen, Bai Yunfei was ready to pull out at a moment’s notice.</p>
 <p>Nothing strange happened at first when the first fireseed met with the second one in his origin acupoint. Carefully nudging the two to grow closer to each other, Bai Yunfei prepared himself to use the <em>Dual Flame Arts</em> and bring the two fireseeds into the ready position.</p>
 <p>As soon as the two fireseeds were about to collide, the companion lightningseed around the second fireseed suddenly began to shine with light, surprising Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>But the <em>Dual Flame Arts</em> was already being activated, much to his greater surprise.</p>
 <p>Already tinged with a touch of purple from its companion lightningseed, the moment when the second fireseed touched the first, the first essence fireseed turned purple in color!</p>
 <p>No. It was better to say that it was given some type of stimulant. The first fireseed immediately started to shine with a purple light slightly weaker than the second, but the more it touched the second fireseed, the brighter the purple light became until it was as bright as the second!</p>
 <p>Previously ‘orbiting’ around the second fireseed, the companion lightningseed started to orbit around both fireseeds now that the two were touching!</p>
 <p>Despite these unexpected happenings, nothing was going wrong with the <em>Dual Flame Arts</em> itself, much to Bai Yunfei’s pleasant surprise. He had only wanted to test out the ‘coil’ form to see if there’d be any danger, but there was none.</p>
 <p>He even tried his ‘Berserk Mode’ for a few seconds, but that was safe as well.</p>
 <p><em>“So the first fireseed had a bit of elemental lightning in it already? I didn’t detect it with before how weak it was….”</em> Muttering to himself as he returned the fireseed to the Cataclysmic Seal. Thinking a while for why that might be, Bai Yunfei was suddenly hit with a thought.&nbsp;<em>“It must be because that flash eagle back in Gaoyi City!”</em></p>
 <p>Back when he first became a Soul Sprite, Bai Yunfei had nearly formed a soul contract with the flash eagle in Gaoyi City. It was strange now that he thought about it, but he could distinctly remember his origin acupoint being touched during that moment, hadn’t it? A spark of elemental lightning had been imbued in his essence firesed during then. So that must’ve been the reason why he was able to form a companion lightningseed so easily.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly like it did.</p>
 <p><em>“Getting stronger as a Soul Exalt is pretty long and hard. Getting use to the recently absorbed elemental fire will take some time to get used to as well. I wonder when I’ll be able to become a mid-stage Soul Exalt.”</em> Sighing, Bai Yunfei folded his arms against his chest.</p>
 <p>His thoughts was interrupted by a soft chirp from Xiao Qi. Tilting his head over to look, Bai Yunfei saw a very concerned Xiao Qi standing on a tree branch. He smiled. Xiao Qi had helped him him so much during the danger with the wolf, so Bai Yunfei was very thankful to him. His feelings of thanks needed no words to be spoken due to their bond.</p>
 <p>Shifting his glance to the wolf a hundred meters away, Bai Yunfei had the wolf come over to him by sending a command through the Beast Taming Ring.</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>The moment when the Beast Taming Ring activated, Bai Yunfei felt something strange. When the ring took his soulforce into the wolf’s mindspace, he felt a little bit of resistance!</p>
 <p>The wolf was already right in front of him by the time Bai Yunfei realized it, so Bai Yunfei had nearly missed the feeling of resistance.</p>
 <p>Yet, it was there, he clearly felt it. There was a ‘fog’ within the wolf’s mindspace that was getting thicker….</p>
 <p><em>“This….this is a late-stage class six?!”</em> The thunderfire wolf was a peak late-stage class six soulbeast normally, but its current strength was definitely lower than before!</p>
 <p>The answer came to him shortly afterwards. When the wolf’s soulgem was on the verge of destruction, it had lost plenty of elemental fire and lightning to Bai Yunfei. So much, in fact, that Bai Yunfei was able to form a companion lightningseed. In other words, the soulgem received enough damage to knock it down a peg in strength.</p>
 <p>Placing his hand back on top of the wolf’s head, Bai Yunfei sent his soulsense into its mindspace to scout out its soulgem. He could sense that the slave seal was no longer there, so there shouldn’t be any danger. Still, Bai Yunfei didn’t want to be careless, so he sent only a sliver of his soulsense into the soulgem.</p>
 <p>From inside, he could sense the insights the wolf had about elemental fire and lightning. He was wanting to get a second attempt at these insights, since his first attempt had been rather busy with all that danger surrounding it. If he could try again, then his attempts to assimilate the absorbed elemental energy would be a lot easier.</p>
 <p>But to his surprise, his soulsense was refused entry into the soulgem!</p>
 <p><em>“It….it has sentience now?!”</em> He exclaimed to himself. The barrier preventing him from entering the soulgem was clearly the result of a defense system of a sentient being. Only in these cases would a soulgem ‘prevent’ any intrusions while it was alive.</p>
 <p>As he debated thinking about pushing more soulsense into the wolf’s mindspace, Bai Yunfei suddenly felt a shock. It started with a shock to his soulsense, but then Bai Yunfei jerked his hand back from the wolf’s head as well!</p>
