 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

The young man he was fighting clearly didn’t care to kill Bai Yunfei by his own hand—as was common in most grudges. He looked a lot calmer than before. If anything, he looked even more determined to kill Bai Yunfei. Bai Yunfei’s couldn’t be postponed, it had to be done now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If left alive, Bai Yunfei would become a tremendous threat to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, even though the black-hooded man was commanding Xue Wei to kill Bai Yunfei, he was looking a little unconfident about that likelihood now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His reinforcements were here, but Bai Yunfei’s reinforcements were there now as well! And three equally powerful ones to boot! One figure in gray, one in blue, and a small bird were now right beside Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?! He’s Bai Yunfei of the Crafting School?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Wei let out a small gasp underneath his breath. He had only now just realized the circumstances of this fight and was quickly realizing the severity of the foreseeable future. “Young master,” He whispered, “We must leave this place at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Half a day ago,” He continued without letting his young charge speak, “the first elder of the Crafting School brought three students with him! We won’t stand a chance if they arrive!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first elder?!”</span></p>

He frowned, eyes blinking rapidly at the implications of that. “Damn! We’re leaving then!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Wei didn’t hesitate to act this time. The space around them rippled slightly as he opened up a tear in the space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man gave one final glance at Bai Yunfei down below, his eyes burning with enough hatred to make anyone shiver. He stepped through the tear right behind Xue Wei while the black-robed elder behind him stared strangely at Long Lan before following through the spatial tear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One second later, the three were well over a kilometer away. A few more tears later, the three were completely gone and out of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Xue Wei was speaking to the black-hooded man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had an uneasy look on his face at the sight of the two other people with the black-hooded man. But he was excited to feel the familiar presence of several people coming towards him. Turning around, he watched as the space behind him opened up to reveal two figures coming through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the two figures was a small prisma oriole. The moment when it came out from the other side of the tear, it flew straight for Bai Yunfei, “Yunfei, are you alright?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Visibly more relaxed than before now, Bai Yunfei smiled. “Yeah, I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who had an aura of blue light was, of course, Long Lan. And the woman in gray robes next to him was elder Wu of the Underworld School.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi was the first to realize Bai Yunfei was out from the pocket due to their bond and rushed over. The other two elders from the Underworld School was a little uneasy when they heard from Xiao Qi that Bai Yunfei was fighting, and combined with their young charges currently in the middle of absorbing the Extreme King Pills, two of the three elders decided to stay behind. The third, elder Wu, took Xiao Qi and Long Lan with her so they could go after Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As fine as Bai Yunfei said he was, Xiao Qi could still tell that Bai Yunfei was practically exhausted of soulforce despite being physically unharmed. His ‘Berserk Mode’ took a heavy toll on his reserves, and his muscles looked like they were close to withering as well with all the fine lines and cracks on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn!! Who was it! Yunfei, who were the people that attacked you?! Xiao Lan, we’re going to devour them!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi was furious right now. He was staring at the three figures off in the distance with a very uncharacteristic aura of murderous intent. To even hear the bird tell Xiao Lan to ‘devour them’ was a testament to how angry he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qi, don’t bother.” Bai Yunfei shook his head. He of all people knew just how terrifying the black-hooded youth was, and the two new people with him were even stronger than he was. To attack them three would be foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who were those people, Bai Yunfei? How did you start fighting them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Wu had a focused stare onto Bai Yunfei. She was secretly surprised about the sight she saw earlier, the maelstrom of black and red energy from Bai Yunfei’s fight. Even at her strongest, she’d be hard pressed to come out with an attack as strong as Bai Yunfei’s—she still had a hard time believing it was him that unleashed the attack in all honesty. Bai Yunfei was a Late-stage Soul Exalt. Him being strong enough to do something like this was unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei shook his head, “I don’t know myself. The young man in black with them sealed his strength somehow and pretended to be a Soul Exalt to get into the pocket. Most of the people inside were massacred by him. Somehow, I managed to come across him, and that’s how…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Elder Wu exclaimed, “Massacred?! Why would he do such a thing?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who knows…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re leaving!” Came Xiao Qi’s cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder in blood-red robes was opening up a spatial tear now for them three to walk through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yunfei!” Xiao Qi cried out again, this time inquiring if they should give chase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Bai Yunfei said nothing. He stared at the three without an emotion to be seen on his face. And not one to wait for something to be done against them, the three walked into the spatial tear and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn!” Xiao Qi cursed as the three disappeared and reappeared farther away. “Xiao Lan, what’s wrong with you?! Aren’t you going to do anything? Are you afraid?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Lan had been stuck steadfastly to his feet from the very beginning. Having not moved a muscle or said a thing, Long Lan looked almost like a statue, which was very strange for someone of his personality. Normally, he would’ve gone after the three individuals as soon as Xiao Qi gave the word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Lan, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei turned to him. Like Xiao Qi, he was also confused by Long Lan’s silence. In fact, Long Lan looked almost ‘terrified’!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shiver traveled up Long Lan’s spine at the questioning of both Xiao Qi and Bai Yunfei. Blinking several times, he turned away from where the black-hooded man and two others disappeared to slowly exhale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Lan, wh—erk!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was in the middle of asking what was wrong again, Bai Yunfei couldn’t help but grunt in pain as the injuries and fatigue from his battle caught up to him. Swaying slightly in the breeze, he sat down and brought his palm to his chest. A small burst of fire came out from his chest before disappearing, and soon after, his power level dropped from an Early-stage Soul King back to a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt.</span></p>
