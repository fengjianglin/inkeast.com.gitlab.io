 <p>Chapter 83: The Changes in the Two Items</p>
 <p>Three consecutive ‘upgrade success’ notifications appeared in his mind, causing Bai Yunfei to be stunned for more than ten seconds. Only then did he suddenly come to his senses and sit up.</p>
 <p>He placed the Firetipped Spear before him, then sent his senses into it.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stared at the Firetipped Spear in his hand, his mind seeming to have exploded. “Middle-grade Legacy! It rose in quality! There were changes in both its secondary effect and attributes…and its upgrade level increased as well!”</p>
 <p>“Eeee? Wait a second…” The stunned Bai Yunfei paused. “+11? It only increased by a single level? But I clearly heard three notifications of ‘upgrade success’. That means…”</p>
 <p>He turned his gaze slightly to look at the crimson bracer. Bai Yunfei gently pressed his left hand atop it, then sent his mind into it.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stared dazedly at the two soul armaments for dozens of seconds, then sat up, closed his eyes, and took two deep breaths. Finally, he calmed down his frantically beating heart.</p>
 <p>“Not only did the quality increase, the upgrade level also increased by one level and two levels respectively…they didn’t fail!” Bai Yunfei gently stroked the two soul armaments, both excited and extremely puzzled. “But…I clearly didn’t issue an upgrade order. Can it be…that it was because I used it to share the burden of elemental fire?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei subconsciously rubbed his chest. Within his chest, there was a ball of fire that was like a heart, slowly pulsing.</p>
 <p>“What a strange feeling. It feels as though my entire body is filled with elemental fire, and I can sense the elemental fire of the surrounding world…” Bai Yunfei raised his left arm, swinging it through the air as though pushing at something, then once more shut his eyes, attuning to his surroundings.</p>
 <p>“The elemental fire in the air feels so incomparably clear to me…and they feel very friendly…eeee? These are…living creatures?” While attuning, Bai Yunfei felt as though he could ‘see’ outside the room. There was a little bird resting atop a tree, and all sorts of other little creatures living in the grass. Or perhaps, more strictly speaking, what he was sensing was their souls. This was the searching technique which only a person who had reached the Soul Sprite level could use; the soulsense.</p>
 <p>“Eh? Someone’s outside? What a familiar feeling…it’s big brother Hong Yin and the others! They…right! This isn’t the time to be researching these things…” Bai Yunfei suddenly realized the most important thing right now. Lifting his head, he stared outside the window. It was already past noon; based on his agreement on that day, the Glacial School members had most likely arrived already…</p>
 <p>By the time Bai Yunfei pushed his door open, he saw that outside the courtyard there were three people. There was Chu Yuhe and Qiu Luliu, looks of anxiety on their faces, and there was also Hong Yin, who was smiling while quietly consoling the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Mm? Yunfei came. See? I told you, he’s fine…” Hong Yin, upon seeing Bai Yunfei walk out, first said a few words to the two women, then turned and nodded towards Bai Yunfei. “Yunfei, just now…you caused quite a stir. Fortunately, you calmed down afterwards; otherwise, I was at the verge of charging inside.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei chuckled towards them. “A small problem occurred during my training earlier, but I’m fine now. Don’t worry; I’m doing perfectly alright now.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yin gave him a weighing gaze. “Yunfei, you actually…reached the Soul Sprite level? What sort of soul skills&nbsp;do you train in…how long can you maintain it for? Right…there’s no time to waste. Hurry up and go; the forces of the Glacial School have already arrived!”</p>
 <p>He still was under the impression that Bai Yunfei had relied on a soul skills to forcibly increase his power for a short period of time. Bai Yunfei didn’t know how to explain, and upon hearing Hong Yin’s words, he lifted an eyebrow. A look flashed through his eyes, and he no longer tried to explain. His hand around his Firetipped Spear clenched. “They arrived? Then we cannot let our ‘guests’ wait too long. Let’s go right now. We can talk after I win!”</p>
 <p>We can talk after I win!</p>
 <p>A sentence filled with confidence. It came from the powerful soulforce roiling in his body, it came from the powerful item in his hand! The current Bai Yunfei was filled with a desire for battle; in fact, he was rather impatient and eager to test his current level of power, as well as test the power of the two items which had inexplicably changed.</p>
 <p>A simple sentence, but it caused Hong Yin and the other two to both feel shocked. They stared as Bai Yunfei strode boldly outwards. A hint of a strange light flashed through Hong Yin’s eyes, then he called out to the two women to hurriedly follow up.</p>
 <p>Time was slowly passing. It was past noon.</p>
 <p>In front of the Green Willow School, just like seven days ago, two groups of people had gathered. However, things weren’t as tense this time, and no swords were drawn. Both sides were fairly calm.</p>
 <p>Zhang Zhenshan was seated atop a willow tree, a cold look on his face. Every so often, he would sweep the courtyard in front of him with a sinister, vicious gaze, like a beast awaiting its prey.</p>
 <p>Beside him was Yu Fei and Liu Cheng, as well as a group of Glacial School disciples. They all stared nervously towards the Green Willow School’s forces, seeming rather impatient. The black-robed man named Yan Xi was also standing to one side without saying a word, arms folded and eyes closed calmly.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Mu, it’s already past noon. Bai Yunfei still isn’t here. What’s this about? Is he afraid of coming out?” Yu Fei raised his head, giving the main gate of the Green Willow School a frowning glance, then spoke out these words impatiently.</p>
 <p>“The agreement was today; no one said it would be exactly at noon. Simply put, your venerable school was unable to control your impatience and so came early. Bai Yunfei is currently preparing; he’ll emerge soon. I’ll have to ask you all to wait a bit longer.” Mu Wanqing gave Yu Fei a glance, then responded to him calmly.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! I know that the little brat is training some sort of soul skills, but for him to not come out…can it be that he’s unable to endure the backlash from it and has died…” Yu Fei let out a cold snort, preparing to say a few words of mockery, but suddenly a look of surprise appeared on his face as he turned to stare towards the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Just as he stopped talking, the nearby Yan Xi let out a soft sound as well, lifting his head to stare behind the Green Willow School’s forces. You Qingfeng, Mu Wanqing, Liu Cheng, and Zhang Zhenshan all revealed looks of surprise as well as they all looked towards the courtyard in the west wing where Bai Yunfei lived.</p>
 <p>“Qingfeng, this is…” Mu Wanqing had a puzzled look on her face for a few moments, then queried the nearby You Qingfeng in a rather uncertain way.</p>
 <p>You Qingfeng frowned slightly. He nodded, then said, “Yes…the ripples of advancing to the Soul Sprite stage, only…it seems rather odd.”</p>
 <p>“Is it Yunfei? Can it be that something went wrong in his soul skills? Should we…” Mu Wanqing’s face changed slightly. She was rather worried.</p>
 <p>“No need. Have you forgotten that Hong Yin is there? And generally speaking, one cannot interfere in this sort of matter. I imagine that a result will come soon…” You Qingfeng shook his head slightly as he whispered in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Yu Fei and the others who stood in front of him were no longer speaking either. They, too, were focusing on sensing that extraordinary elemental energy ripple.</p>
 <p>A long time later, everyone sensed the mishmash ripple of elemental energy vanish, leaving behind just elemental fire. Another period of time later, the elemental fire vanished as well, and all went back to normal.</p>
 <p>“He advanced? How can that be…what sort of soul skill has such a powerful effect…” Yan Xi’s eyes, hidden behind the black robes, revealed a look of surprise as he spoke softly to himself.</p>
 <p>Yu Fei was silent for a long moment, then let out a cold snort. He said to the nearby Zhang Zhenshan, “Even if he was able to temporarily power up to the Soul Sprite level, so what? Elder Zhang, you’ve been at the Soul Sprite level for many years; you are a soul cultivator who is nearly at the mid-stage Soul Sprite level. How can you lose to a Soul Sprite who forcibly uplifted himself to that level? However…if this battle proves difficult, then just do as senior Yan Xi instructed; delay! The backlash caused by this sort of strengthening soul technique will be extremely fierce; by then, he will definitely lose!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he lowered his voice once more. “However…you absolutely must not kill him. Spare his life. After we get what we want from him, you can then kill him!”</p>
 <p>Zhang Zhenshan had a serious look on his face, but the hatred in his eyes hadn’t ebbed at all. In fact, it had grown even stronger. He nodded slightly, still staring unblinkingly at the gates to the Green Willow School, awaiting for the person who had killed his only son to emerge.</p>
 <p>For a time, the entire field had become utterly silent. Everyone’s gaze was focused on the gates to the Green Willow School.</p>
 <p>Moments later…a series of footsteps rang out, followed by a fast-walking figure.</p>
 <p>This person wore gray robes. On his right arm was a crimson bracer, and a similarly crimson spear was clenched tightly in his hands. Waves of heat were swelling outwards from this item. However, it was a bit of an disharmonious picture; aside from his two black interspatial rings, he was actually wearing two other seemingly-decorative rings. On his wrist, he actually wore a bracelet as well in a rather awkward way.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded slightly towards You Qingfeng and Mu Wanqing. Not hesitating or pausing at all, he walked straight towards the empty ground between the two sides, then pointed the Firetipped Spear towards Zhang Zhenshan.</p>
 <p>“Zhang Zhenshan, you want to take revenge for your son, right? Then come out and fight!”</p>
 <p>“I’ve waited a long time for you, brat. I don’t care what methods you’ve prepared; today, you are going to die a miserable death!” Zhang Zhenshan had been stared at Bai Yunfei with utter rage upon seeing him. He let out an enraged roar, then flew out and charged straight towards Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. After we fight, we’ll see who actually wins and who actually loses!” Bai Yunfei let out a cold snort. Saying nothing else, he ran forward at a similarly rapid pace to greet his foe!</p>
 <p>The Firetipped Spear trembled as he filled it with his soulforce. A red light flashed, actually forming a ball of fire in front of the Firetipped Spear. As the flames spun around the spear, he stabbed it straight towards Zhang Zhenshan!</p>
