 <p>Chapter 29: The Green Willow School, Luliu, and Yuhe</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked at Zhang Yang’s corpse in stupefaction. Even though he had taken his revenge, his face was full of grief instead of happiness.</p>
 <p><em>“I’ve taken my revenge... I’ve finally killed Zhang Yang with my own hands! Uncle Wu... did you see that? I've avenged you. Now you and Xiao Yu’er should be able to rest in peace in the netherworld...”</em></p>
 <p>Raising his head, Bai Yunfei looked up at the numerous bright stars in the pitch-black sky through the hole in the roof. He then closed his eyes and took a deep breath before exhaling slowly. Eventually, the complicated feelings in his heart subsided.</p>
 <p>Before he could consider what to do next, suddenly a chill ran down his spine. A feeling of being observed surged into his mind. Moreover, this feeling was vaguely similar to the feeling of when Zhang Yang’s father Zhang Zhenshan had glanced at him.</p>
 <p>“Who?!” Bai Yunfei turned around abruptly and took several steps backwards at the same time. Holding the Fire-tipped Spear in his hands, he stared hard at the door of the hall.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You’re really vigilant, aren’t you? As soon as you calmed down, you noticed my presence.” A lovely laugh came in from outside the door. After that the door was pushed opened slowly and a tall, jade green silhouette appeared before Bai Yunfei’s eyes.</p>
 <p>It was unexpectedly a woman!</p>
 <p>She had waist-length silky hair which swayed slightly as she walked as if it was willow branches dancing in a breeze. Her skin was snow-white, her chin sharp. With a faint smile on the corners of her mouth, she was squinting slightly. It seemed she was engrossing herself in sizing up Bai Yunfei in front of her. Her white clothes were adorned with various jade green patches resembling willow leaves. They were tightened at the waist, revealing her beautiful figure. She was holding a sword about one meter long in her left hand and the scabbard of the sword was also jade green in color.</p>
 <p>The appearance of this woman stupefied Bai Yunfei slightly for a moment, but he reacted immediately. Seeing that she did not seem to have any ill intentions, he gently let out a sigh of relief. Just when he wanted to talk, a lovely shout came from upstairs behind him.</p>
 <p>“Senior sister!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was stupefied again. Before he could turn around to take a look, he heard a clatter of footsteps ring out behind him. Someone was running down the stairs behind him quickly. Then a fragrant rush of wind went past him as a petite young girl ran by him on one side to throw herself into the bosom of that tall woman.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this young girl, the tall woman seemed to let out a sigh or relief. She raised her right hand and patted her back gently while saying in a soft voice: “Thank goodness you’re safe. I was worried to death. I left for just a few days but when I returned I unexpectedly couldn’t find you. Then I discovered that you had been kidnapped by an underground gang in the city so I turned over almost all the local criminal groups to be able to find this place. Luckily you’re okay... Right, did they do anything to you? Were you bullied by them?”</p>
 <p>Only after lying in her bosom for a good while did the young girl lift her head, saying: “No, I wasn’t. They didn’t do anything to me. They said tonight they would give me... give me to their young master. I know you would definitely come to save me so I didn’t do anything either. About half an hour ago, their young master arrived, then, then this person appeared...”</p>
 <p>Her voice was clear and melodious, like that of an oriole, and at the moment there seemed to be a slight sobbing tone in it, so it sounded a bit poignant. At this point, she could not help turning her head around to take a look at Bai Yunfei before turning it back immediately in a timid manner. Then she went and hid behind her senior sister with her head lowered. Her beautiful long hair was covering her face, but it could be noticed that she was quietly glancing at Bai Yunfei in front of her.</p>
 <p>Catching a glimpse of her beauty and her jade-like face, Bai Yunfei was entranced for a moment.</p>
 <p>Seeing the young girl’s expression, that tall girl could not help laughing a bit. She raised her head, smiled at Bai Yunfei then slightly nodded, saying: “I am Qiu Luliu, disciple of the Green Willow School’s headmaster. This is my junior sister Chu Yuhe. May I know which school you are from?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei, however, did not answer her. Instead, he looked outside the house then swept his eyes thoughtfully over the ordinary people who had been knocked unconscious with broken tile fragments by him earlier in the hall.</p>
 <p>The girl called Qiu Luliu had not expected Bai Yunfei not to answer her so she was somewhat annoyed, but upon seeing his movements, she was slightly taken aback for a moment. Then, seeming to have thought of something, she said with a smile again: “Mister, I think we shouldn’t stay here for long. Why don’t we leave first then find another place to talk to each other?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked at Qiu Luliu and Chu Yuhe, who frequently looked at him from behind her senior sister, then lowered his head in silence for a long time before saying with a nod: “Okay, I need to consult with you about some things too... Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Pulling Yuhe, Qiu Luliu walked out of the door. Bai Yunfei took a look at Zhang Yang’s corpse again and let out a sigh whose implied meaning was unknown to even himself. Then he raised his head. The look in his eyes had become clear and resolute again. He quickly walked a circle around the hall, picking up all the daggers he had shot out earlier and Zhang Yang’s luxurious dagger, then turned around and went out of the hall. After he caught up with Qiu Luliu and Chu Yuhe, the three of them gradually disappeared into the night.</p>
 <p>More than ten minutes after their departure, some of the people lying unconscious on the floor of the hall moved slightly then struggled up with caution. Only after confirming that Bai Yunfei and the girls had really left did they finally let out sighs of relief. But then they were somewhat at a loss. Looking at the three corpses on the floor, they were dumbfounded and did not know what they should do.</p>
 <p>“Chief... Chief, we, what should we do now? Should we report to the Zhang mansion right away so that they can send men to capture young master’s killer?” The little man who had been knocked unconscious by Bai Yunfei on the street said to the chief beside him while patting his chest in lingering fear. He did not even dare to look at Zhang Yang’s damaged corpse.</p>
 <p>The chief was staring in a trance at Zhang Yang’s corpse. The color of his face was changing repeatedly, sometimes ashen, sometimes very red and sometimes deadly white. Hearing the little man’s words, he seemed to be woken up with a start. Suddenly his expression looked extremely angry. He turned and sent the little man flying with a palm strike without a warning sign then roared hysterically: “Report? Report my ass!! He’s already dead. How can we go there without getting killed? All of us will be buried with young master!”</p>
 <p>The little man was stunned by his palm strike and was sitting on the floor looking at him in stupefaction. After hearing his roars, he immediately quivered -- he was so frightened that he regained consciousness.</p>
 <p>“Then... then what do we do? Chief...” A subordinate said in a somewhat trembling voice on one side.</p>
 <p>The chief lowered his head and pondered for a long time then raised his head and said to the men around him: “Now that young master was killed in our place, nobody here can hope to escape being held responsible for this. We all know very well how the Zhang family will act. If we are caught, we’ll definitely be killed and buried with young master!”</p>
 <p>After saying so, he looked around and continued: “Wake the other brothers up. We’ll leave Talus City right now. Whatever happens, our lives are the most important thing. Let’s run away as far as possible!”</p>
 <p>... ... ... ...</p>
 <p>In a remote alleyway in the eastern part of the city, Bai Yunfei and the two girls were facing each other, separated by a distance of ten meters. Qiu Luliu smiled at him again, saying: “Just now I already introduced us, but you still haven’t told me which school you are from? Though you’re just a Soul Personage, not only do you have an space ring, you also have many soul armaments. Are you a disciple of the Crafting School?”</p>
 <p>“The Crafting School again...” Bai Yunfei thought to himself, “Zhang Yang also mentioned this school earlier. It seems to be a school good with soul armaments. If that is the case...”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei kept silent for a while then, instead of answering her question, he asked in reply: “Earlier, when did you reach the outside of the door?”</p>
 <p>“Oh? What? You care so much about me peeking at you earlier?” Qiu Luliu was stupefied for a short while then covered her mouth and let out a couple of giggles: “He he, never mind, I only arrived less than three minutes before that. At the time you were somewhat agitated, but when you calmed down, you noticed me right away. Being already so alert at the Soul Personage stage, you’re really quite something.”</p>
 <p>“You... are a Soul Sprite, right?” Bai Yunfei continued to ask.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You can even see this? Not bad, I had a breakthrough to the Soul Sprite stage not long ago.”</p>
 <p>“Though you’re very powerful, you’d better leave this place with your junior sister soon. Perhaps you still don’t know that the man I killed was the the young master of the house of Zhang in Talus City, Zhang Yang. His father Zhang Zhenshan is also a Soul Sprite and even a man of the Glacial School.” After thinking for a while, Bai Yunfei warned: “Just now in that hall, you mentioned your identities. I think by that time some of the men lying on the floor must have woken up. Though I am the killer, if they are caught by the Zhang family, they will reveal your identities, giving you two the same trouble.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Qiu Luliu suppressed her smile and frowned slightly, saying: “What? That man was the young master of the house of Zhang? If so, this will be a bit troublesome indeed...”</p>
