 <p><em>“Success!!”</em> Bai Yunfei felt elation in his heart as he breathed in and out to calm himself. <em>“An increase in spirit recovery! That means… I can recover my soulforce even faster!?”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei impatiently put the ring on while his eyes beamed with light. Closing his eyes, he began to take in the sensation of his soulforce being recovered.</p>
 <p>Ten minutes or so later, Bai Yunfei’s eyes opened up with a pleased smile. Nodding to himself, he said, <em>“What a lucky night this has been! An additional effect like this is just too great!</em></p>
 <p><em>“Then, should I upgrade this other space ring?”</em> After calming down, Bai Yunfei looked at the ring on his left hand with hesitation.</p>
 <p><em>“Forget it, even I know when to stop. Even at +10, it’ll be similar to the other ‘Superior’ space rings. Having an extra space ring is useful anyhow.”</em> Bai Yunfei immediately gave up the notion of upgrading it a moment later.</p>
 <p>After that, he slowly began to tidy everything. Then one item at a time, he stored them all in the newly upgraded +10 space ring. Hong Yin had told him that if a space ring was destroyed, then the spatial structure of the ring would collapse in on itself and all of the items inside would be thrown out. He didn’t wish for the tent to be flooded with equipment in the case that he failed, so he had taken them out before upgrading.</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear was placed in the space ring on his right hand so that it would be easy to access in a fight. The Glacial Pricker was there as well. Putting it there was convenient. Even though putting a space ring on both hands was simply a superficial show, Bai Yunfei didn’t really care to think about that. The space ring on his left hand primarily held his many pieces of equipment. His flying daggers were specifically stored in that ring. He wouldn’t have to swap the Fire-tipped Spear in his right hand to his left in order to take out the daggers in battle if they were in the space ring on his left hand.</p>
 <p><em>“Then that’ll be all for now. I’ve accomplished my goal and unexpectedly profited as well. This night can be said to be my most profitable night yet…”</em> Bai Yunfei sighed in relief. It was almost day time by now and his soulforce consumption had been rather large. There was no need to continue upgrading, so he laid his head onto his pillow and closed his eyes. Bai Yunfei began to sleep, slowly recovering his soulforce…</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Early morning when Bai Yunfei walked out of his tent, he saw that everyone was already up. The day was already in full swing. By the fire nearby, plenty of people could be seen hurrying about their own respective tasks such as preparing breakfast or inspecting the goods.</p>
 <p>Not too far away, Tang Xinyun could be seen sitting on a rock and observing the others do their tasks. Sometimes, she would look to her left with a smile at the inseparable aunty Zhao who was still guarding her. The only difference was that there was yet another gray-robed twenty or so year old youth about 1.7 meters tall. His hair was tied behind his head to reveal a rather ordinary face. At the current moment, he was speaking flattering words to the aunty.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was shocked — this person was Jing Mingfeng.</p>
 <p>His beaten up face had completely healed, but seeing how the aunt didn’t inquire anything about it, it seemed that he had done something in order to appease her. However, this appearance of his was completely different from when Bai Yunfei saw him last. Clearly he had changed into another face that was better ‘suited’ for the situation.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Jing Mingfeng had noticed Bai Yunfei. Smiling apologetically to the aunty, he gave a few words before running off to Bai Yunfei with a trail of dust rising behind him. A smile of expectation could be seen on his face.</p>
 <p>“So, where are my items?” He asked in a rush before he could even get close.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked around before giving him a meaningful look to walk off to the side.</p>
 <p>Walking to a nearby clearing a hundred meters away, Bai Yunfei turned around to stare at the confused Jing Mingfeng, “Is this really your true face?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Jing Mingfeng was confused for a moment before smiling with a puffed-up chest. “Hehe, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei quirked his lips without asking anymore. With a shake of his right hand, he took out a gray scroll and threw it to Jing Mingfeng.</p>
 <p>Catching the scroll, Jing Mingfeng gave it a quick look-over, and then stashed it away into his space ring. With an impatient look, he asked, “What about my stuff?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve changed my mind, I don’t want to trade anymore.” Bai Yunfei declared.</p>
 <p>“You!” Jing Mingfeng was dumbfounded and lost spirit for a moment. However, when he saw Bai Yunfei’s teasing look, he snapped back to attention. He said, “Oy, you’re joking with me!”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I was only joking and wanted to see your reaction.” Bai Yunfei smirked before throwing over several accessories. “One ring to a hand, don’t wear them on the same one!”</p>
 <p>Aside from the two rings and the bracelet, there was also a jadeite sword pendant whose additional effect was also an increase in speed.</p>
 <p>Staring brightly at the four items he had received, Jing Mingfeng quickly put them on. Closing his eyes to feel the power within, he then opened them with a smile on his face. As if he was unsatisfied, his body blurred into motion as he began to run around.</p>
 <p>His speed was so great that any regular person would have only seen a blurry shadow. Running in several circles, he finally ran back to where Bai Yunfei was.</p>
 <p>“Haha!! Great! I can feel that my speed is a third faster than what it was before! If I can adapt to this, then I’ll be even faster!” Jing Mingfeng came to a stop right next to Bai Yunfei with a pleased-as-punch smile on his face. He suddenly gave a strange yelp. He had been preparing to reach out to slap Bai Yunfei on the shoulder, but he felt something different the moment his arm flew out. Quickly bringing back his arm, Jing Mingfeng stared at it in dead shock.</p>
 <p>“This is…” Jing Mingfeng gave a curious glance at the bracelet on his arm. Then, he glanced to Bai Yunfei with a hesitant look.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei smiled and nodded, “The bracelet increases your hand speed.”</p>
 <p>The light in Jing Mingfeng’s eyes grew even brighter as he waved his hand side to side in a series of complicated movements. No longer doubting what Bai Yunfei had said, he stared admirably at the bracelet on his hand with joy.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai, Brother Jing, food’s ready! We’ll be leaving afterward!”</p>
 <p>Tianming called out while waving to Bai Yunfei and and then shouting out a word of greeting to Jing Mingfeng before walking back. Jing Mingfeng couldn’t help but continue to swing his right hand. He watched it move as he walked back with Bai Yunfei to eat breakfast.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Jing Mingfeng, what do you plan on doing now?” While Bai Yunfei was pouring some congee into his bowl, he asked Jing Mingfeng about his future plans.</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Jing Mingfeng didn’t know how to reply for a moment before realizing the question, “Oh, what do I plan to do now? I don’t really have anywhere to go, so I’ll go wherever I want I suppose. Where do you plan on going?”</p>
 <p>“Everyone here is traveling to Guyi City. Miss Xinyun and Aunty Zhao will be hiring a carriage to hurry on from there. Brother Bai and I will continue to travel to my home in Gaoyi City.” Tianming cheerfully answered.</p>
 <p>“I see, then… since I have nothing to do, I might as well go with you to Gaoyi City and see the sights.” Jing Mingfeng answered after some thought.</p>
 <p>“That’s fine with me! When we get to my home, I’ll definitely warmly receive brothers Bai and Jing into it. There’s plenty of fun things to do in Gaoyi City as well.” Tianming laughed as he responded.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had remained silent as he observed the ‘mutual understanding’ of each other with a strange eye, “Since when did these two get so close?”</p>
