 <p>Chapter 258: Craze and the Might of the Cataclysmic Seal!</p>
 <p>The act of self-sacrifice to save the life of another. It was an event that had happened once before in Bai Yunfei’s life.</p>
 <p>If the stream of time were to flow backward, this very scene would repeat itself, but in place of the delicately kind-hearted Tang Xinyun, it was the equally benevolent and friendly uncle Wu that had saved Bai Yunfei…</p>
 <p>The sneer that the black-robed man was almost inaudible, but it somehow roused the previously despondent Bai Yunfei from his despair. With a furious jerk of his head, Bai Yunfei’s eyes were now a bright-red color as they flashed with a near-berserk desire to kill the man.</p>
 <p>“I’ll… I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you alllll!!!”</p>
 <p>A flash of light lit up the Violet Soul Ring on his right hand as the two thousand soulpoints stockpiled in it deposited themselves into Bai Yunfei. As swiftly as they moved into Bai Yunfei, the soulforce quickly manifested itself outside of Bai Yunfei’s body as an intense whirlpool of elemental fire.</p>
 <p>Welcoming the miasmic palm with a barrier made of elemental earth, Bai Yunfei watched as the black-cloaked man’s offense caused a ripple to flow across the barrier with a slight humming sound. Not only did the barrier protect Bai Yunfei, it had also served to rebound the palm strike and sent the man back ten steps!!</p>
 <p><em>“Impossible! How does he still have this much soulforce!?”</em></p>
 <p>This time, the black-robed man was truly shocked. No word nor idea could possibly explain how Bai Yunfei still had soulforce, let alone such a strong amount of it like just then.</p>
 <p>After a successful defensive maneuver, the barrier made from the elemental earth was sucked back into the Cataclysmic Seal. In its place, a flash of red light blazed forth from it. An abundant amount of elemental fire could be seen whirling around Bai Yunfei and the Cataclysmic Seal before even more elemental fire began to condense to be absorbed by the Cataclysmic Seal.</p>
 <p>Unwilling to give his enemy any time to even think about the next step, Bai Yunfei pointed a finger at the man he was glaring at, “Cataclysmic Seal!!”</p>
 <p>Almost as if responding to the indignation in his shout, the Cataclysmic Seal began to hum and vibrate before shooting toward the black-robed man as Bai Yunfei commanded!</p>
 <p>“Hmph! You’re only delaying the inevitable!!”</p>
 <p>Shocked as he was, the man was able to restrain his emotions and keep calm. This soul armament coming at him was unordinary, but at a glance, the man figured that there was no way Bai Yunfei would be able to use it to its true might. It’d be fine if he took the blow head-on, but dodging it would be an absolute cinch.</p>
 <p>But.</p>
 <p>Just as he prepared himself to dodge the soul armament, what happened next caused his eyes to widen before he made a hurried attempt to run away!</p>
 <p>Only a moment had passed from when the Cataclysmic Seal left Bai Yunfei’s side, but in that time, it had grown from its original size to a hundred times as big in just ten meters.</p>
 <p>And it was still growing too!!</p>
 <p>The distance between the two was already a hundred meters or so with an elevation gain of ten meters. From this battle, the intensity of the elemental fire was already enough for the black-robed man to be in a state of panic. Never had he ever seen a soul armament like the one in front of him, and not ever did he think that Bai Yunfei would be in possession of such a terrifying ‘soul skill’ like this…</p>
 <p>Even though the Cataclysmic Seal was expanding in size, it remained half a meter above the ground during its growth. The soul armament felt as if it was some sort of giant mountain, and the black-robed man was an insignificant human that the mountain was sliding down on.</p>
 <p>The man wouldn’t dare come into contact with the Cataclysmic Seal now. Moving left or right to dodge it was impossible as well. All he could really do was try and move back as far as he could while thinking of some sort of way to deal with this technique.</p>
 <p>Only several moments had gone by, but already two hundred meters had been traversed in this fashion. The Cataclysmic Seal wasn’t slowing down in the slightest either. In fact, it looked as if it was speeding up!</p>
 <p>“Not enough!!”</p>
 <p>Focusing heavily on the sight in front of him, Bai Yunfei’s eyes were more and more bloodshot as he thrust his palm outward.</p>
 <p>In a flash of red light, a fireball the size of a ping-pong ball immediately ‘detached’ itself from him.</p>
 <p>Essence fireseed!!</p>
 <p>He… he had somehow removed his essence fireseed from himself!!</p>
 <p>“Go!!”</p>
 <p>Swinging his arm with a furious roar, the essence fireseed was catapulted forward as if it were a shooting star! The speed in which it was traveling at was far faster than the Cataclysmic Seal, so in no time at all, the essence fireseed caught up with the soul armament and was absorbed straight into it!</p>
 <p>“Bzzz!!”</p>
 <p>The resulting sound from the brick sounded both lively and furious in nature. The soul armament tripled in size while doubling in speed with a fire burning several times brighter than before. As a result, the Cataclysmic Seal quickly caught up to the black-robed man before striking at him ruthlessly!</p>
 <p>Absolutely no leeway nor time was given to the man to dodge, and even though he had both of his arms in front of him for protection, they were useless. The Cataclysmic Seal was enormous and he was not. As things were, the man was no bigger than a rat when faced against a giant wall.</p>
 <p>Not only did the Cataclysmic Seal smash into his arms, it smashed into his entire body!!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>There was a muffled sound from the collision, but the Cataclysmic Seal did not slow down in the slightest. Instead, the man was flung into the air. A spray of blood came from his mouth as he dropped back down to the ground as pale as a ghost!</p>
 <p>Instead of going in for an encore, the Cataclysmic Seal rose up into the air above the man.</p>
 <p>Beneath it, the man saw that the area around him had grown dark. Realizing what was above him with a horrified gasp, the man saw that the soul armament had already grown to a length of five hundred meters and a width of two hundred meters with him at its center!</p>
 <p>For a moment, the man could think of nothing.</p>
 <p>Then all semblance of color bled away from his face as he realized what would happen to him. Practically shrieking, he let out a cry after coming to a realization, “No!!”</p>
 <p>His shriek was the catalyst for Bai Yunfei to swish his palm down with a murderous glare!</p>
 <p>“Die!!!!”</p>
 <p>This word had been spoken to Bai Yunfei twice now. Both times the black-robed man had not only said it with such disdain, but he had also failed to kill Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei spoke the word, it was like a declaration of execution for the man!</p>
 <p>Following the downward path of Bai Yunfei’s hand, the Cataclysmic Seal dropped to smash the man!!</p>
 <p>No longer was the man as prideful as he had been before. Only fear and desperation gripped him as he moved his right hand in front of him, summoning an orange shield to protect himself. When he transmitted his soulforce into it, the shield began to glow an even brighter shade of orange as he lifted it up over his head.</p>
 <p>Compared to the Cataclysmic Seal, the shield was no bigger than a fingernail to a hand, but it was his only means of defense…</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the Cataclysmic Seal smashed into the orange shield. If one were to listen closely, there was a faint striking sound from when the two soul armaments struck each other, but that was drowned out from the sudden tremor when the Cataclysmic Seal crashed into the earth itself—</p>
 <p>—and then it disappeared!</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal had buried itself into the ground!</p>
 <p>The world seemed to freeze once more as the Cataclysmic Seal—an object that had previously blotted out the sky—was completely gone from sight! Even the red light that accompanied the Cataclysmic Seal was gone from the sky and instead shining beneath the ground.</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal was not the only thing that had disappeared.</p>
 <p>When the Cataclysmic Seal crashed into the ground, the aura of the black-robed man had disappeared as well!!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>A sparse few seconds passed before the earth trembled once more as the Cataclysmic Seal dislodged itself from the crater and rose into the air. Aside from the dirt and dust on it, nothing else about it had changed in appearance.</p>
 <p>Though at the center of the base mixed in with the dirt, a slight red hue could be seen, albeit barely visible.</p>
 <p>And just like that, a late-stage Soul Ancestor was… dead!!</p>
 <p>Even though the man was dead, the craze in Bai Yunfei’s eyes didn’t subside. They instead traveled to the battle that had already paused a kilometer away. Both the beast tamer and the other black-robed man could be seen standing on top of the violet bird in shock as they stared at the Cataclysmic Seal.</p>
 <p>Pointing his finger, Bai Yunfei immediately commanded the Cataclysmic Seal to fly toward the two!</p>
 <p>“I’ll… I’ll kill you all!!”</p>
