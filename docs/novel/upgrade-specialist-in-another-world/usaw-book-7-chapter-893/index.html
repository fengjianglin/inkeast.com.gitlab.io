 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

He was currently deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Xinyun was also seated in the Core World, though she was on top of a boulder. Every so often, she’d stare at Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi, on the other hand, was outside in the real world to guard the Core Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group split up a while ago. Jing Mingfeng and his great grandfather returned to the city since their investigation was done, and they didn’t wish to incur any more suspicion for now. Bai Yunfei had already his clue and was done for the night. With nothing else to be done, they decided to split apart just in case they were found together and complicate matters for both sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew for a fact that Jing Mingfeng wasn’t only here in Swallow City for the wind immortal grass. He didn’t want to press the issue though; every man had their own matters, and Jing Mingfeng was his sworn brother. If he didn’t want help from Bai Yunfei, then Bai Yunfei wouldn’t push it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew it had to do with the Qin though. The reaction Jing Mingfeng had when Bai Yunfei first mentioned their name had been far too strange. They were also found in the mines—which was under the control of the Qin—and Jing Mingfeng’s grandfather was looking for something. Jing Mingfeng’s ‘business’ in Swallow City definitely had to do with the Qin somehow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The original plan was to go around Swallow City with Tang Xinyun until the auction started in three days. But with Jing Mingfeng giving him the chunk of darkwind meteorite, Bai Yunfei decided that it’d be best to fulfill his end of the bargain. He’d craft Jing Mingfeng his heaven-tier soul armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days was more than enough time for him to craft something.&nbsp;</span></p>

If not, then Bai Yunfei would come to Jing Mingfeng’s inn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And so once Bai Yunfei was back in the city, he began the preparations to craft.</span></p>

Especially when they were allowed to use extremely rare materials to craft an extremely powerful soul armament…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei thought that Tang Xinyun would want to go around the city, but she said she’d rather stay with Bai Yunfei and glean some insights off of him when he started crafting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei muttered to himself as he weighed the object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Mingfeng’s request for him was to craft a dagger. A dagger similar to the ‘Blackwind’ dagger he was using now. The problem was that the size of this meteorite was big enough to craft a large halberd and still have enough room to spare. Crafting a dagger with this ore would mean having a lot of leftovers. Jing Mingfeng did say though that he only cared for the dagger, and that Bai Yunfei was welcome to have the rest of the leftovers afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a pretty good deal to Bai Yunfei. He was determined to try as hard as he could to craft the best soul armament he could for Jing Mingfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This would be the first soul armament he’d craft as a Soul King. Crafters of that level were strong enough to craft low-heaven tier soul armaments if they wanted, but with Bai Yunfei’s strength, he’d be able to craft a mid-heaven tier most likely. Today he’d put that to the test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought hard about the best way to go about this. Waving his right hand, he brought out a pile of materials from his space ring. Aside from the ordinary supplementary materials, most of the materials here could be the main component in most soul armament crafting. He wanted to see which one would be best to work with the darkwind meteorite to improve the soul armament’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t so haphazardly throw a chunk of the meteorite into the cauldron without preparation. The best and most cautious plan would be to split the chunk up into four pieces and make an attempt with just one fragment for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei didn’t think he’d be able to succeed straight away. There was a lot that needed to be done like determining the compatibility between materials. But one or two failures would still be acceptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bubble of fire surrounded the meteorite as he got started. Unleashing a single blade of fire made from his Flameblade Bracer, Bai Yunfei watched as it struck against the meteorite before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But…the meteorite was completely untouched!</span></p>

Just how tough will it get after I temper and refine it…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was amazed by the toughness of the ore. He took out the silver longsword he got from Li Fenghai. Because of its +10 additional effect to inflict nightmares, Bai Yunfei decided to simply just call the weapon ‘Nightmare’. It had an attack power of six thousand and was currently one of his strongest soul armaments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh! Whoosh!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?”</span></p>

He could feel the surrounding energy change a bit, but he couldn’t put his finger on why exactly that was the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?

Because of his failure, his robes were badly singed and covered entirely with dust and ash just like his face.</span></p>

I lost my concentration and it exploded…” Bai Yunfei used the sleeves of his robes to wipe his face clean. He was still seeing stars, so he swung his head to hopefully clear his mind and shake off the rest of the dust. He looked like he had just stepped out from a kiln, and Tang Xinyun looked like she was on the verge of laughing with how ridiculous he looked.</span></p>

This attempt felt far different than to any other attempt before. His previous hardest attempt had been with the boltstones, but even that felt just a tenth as difficult as with the meteorite. Bai Yunfei had no doubts that this material would’ve been impossible for him to even try crafting with if he wasn’t a Soul King. As a Mid-stage Soul King, he was barely able to melt the meteorite to a useable level. The boltstone would’ve long since liquified with how much heat he was putting the meteorite under.</span></p>

His attempts to try and refine the meteorite resulted in the rest of the materials being turn into ashes.</span></p>

Each step of the crafting process was slowly broken down into substeps so he could find the best possible way to improve on the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
