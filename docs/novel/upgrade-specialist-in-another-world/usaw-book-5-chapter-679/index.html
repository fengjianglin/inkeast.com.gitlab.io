 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Red light flowed off from his body and into the surrounding air as he tried to meditate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The very first thing he did after killing Wu Shang was to return home at once. Not even speaking with Tang Xinyun or anyone else when he did, Bai Yunfei shut himself up in his room and began to recuperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It only took a single glance for Tang Xinyun to know Bai Yunfei wasn’t fine. She didn’t ask him about it either. Bai Yunfei might’ve looked fine on the surface, but she knew him. She knew that he was simply faking it. The injuries he had sustained were worrisome to her, but she didn’t want to ‘expose’ him and his lies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when Bai Yunfei was in his own room and had meditated long enough for his breathing to return to normal that Tang Xinyun was reassured and allowed herself to sigh in relief that Bai Yunfei was okay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it were, Bai Yunfei’s wounds weren’t all that serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most egregious of the wounds he had were healed up when he made that breakthrough. He hadn’t been hurt after that, but him canceling out his Berserk Mode meant that he was in a particularly fragile state right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By borrowing on the powers that were the Yun’s Soul Ring and the other upgraded equipment he had, Bai Yunfei was able to replenish his soulforce. Even the debilitated state he was in for using the Berserk Mode was all but almost healed up before the night was over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Bai Yunfei was feeling even better than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because right now, his regular state of being was now at the level of a….peak late-stage Soul Exalt!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The extremely weakened state he was in before due to the battle in Baishan City was completely gone. He was healed well and truly, and even the damage to his soul was gone since his strengthened soulforce at the time had cleared that problem up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another difference in that of his two essence fireseeds. They were back in their original positions split apart from one another. No longer were they in a half-fused state one with one another, though it seemed that the level of friendliness between the two fireseeds were a lot better than before. Bai Yunfei wasn’t even using the Dual Flame Arts to adjust the frequency between the two fireseeds, but the two fireseeds seemed to be getting along without at all looking as if they’d be trying to devour one another, much to Bai Yunfei’s delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moon in the sky slowly waned in place for the sun to overtake it. By the time the first rays of the sun was starting to bear down on the world, Bai Yunfei was only just starting to wake. Exhaling slowly, he stretched his shoulders and popped the muscles in his neck with a satisfying cracking sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled. Never had he ever felt as good as today.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’re you, Xiao Qi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He inclined his head to look at the roof.</span></p>

It was filled with hay and even silk to adorn the place—this was the ‘nest’ Xiao Qi made for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi came down in a flash of light to appear in front of Bai Yunfei, “I feel great, haha! I feel stronger than before! I gained a lot of experience after killing that guy, it took me an entire night to process it. How convenient this is…..with how much I gained, I’m pretty sure I’ll just need a few more times to become a mid-stage class seven.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A few more times….” Bai Yunfei’s lip twitched. “Forget it, I don’t want to always be stuck in these dangerous situations. In any case, are there even enough mid-stage Soul Kings in this world for you to kill for ‘grinding experience’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grinding Experience? What’s that?” Xiao Qi tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah….it’s nothing.” Bai Yunfei waved his hand, “You were injured pretty badly yesterday, are you sure you’re alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m completely fine, don’t worry.” Xiao Qi chirped and flew two quick loops in front of Bai Yunfei to prove it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good then….” Bai Yunfei nodded. He sighed to himself. Compared to himself, Xiao Qi was even more ‘ridiculous’. He hadn’t even the help of any recovery equipment and was hit so many times by Wu Shang yesterday night. As much as he over-exerted himself, once Xiao Qi managed to kill Wu Shang was he enveloped by a strange glow of energy and start to heal. Practically every wound he had was healed within minutes of being in that bubble, and not only were his wounds healed, his strength grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything is because of that +14 additional effect of the ‘egg’. Whatever special effects that egg had, it was super ‘abnormal’....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sighed again. It was unfortunate he’d never be able to know just what that +14 effect was. How had he longed to see the concrete details of the effect—if he had a +14 piece of equipment, just how much stronger would he be??</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he could perhaps strengthen some of these ‘high quality’ equipment to +14…..</span></p>

I have to keep on going and get familiar with the ability to turn ‘failure into success’. Maybe at that time I’ll be able to up the levels of one of my equipment….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

With &nbsp;a shake of his arm, a long set of chains came to view on his hand.</span></p>

No wonder then. Wu Shang being able to ‘replicate’ my Dual Dragon Burst was because of this….” Bai Yunfei muttered, “What a strong soul skill.

There were also a few high quality medicines, but nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>
