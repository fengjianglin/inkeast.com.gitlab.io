The sky was gloomy, and the entire earth was dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s already been two days since everyone went in, why hasn’t anyone come out yet? Is there no Extreme King Pills in there?”</span></p>

He was an elder from the Wood School. From the very beginning, he had been watching the entrances of the portal, but no person of importance had yet to come out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three other elders stood by his side, they were elders from the Metal and the Fire School. There was also a rather tall elder in orange robes. He looked unusually older than the others, but his physique made him seem a great more robust than his peers. It was like his body was brimming with a great deal of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of the elders from the Earth School, a person who came later than the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder if Feng Yan has met up with Lin Zihao and Zhong Liyan yet.” The elder spoke, his voice sounding relatively concerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to be concerned,” Spoke the elder from the Fire School, “we know from the images before that the area inside the pocket is extremely vast. It’ll take time to find one another. We of the Five Elements School will naturally be more willing to form alliances with each other. Very few would try to fight them then. Our chances of getting the Extreme King Pills is very likely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few people had already come out from the pocket, though they were grievously injured from their attempts to get the Extreme King Pills. They were people of relatively low importance and backgrounds, and were people that decided it was in their best interest to give up on the Extreme King Pills. It was from these people that those people waiting outside were able to find out about the situation inside and the massacre taking place. Most of the people had expected something like that though. And neither were they surprised to hear that those from the lesser backgrounds were already ‘washed out’ from the competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?! What’s happening, something’s changing!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other elders followed his finger to stare with raised eyebrows. Off in a distance, it looked as though the space was twisting in on itself as if something was pulling at it. It slowly expanded in size and in intensity before showing a hazy image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a fuse going off, the distortion in the area exploded in size. The surrounding area was devoured by the distortion and soon caught the attention of everyone there.</span></p>

This wasn’t just a distortion of ‘space’, the entire surrounding area was being fed into it!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being Soul Kings, their understanding of spatial energy was deeper than the average person. Realizing at once what was going on, everyone had a pale look on their faces—if the pocket was collapsing, what would that mean for their youngers inside of it?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What every Soul King didn’t expect to see was that after several moments of the distortion expanding, another development would quickly follow it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pop…”</span></p>

In less than two seconds, the distortion was gone from sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sensing something above their heads, they all snapped their heads up to look. Up there several kilometers in the sky, over a hundred people had suddenly appeared out of nowhere!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of these hundred or so people, a small portion of them were trying their best to run away from the area. But a decent portion was still ascending even higher into the sky or using elemental energy to grab hold of a miniature ball of multi-colored light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Absolutely none of the Soul Kings in the area expected for this to happen. Not even a single one of them made a move for a while as their minds raced to keep up with what was going on. They watched as several of the people above their heads try to fight over something. A few of the faster Soul Kings were quick to realize what it was the rest were fighting for and lit up with glee at the sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those are…the Extreme King Pills!!”</span></p>

In a split-second, the entire area was flooded with light as everyone took off into the skies!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the Extreme King Pills were right here in the real world, the Soul Exalts weren’t the only ones fighting for them. The Soul Kings were now here and more than willing to take part in the fight for it!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But…even as fast as the Soul Kings were going to fly up to where the Soul Exalts were, not a single one of them were even close to reaching the cauldron before…&nbsp;</span></p>

Arms made of every type of elemental energy were trying their best to grab hold of the cauldron and hold it tight in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what happened a moment after that would cause everyone to look on in a mixture of horror and panic!</span></p>

Down below, the owners of those dispersed arms shuddered as they felt the force of Lin Dongxiao’s arm and were sent flying back down to the ground with blood pouring out from their mouths!</span></p>
