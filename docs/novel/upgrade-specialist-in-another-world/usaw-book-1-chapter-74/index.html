 <p>Chapter 74: One Against Two</p>
 <p>With a shake of the Fire-tipped Spear, Bai Yunfei attacked Liu Cheng without a warning sign!</p>
 <p>Liu Cheng’s pupils contracted slightly. His eyes flashed with a trace of amazement. He had not expected Bai Yunfei, who just then had still been talking in an indifferent tone, to take the initiative and attack.</p>
 <p>Curling the corners of his mouth showing a hint of disdain, Liu Cheng moved his feet slightly, making a slide obliquely backwards. At the same time, he instructed, “Catch him. Be careful not to kill him.”</p>
 <p>In fact, there was no need for him to say this, because those two men beside him had already got into action. They rushed up simultaneously, one making a grab straight at Bai Yunfei’s right hand, which was holding the spear, and the other throwing a punch towards his heart area.</p>
 <p>Judging from Liu Cheng’s behavior, he unexpectedly did not think getting into action himself was worth doing. Instead, he wanted to let his two subordinates to capture Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes focused. With a twist of his right hand, he turned to the left and at the same time made a horizontal sweep with the Fire-tipped Spear. The man on the left hurriedly put up his arms to ward off the horizontally oncoming spear handle, but he was swept aside by the huge force of impact.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” A dull sound rang out as Bai Yunfei’s back was hit squarely by a punch. However, he only staggered slightly half a step then raised his right foot throwing a kick at the attacker. That man overlapped his hands making a downward block and was also forced back slightly half a step.</p>
 <p>Both of them were mid-stage Soul Warriors!</p>
 <p>The look in Bai Yunfei’s eyes became solemn. Using the Wave Treading Steps, he charged towards the man on the left with a shake of his body and thrust the Fire-tipped Spear out at the opponent’s heart. But as soon as he moved, the man behind him also took a step and went after him closely.</p>
 <p>When the man in front of him had just dodged, Bai Yunfei halted his body a bit abruptly. Then he took intertwined steps with his feet as if tying a knot and after creating two vague afterimages, he unexpectedly stopped while rushing at high speed and turned around to face the other direction!</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear, which had already been withdrawn as he had turned around, was now thrust out fiercely again at the man who was chasing him from behind!</p>
 <p>The expression of that man, who was pursuing and attacking Bai Yunfei, changed greatly. In terror, he turned his body to the left hastily. The Fire-tipped Spear grazed his chest. Before he could rejoice over this, he felt his right waist hit by a large force. It had been hit by a kick from Bai Yunfei. With a painful groan, he was sent flying.</p>
 <p>Just when Bai Yunfei wanted to pursue and attack this man, he heard wind sounds coming from behind. It turned out the other man had made a leap and, with his right foot in front of him, was attacking his head.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei threw a glance and moved his feet a bit. At the same time, he lifted the Fire-tipped Spear up horizontally. This kick hit the spear’s handle, forcing him to took half a step backwards. The opponent’s other foot then kicked out right away towards his heart.</p>
 <p>The muscles of his arms bulging out, he made a push with force. The moment the opponent was pushed away, seeing that it was impossible to attack Bai Yunfei again, he stepped on the spear’s handle again at the last moment and made use of the force of Bai Yunfei’s push to flip backwards.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was also forced to take another step backwards by that final stamp. At the same time, his body shook slightly. Before he could stand firmly, he felt a pain in his right waist. It turned out the man who had been kicked away by him earlier was attacking him again and had just retaliated by hitting him in the waist with a roundhouse kick.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei took two steps obliquely to the left. At the same time, he swung his spear out horizontally, forcing back that man, who wanted to pursue and attack him. But he saw the enemy on the other side charge at him with a dash again.</p>
 <p>Taking a look around, he saw that table, which was full of dishes, happen to be on one side. His eyes flashing, he retreated another two steps instantly then threw a powerful kick. A clatter of dishes was heard as bowls and plates were sent flying everywhere. That large table had been flipped over by his kick and sent flying towards that attacking man on the left.</p>
 <p>That man had already rushed up to a place about four or five meters away from Bai Yunfei. Now that the round table was flying towards him, it was already too late for him to dodge. His pupils contracting slightly, he suddenly pushed his palms out, wanting to shove the table back.</p>
 <p>“Careful!” As soon as his hands came into contact with the table’s surface, he heard a warning from his comrade. Very frightened, he had no time to think carefully and resolutely abandoned his ongoing movement. Exerting the power of his legs fiercely, he stopped his body’s forward charge. When he had just backed off, a soft sound suddenly came out from the round table in front of him. Then a flaming-red spear tip pierced through it, thrusting straight at his chest!</p>
 <p>This man had a terrified expression. He had not expected Bai Yunfei to be so fast that he could still chase up and attack him in a flash after kicking the table away. If not for his comrade’s warning, he would have been hit by the spear!</p>
 <p>Staring that the spear tip that was always at his heels, this man hurriedly retreated. Only when he had moved back more than two meters did the spear tip finally stop.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei rushed up to the round table, which was being held in a vertical position. The Fire-tipped Spear in his hand had pierced through it almost up to the hilt. Without slowing down, he threw another kick at the table, sending it flying forwards at an increased speed. Then he pulled the Fire-tipped Spear back and forced the man who was pursuing him from behind to retreat with a horizontal sweep. At the same time, he used the Wave Treading Steps and chased after that flying table.</p>
 <p>The previous man was retreating nonstop. When he was just about to let out a sigh of relief, he was surprised to see that table flying towards him again. His eyes flashing, he naturally would not ward it off in the same way as before. With a fierce stamp of his feet, his body shot obliquely to one side.</p>
 <p>When he had just dashed out of the area threatened by this table, he saw a flaming-red spear tip yet again!</p>
 <p>His eyes filled with shock, he could only do a flip at the last moment then lay down without hesitating to give up his balance, avoiding this spear strike by a hair’s breadth. However, although he had evaded this spear thrust, he was unable to dodge the follow-up attack!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was extremely fast. Even though his spear thrust had missed, the opponent had also lost his balance. When the spear went past the opponent, he also rushed up to his face and threw a kick at his waist without hesitation. A painful groan was heard and that man was immediately sent flying several meters away violently like a bullet before slamming into a wall with a bang.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei did not continue to chase and attack him because another attack was coming at him from behind. He fell to the left, avoiding this punch, which had been aimed at the back of his head. When he was about to hit the floor, he took continuous steps and moved back rapidly at an angle. When he passed the opponent, his body sprung up. As soon as he stood upright again, the opponent threw another punch at his chest. Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashing, the Fire-tipped Spear disappeared with a movement of his right arm. He unexpectedly did not try to dodge the attack. The moment he took this punch head-on, he also struck a blow with his right fist!</p>
 <p>Ninefold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Two dull sounds rang out almost simultaneously. Bai Yunfei retreated several steps continuously but the opponent was sent flying upside down spouting blood!</p>
 <p>Without pausing, Bai Yunfei gave a cold snort and immediately pursued and attacked him. The opponent had just been dealt a heavy blow. Right after he fell to the floor, before he could take a breath, he saw Bai Yunfei coming at him again. Terrified, he resisted in a carelessly hurried manner. When he was about to be defeated, the other man finally attacked Bai Yunfei again.</p>
 <p>Instead of taking the Fire-tipped Spear out, Bai Yunfei engaged in a dogfight with these two men using his fists and feet.</p>
 <p>Sounds of crashing rang out nonstop. Relying on the Goldsilk Soul Armor’s defense and the Wave Treading Steps’ artfulness, Bai Yunfei seemed to still be able to deal with his two opponents’ joint effort easily. Of course, this also actually had to do with them not daring to mortally injure him.</p>
 <p>He threw a kick, colliding with a kick from the man on the right. Both of them retreated half a step, but the man on Bai Yunfei’s right-hand side grabbed this slight opportunity and threw a punch at the back of his head.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei leaned his body to the right a bit. This punch landed on his left shoulder. He staggered half a step but his right waist was hit again by a roundhouse kick.</p>
 <p>However, the moment he was kicked in the right waist, his eyes flashed with a hint of shrewdness. Making use of the force of this kick, he took a fierce foot stamp and leaped out towards the left. Then he sped up sharply all of a sudden, creating a string of afterimages, rushing straight forwards.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, he was rushing in the direction of Liu Cheng!</p>
 <p>Liu Cheng had been standing there watching the fight all along. As an elder of the Glacial School and a soul cultivator of the mid-stage Soul Sprite level, he disdained to personally deal with this junior of the Soul Warrior level. However, seeing that the combined effort of his two disciples had been unable to take down the opponent for so long, he had already become somewhat impatient. Just when he was considering whether to personally get into action to settle this battle faster, he saw Bai Yunfei charging at him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t overestimate your power! You’re bringing about your own death!” Liu Cheng gave a cold snort in his mind. Even though he was not allowed to kill Bai Yunfei, it was still possible for him to seriously injure him!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was extremely fast. He rushed up to Liu Cheng’s face almost in the blink of an eye. But this meant nothing at all to Liu Cheng. By the time Bai Yunfei closed in on him, he had already raised his right arm. With cold air rotating around his palm, he threw a palm strike at Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Glacial Palm!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Nothing unexpected happened. Bai Yunfei was hit squarely in the chest by this palm strike then was sent flying backwards like a bullet. While in mid-air, he spouted a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>Despite having sent the opponent flying with just a palm strike, Liu Cheng frowned slightly, his eyes flashing with a tinge of doubt. He felt that... the opponent seemed to have taken the blow deliberately?</p>
 <p>As soon as this strange thought emerged in Liu Cheng’s mind, his expression suddenly changed, because he had noticed that the opponent was flying away in the direction of none other than a window of this room!</p>
 <p>By the time Liu Cheng’s expression changed, Bai Yunfei had already been thrown to the side of the window. While in mid-air, he twisted his body all of a sudden and threw a punch at the same time!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Wood chips were scattered around. Bai Yunfei took a forceful step on the edge of the window with his right foot then quickly jumped downstairs.</p>
 <p>“You’ve got some brains, but do you think you escape this way?” Although Liu Cheng was stupefied for a moment by the fact that Bai Yunfei had let himself get seriously injured in exchange for an opportunity to run away, as a Soul Sprite, his reaction was so fast that the moment Bai Yunfei jumped down from the window, he rushed up to it with a shake of his body. Seeing that Bai Yunfei was running like mad on the street after landing, he gave a cold snort and also jumped out of the window to give chase.</p>
 <p>The two men who had fought Bai Yunfei earlier had been quite astounded for a short while as well. They had not expected him to suddenly make this move. Now they began to go after him without hesitation too.</p>
 <p>Clutching his chest with his left hand, Bai Yunfei forcefully suppressed that almost unbearable urge to spout another mouthful of blood as he ran. Although he had planned for a long time and taken the opponent’s palm strike with his highest defense when the defensive effect of the Goldsilk Soul Armor had been activated, how could a palm strike from a middle Soul Sprite have been so easy to withstand? If not for the defense of the armor, perhaps he would have been incapacitated on the spot.</p>
 <p>His internal organs were in severe pain. They seemed to have suffered blunt trauma. Even worse, an ice-cold chill was spreading, making him shiver a bit uncontrollably. He hurriedly took the Fire-tipped Spear out. A sensation of scorching heat spread into his body and eventually canceled out that spreading feeling of coldness.</p>
 <p>Using the Wave Treading Steps almost to the utmost, creating a string of afterimages, he ran forwards at high speed.</p>
 <p>Ten something meters behind him, Liu Cheng was going after him closely at high speed too. The Ice Treading Steps was only suitable for moving in a small area during combat and unsuitable for covering long distances quickly. But even though he was not using a soul skill at the moment, unexpectedly he was still a bit faster than Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>As Liu Cheng looked at Bai Yunfei up ahead, who was becoming nearer and nearer to him, his eyes flashed with a hint of surprise. The fast speed of this body-maneuvering soul skill Bai Yunfei was using was somewhat unexpected to him. Who would have thought that a middle Soul Sprite like himself would have to chase after Bai Yunfei over such a long distance to catch up with him?</p>
 <p>Seeing that they were about to run out of the west city gate, Liu Cheng gave a soft snort. Channeling his soulforce, he took a forceful step and accelerated sharply again with an outburst of soulforce. He then took a leap, which allowed him to go up to Bai Yunfei’s back in an instant, and reached out his right hand to make a grab at the back of his neck.</p>
 <p>“You can’t run, brat. Just give yourself up!!”</p>
