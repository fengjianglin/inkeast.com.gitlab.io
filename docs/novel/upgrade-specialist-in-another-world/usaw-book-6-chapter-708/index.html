 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Under Bai Yunfei's control, he had the 'heat energy' of the Dual Dragon Burst transfer over into the water. &nbsp; And it worked! The water was beginning to boil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei could confirm the blood water around him already less than half than its original darkness. The pressure that had been forcing Bai Yunfei to move at sub-optimal speeds was growing less, and now Bai Yunfei could even send his soulsense to the surface of the water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To which, there was one thing he noticed. &nbsp;The water level was dropping rapidly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Somehow, the Dual Dragon Burst was evaporating a good portion of the lake water!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something as strange as this was actually within the realm of probability to Bai Yunfei's plans, and the Dual Dragon Burst was the key for him to put the plan into motion!! &nbsp;Even an early-stage Soul King wouldn't be able to export as much elemental fire as Bai Yunfei did without expending even more energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boiling point of water was roughly around one hundred degrees Celsius, and that was just in the case of regular water. Special water like this had definitely a much higher boiling point. &nbsp;Someone on the level of a Soul Sprite would probably not be strong enough to withstand the temperature of the waters now. A great ways away, Xiao Qi was still protecting the little girl in the brick's barrier and a secondary bubble of elemental wind, else the little girl would've died a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wuu!!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an unprecedented level of pain and terror in the octopus' wail this time. It was still writhing around in the water with its tentacles flying everywhere as it tried its best to shrug off the extreme heat. &nbsp; Never had it experienced a situation like this before. It didn't even know how to best handle the situation with its level of intelligence other than to try and use its elemental water to try and bring the temperature around it back to manageable levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But without the assistance of its special blood water the octopus was extremely hampered in what it could do. To make matters even worse, the panic it was in was making it even harder to control its elemental water. &nbsp; But with each passing second it couldn't, the temperature of the lake only grew even higher and the water levels even lower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took only another ten seconds before Bai Yunfei felt the pressure on him decrease by practically eighty percent. He smiled when he tilted his head up and saw the water levels significantly lower than before. Looking back to the octopus, Bai Yunfei calmed his soulforce and prepared to start the second round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Pcht....pcht...."</span></p>

Looking up, he noticed then the starry canvas of the night skies above, followed by a kilometer wide surface area of water all around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another loud pop from a little farther away. Bai Yunfei turned his head in time to see a waterfall come pouring down from the night skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Isn't this.....Mount Teapot??"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei remarked. &nbsp; Wasn't this deluge of water coming from the 'spout' of Mount Teapot?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So they were in the back of Formagua City this entire time! The waterfall originating from Mount Teapot was crashing down into the crater of the lake Bai Yunfei was in with a great rumble. From beyond the lake, a series of rivers was flowing into it from different areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei scanned the environment he was in. Now that there wasn't any water to obscure his vision and nothing to stop his soulsense, he could scan the surrounding kilometer. &nbsp; There wasn't anyone, so that meant Bai Yunfei could focus on killing the blood octopus in front of him and then get back to the city to regroup with Zheng Kai and the others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was back in the air now to stand above the lake. Bai Yunfei looked down to the bloody waters, watching as the lake steamed a bloody red to enshroud the nearby area in a bloody mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Xiao Qi."</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Chirp!" Xiao Qi called out in response. Wrapped in a green light, the bird flapped his wings and sent a fearsome gale through the area to sweep around the mist and allowing Bai Yunfei to see everything in the lake without distraction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was practically no water left in the lake. All there was was a 'block' of blood congealed black due to its age. There was also a sea of bony-white fragments at the bottom....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sight of that of course only served to infuriate Bai Yunfei even more. Eyes like daggers, Bai Yunfei glared at the octopus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something happening to the blood octopus he hadn't expected though. &nbsp; The hundreds of tentacles writhing about without energy was within expectations. But that the octopus was bent slightly at the side as if slightly drunk so it couldn't remain upright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a way, it looked kind of like a 'beached fish' that was halfway to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Was it really that effective??" Bai Yunfei was slightly surprised. He hadn't thought that the blood octopus would be this easy to take care of when the blood water was all taken care of. &nbsp; As much of a good thing this was, Bai Yunfei hadn't much room to err still. &nbsp; He raised his right hand to have his palm face the octopus. Transmitting his soulforce to it, he powered up the Ardent Sun Glove and fired off a fireball three-meters large at it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wuu!!" The blood octopus cried out loud. It didn't move, but it lashed out with one large tentacle to try and bash the fireball away from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Booom!!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an ear-deafening explosion as the fireball exploded and reduced the octopus' tentacle to ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"It really is a lot weaker now...." Bai Yunfei murmured after noticing just how weak the soulforce coming from the blood octopus was. "There's still too many tentacles to fight up close though. And with those feelers sucking up soulforce and blood, it's just not worth it. &nbsp;"If a close-combat battle is out of the question, then I'll just bombard it from afar and turn it into fried octopus!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He backed up a bit to prepare for his next move. His hands moved through several hand seals with rapid speed to gather an abundant amount of elemental fire in both arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the looks of it, he was going to use the Dual Dragon Burst again!</span></p>

Its gigantic frame trembled violently as it tried to move away from the area. Glowing orange with light, the blood octopus lashed out with over a dozen tentacles towards Bai Yunfei. There were another hundred tentacles that drilled straight into the ground as if trying to excavate the area. Like drills, they dug at the ground in a way that surprised Bai Yunfei with their efficiency.....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bang!!!!"</span></p>

Airborne, the octopus flew off into the skies to try and slam into Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It's leaping height was tall enough to shoot past even Bai Yunfei and come crashing back down like a mountain with a plethora of thorns!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because he had been priming up the Dual Dragon Burst, Bai Yunfei lost his target for a moment and was immediately besieged by hundreds of tentacles!</span></p>
