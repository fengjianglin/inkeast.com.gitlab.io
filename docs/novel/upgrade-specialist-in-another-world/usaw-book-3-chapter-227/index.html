 <p></p>
 <p>Author note: To shed some more light on this situation, increasing the chance of success when upgrading by 100% means that if the original chance of success was 10%, it’ll be 20% after that.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was overjoyed, <em>“As I thought, this was the biggest change from the Upgrade Technique!!</em></p>
 <p><em>“In that case….”</em> Bai Yunfei thought back to the crafting cauldron in his space ring in preparation to take a look at the stats.</p>
 <p>But then he remembered something crucial;<em> “How could I forget, the cauldron was blown up by me….I’ll have to wait for master to give me another before I can do any more research.</em></p>
 <p><em>“Increase the chance of success by 100%. From a purely numerical point of view, this means that the chance of success for anything is doubled….But there’s no way to find out the exact chance of success to begin with! Ugh. If only I knew the chance of success to begin with; everything would be nice and dandy then….</em></p>
 <p><em>“But what’s even better is the fact that the stone affects the chance of success when crafting too! I wonder if the Crafting School even knows about such a stone, or if they have any….”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was silent as he stored the upgrade stone away. He couldn’t use such a stone so easily.</p>
 <p><em>“Well now….”</em> Bai Yunfei massaged the temples to his head,<em> “There’s still a few things left to worry about….</em></p>
 <p><em>“The Earth, video games, cars, movies, the army….what are these things; are they real? Is there really a world so different to this one?” Bai Yunfei thought. This was a question that hurt his head when he thought about it, and even massaging his temples didn’t quite help.</em></p>
 <p><em>“Are these the memories of someone else?”</em></p>
 <p>The reason why he became a Soul Ancestor wasn’t because of his soulforce. It was in fact because of the planar laws and how they influenced Bai Yunfei’s person. It existed within some part of Bai Yunfei’s mind, so he was able to somehow recall the shattered memories of the transmigrator in him. But these memories shards were so fragmented that they were practically memory dust if anything else. A complete reconstruction was impossible, and Bai Yunfei was completely bewildered by the many things he saw, but couldn’t make sense of. Just thinking about it all made Bai Yunfei feel panicked.</p>
 <p>Within an hour, Bai Yunfei managed to suppress the most chaotic of noise in his mind. Wiping away the sweat on his forehead, he muttered, <em>“It doesn’t matter if it’s fake or not. It’s the same as the Upgrade Technique. They’re both of an otherworldly nature, but whatever the case. I’ve the memories of another person in another world in my head….</em></p>
 <p><em>“There’s a lot I don’t know and a lot more that I don’t understand. But the most important thing is….”</em> Bai Yunfei’s face hardened at this part, <em>“The Upgrade Technique is now in my possession. Was it because of the other person’s memories that my thoughts and actions were influenced to some degree? But if the memories of someone else combined with who I am, doesn’t this mean….”</em></p>
 <p>The very notion that he might not be who ‘he’ was left Bai Yunfei with a dreaded chill and a glint of fear in his eyes….</p>
 <p>It was unknown for just how long Bai Yunfei was left in this state of fear, but when he realized it, he immediately circulated his soulforce to calm himself down. With eyes that were glowing brightly now, he let out a long sigh of air and took in a fresh deep breath of air.</p>
 <p>Closing his eyes, he thought back to all the memories he had of the past nineteen years he had been alive for.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know if it was because of the fact that he became stronger, but some of his previously hazy memories were easier to recall now.</p>
 <p>Bit by bit, everything was forming a clearer picture.</p>
 <p>Even the rare memories of when he was five were coming back to him. His mother’s loving expression imprinted itself onto his mind along with the kindly face of his grandfather.</p>
 <p>Then memories of when he became an orphan at the age of nine surfaced, along with the next nine dreaded years of survival….</p>
 <p><em>“I must live….live with a clear mind and a clear conscience!</em></p>
 <p><em>“There’ll be a day when my little Yunfei will grow up to be like the clouds in the sky. Drifting freely without a care in the world….”</em></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After some time, Bai Yunfei’s eyes flew open. They were no longer hazy with any doubt in them. They were clear and as bright as a twinkling star.</p>
 <p><em>“No matter how real or strange it is, the memories of another person should be nothing more than a very realistic saga in my head….”</em> Raising his fist up to his eyes, Bai Yunfei clenched down hard in a sign of determination. <em>“I’ll accept these memories of yours. But...I’ll never become who you were!</em></p>
 <p><em>“I am me….I am Bai Yunfei!!”</em></p>
 <p>If these memory fragments were placed within the mind of any other person, it might not be enough for a complete takeover of their mind, but it might very well lead to a sudden fear of a loss of identity. Either from a change in personality or nature, either of the two would be a dangerous thing to Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>It was a good thing Bai Yunfei came to this realization sooner rather than later. The dangerous times were over, and he had reconfirmed his self-identity. All he needed was time to sift through the memories and absorb its ‘knowledge’ in hope that it might help supplement his own.</p>
 <p>What Bai Yunfei didn’t know was that this reconfirmation of his identity had inadvertently dissolved a potentially disastrous crisis.</p>
 <p>But now he was currently ‘analyzing’ the strange but fantastical information from the memories.</p>
 <p><em>“What kind of soul armament is this ‘airplane’?! How ridiculous! It’s gigantic and could carry so many people!”</em> Bai Yunfei muttered to himself. <em>“And this ‘television’ could create moving pictures? Wow….”</em></p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p><em>“If only I had just a little more information, I could’ve made this stuff. How great would that be!”</em></p>
 <p>All of the memory fragments in his mind were completely nonlinear and chaotic in information. Some fragments had barely anything, and other fragments were just detailing the random things to how to live a normal life. If anything were to be made sense of out of all this, it surely wouldn’t be accomplished within such a short amount of time.</p>
 <p>He’d need more time than an hour to see through the entire process.</p>
 <p>After a long period of time, Bai Yunfei shook his head to clear his mind free of all the strange things he learned. Recounting everything from start to finish, Bai Yunfei topped off his thoughts with a sigh.</p>
 <p><em>“The profits today were huge, but it’ll take me a long time to fully digest everything. Becoming a Soul Ancestor, the promotion of the Upgrade Technique, a lifebound armament, and all these memories….If I can digest it all, my strength will increase exponentially!</em></p>
 <p><em>“Well….haven’t I accomplished that ‘trial’ anyways? Do I become a tried and true disciple now?!”</em></p>
