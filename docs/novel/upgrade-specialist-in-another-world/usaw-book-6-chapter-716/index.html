 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Shrinking away from the person, the little girl moved to try to open up her spatial bag but to no avail. The bag simply wouldn't open without any soulforce being fed into it. Panicked now, she started to run. Without knowing what to do in this case, Huangfu Rui looked very close to tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha....don't be afraid, I won't hurt you....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huangfu Rui was turning to run at full sprint, a kind and warm voice spoke out to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the person who had just descended from the skies. From the voice, the person could at least be identified to be a middle-aged man. The smile on his face was now noticeable due to the moonlight, and rather than looking scary like Huangfu Rui thought, the man looked more like a doting figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was standing in front of Huangfu Rui now. His fire-red robes could be seen clearly now due to the bright moon shining overhead. He looked to be in his forties around. Built with broad shoulders and a high nature, the man had a rugged, but distinct face and eyes with light as sharp as swords. His hair was sprawled out behind his neck, but overall, the person looked like quite the honest and gentle person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For reasons unknown to her, Huangfu Rui suddenly felt at ease with him around. There was a 'friendly' feeling she was getting from him. A feeling that made him seem very familiar, so it was easy for her to believe in his words. She came to a stop to look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was rewarded with a warm smile as if to comfort her. “Be at ease....those people have been dealt with. They won't hurt you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huangfu Rui turned her head back towards where the others used to be, confused on where they had gone. Her eyes then widened when she realized just what exactly was said by the man. “Did...did uncle beat up and force those bad guys away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Force them away?” The person blinked. &nbsp;“Ah yes, I've already sent them off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled at the piece of the ground where the Hornets used to be. Eyes flicking back, he gave another grin towards Huangfu Rui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was....the head of the Hornets, Boss Hornet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't attack Huangfu Rui with the others or even came out from underneath the same time as the others did. As the strongest, he was responsible for protecting the vanguard. &nbsp;By the time he came out from underground, the others were already attacking Huangfu Rui and then subsequently killed by the mysterious people up above!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn't even know what was going on here. The first thing he saw and felt was the blood and gore from his brethren flying everywhere when he finally made his way up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next thing he did was suppress his soulforce to the max and dive down to the ground, afraid to move even a finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon afterwards, he watched as the one person in the skies walk towards Huangfu Rui before daring to make even a single step off into the opposite direction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 'Hornets of Plum Valley' had experienced nothing but misfortune as of late. The prelude to their tale of woe was Bai Yunfei and the others teaching them a harsh lesson back at Vacancy Inn. Then the next thing to occur was them fleeing to the strange ghost city that was Formagua. It was there that they were attacked by a mysterious soulbeast they couldn't even see and dragged underground. Even with the combined might of them nine, it took them several hours before their final escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two of their numbers didn't make it out with them, and the rest of the brothers had nearly thought they'd die there as well. But for some reason when all hope seemed lost, the tentacles that were attacking them stopped, allowing them to continue on and make their escape. They didn't know why that was happening, but no one really cared either. By finding a tunnel up, they were able to make it above ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What the group didn't expect was to jump out from the frying pan and into the fire. &nbsp;No sooner did they make their long-awaited escape did all but one of their numbers perish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boss Hornet didn't even care to know if Bai Yunfei and his friends died or not now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing he could care about was running away as fast as he possibly could!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did his best to make his way forward for a good while. But then when he felt the pointed gaze of someone land onto his back, the man immediately dropped to the ground. Back and forehead slick with sweat, he had only one thought now. &nbsp;He was definitely dead now....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the feeling lasted for only a moment before it disappeared without him being worse for wear. The Boss Hornet was stupefied, but ecstatic that he was still alive. Renewed with hope, he made his way forward to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man had very clearly seen the man. But the Boss Hornet was just an ant in his opinion, someone not worth chasing after. A mighty soul cultivator wouldn't bother to go out of his way to step on the insignificant ants on the ground. The Boss Hornet was such an ant, and there was no point in stepping on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

He pulled back his hand to say, “Of course you don't recognize me. You weren't even....”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He trailed away with his words to sigh. “Twenty years.....has twenty years really gone by....?
