 <p>Chapter 497: Apprentice of Elder Hai</p>
 <p>The fires from the Dual Dragon Burst burned away at the mountains for a while before Bai Yunfei cancelled out the technique. Waving his hand, he dispelled the remaining fires and watched as the rest of the mountain crumbled. With another wave, the space ring of Xing Qiuhong was brought over to him.</p>
 <p>He took the ring into his hand calmly and then looked to where Xiao Qi was. As of this moment, the bird was curled in on itself as it went through its levelling up mode. Bai Yunfei smiled.</p>
 <p>Xing Qiuhong would’ve succumbed to the Dual Dragon Burst even without Xiao Qi’s assistance. But by landing the killing blow, Xiao Qi had essentially ‘stole’ the experience, an act Bai Yunfei was already familiar with from the bird.</p>
 <p>In the rivers below, the blue-eyes wyrm was just satisfying itself by taking the head of the darkgold boa into its mouth and swallowed it whole. The water in the river surged upwards to surround the wyrm, serving as a barrier for it to digest the energy of the soulgem. From the outside, it looked as if the blue-eyes wyrm was in an ‘egg’ of sorts.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei turned to the left this time, where Yue Feng had been fighting. The elemental energy from that direction was already gone for the most part, since Yue Feng had already killed Zi Mei.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had to admit, he was surprised. He didn’t expect Yue Feng to be that fast in dealing with his opponent.</p>
 <p>Zi Mei was a peak late-stage Soul Exalt, and Yue Feng only a late-stage. It was only a small word that divided the two classifications, but the division in reality for most soul cultivators was far bigger than what a word could possibly define. Even the aid of a late-stage class six soulbeast wouldn’t be enough to make up for this difference.</p>
 <p>Yue Feng was very clearly not like ‘most’ soul cultivators.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t the only one that had an armada of soul armaments and soul skills enough to kill people stronger than him.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei dispelled the ‘coil’ form, feeling as his soulforce started to wash back into him. He stared off towards the direction of Ventia City.</p>
 <p><em>“Now that lord Xing is dead, will the Xing stop sending people after me? They shouldn’t have anyone left.”</em></p>
 <p>That last line struck a chord in Bai Yunfei, <em>“Does that mean I pretty much destroyed an entire family?”</em></p>
 <p>A sigh escaped from his lips, <em>“This is why power is so important. Back then, I had to flee for my life when a Soul Ancestor was strong enough to put me in danger. But now, I can easily kill a peak late-stage Soul Exalt, and his family to boot….”</em></p>
 <p>Yue Feng chose this time to come back to Bai Yunfei. There was a melancholic light in Yue Feng’s eyes, as if there was something weighing him down. He didn’t look hurt from his battle, but nothing other than that. The orange bear on his right shoulder looked slightly depressed as well, but that was more likely due to the amount of soulforce consumption.</p>
 <p>Before he was too close to Bai Yunfei, Yue Feng made sure to hide his sadness and replace it with a smile. When he saw the destroyed mountain peak caused by Bai Yunfei, a hint of shock passed through his eyes. He also looked curiously at Xiao Qi, but turned back to Bai Yunfei to say, “Haha! You’re an amazing one….I never thought that you’d kill Xing Qiuhong faster than I killed Zi Mei.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei smiled back, “You weren’t too far behind.”</p>
 <p>“Come to think of it, I never introduced myself. My name is Yue Feng, whats yours?”</p>
 <p>“Bai Yunfei.”</p>
 <p>“Bai Yunfei?” The name gave pause to Yue Feng for a moment. He had heard this name somewhere, “Bai Yunfei….sounds familiar. Where have I heard it?”</p>
 <p>It came to him in the next second, “I remember! The Crafting School! Bai Yunfei! You’re the disciple of headmaster Zi Jin! My master mentioned you before!”</p>
 <p>“Your Master?” This time, it was Bai Yunfei who looked startled, “And your master was…?”</p>
 <p>“My master is Hai Dongqing, a good friend of senior Zi Jin. You’ve meet him before, I’m sure.”</p>
 <p>“Senior Hai?!” Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows flew to his brows, “You’re senior Hai’s disciple, brother Yue? Haha, what a coincidence to meet you here.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had a pretty good impression of Hai Dongqing. Back when Bai Yunfei and Tang Xinyun returned from the Forest Pass Province, Hai Dongqing and Zi Jin had both been pouring over the game of Go. Unfortunately for Hai Dongqing, he was hopeless at the game, but he wasn’t a bad person in general, and Bai Yunfei liked him a decent amount.</p>
 <p>Hai Dongqing continued to visit the Crafting School for a decent amount of time after that too. It wasn’t until he got Zi Jin to make him a Go board and an amazing soul armament that he finally left.</p>
 <p>There was another thing….Hai Dongqing was one of the five great wandering soul cultivators as well.</p>
 <p>If Yue Feng was Hai Dongqing’s disciple, then him being so strong wasn’t too strange.</p>
 <p>“Yes, what a coincidence it was. I never thought to meet you, though my master has high praise for you….He’s mentioned many times to me that he took on an apprentice far too late, and that his good friend Zi Jin’s apprentice was nearly stronger than he was. That’s why he picked me as his apprentice, though he says that I can’t lose out to the disciple of Zi Jin….</p>
 <p>“But I know now that you are without a doubt a true genius, brother Bai. A mid-stage Soul Exalt at your age and being able to kill a peak late-stage Soul Exalt, words can’t even describe this….”</p>
 <p>“You over flatter me too much, brother Yue. I am only just a product of fate and happenstance.”</p>
 <p>There was a happy trill from Xiao Qi as it finished its levelling up. Bai Yunfei smiled as he turned his head to look at Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>Right now, Xiao Qi’s strength was strong enough to be a late-stage class six almost!</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi hadn’t that feeling before, and Bai Yunfei didn’t think that killing the peak late-stage class six darkgold boa and then peak late-stage Soul Exalt Xing Qiuhong would grant so much experience to the bird! If Xiao Qi continued to grow like this, the bird would be the first to breakthrough out of the three of them!</p>
 <p>Yue Feng’s eyes were wide open with shock, “Brother Bai, your soulbeast….how hasn’t it become a class seven yet….?”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Qi is a special type of soulbeast, being a variant.” He smiled.</p>
 <p>“A variant soulbeast!” A look of envy crossed over Yue Feng’s face, “Wow, the one in a ten thousand kind of variant soulbeast? That’s….”</p>
 <p>“Roar!!”</p>
 <p>An ecstatic roar from the river below interrupted Yue Feng. The ‘egg’ in the river fell apart, revealing the blue-eyes wyrm in it. Its wounds were all completely healed, and its body shined a fresh blue light and along with a tinge of black! Like Xiao Qi, its aura was slightly different now that it was a peak late-stage class six!</p>
 <p>“Uh….that….that….” Yue Feng’s eyes opened wide again, “Brother Bai, this blue-eyes wyrm, why….”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei coughed. “Haha, this one is a variant as well…”</p>
 <p>Yue Feng was speechless.</p>
 <p>“Your contracted soulbeast must be that one?” Yue Feng spoke after a very brief moment of silence. He was pointing at Xiao Qi who was now on Bai Yunfei’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“But then that blue-eyes wyrm must be….” He pointed at the wyrm coming up towards them.</p>
 <p>“Yes. It’s a soulbeast that decided to follow me after I saved it in the Soulbeast Forest. It’s a very smart soulbeast and wanted to follow me for a while.”</p>
 <p>Again, Yue Feng had nothing to say about that.</p>
 <p>The sky was getting dark now, and Bai Yunfei didn’t miss that. “Brother Yue, I will be leaving this place, what about you…?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, I’ll be returning to Ventia City. I’ve some friends there that want to go into the Soulbeast Forest.”</p>
 <p>He looked off to the direction of Ventia City. Yue Feng initially thought that it’d take a lot longer to take his revenge, but now that he was done with it, he figured he could go find Yu Li and Nangong Yuexia.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded with a polite salute, “In that case, I’ll take my leave then. Until we meet again, brother Yue!”</p>
 <p>“Until we meet again!” Yue Feng saluted back.</p>
 <p>And so the two left, to each their separate ways….</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ventia City, in the mansion of the Xing.</p>
 <p>“Ah!!”</p>
 <p>There was a mournful scream that broke the silence of the night. It had been very weak, and barely audible beyond the walls of the compound.</p>
 <p>Right now in this moment, there was a bone-chilling event that was happening to the number one family in the Northern Ridge Province….</p>
