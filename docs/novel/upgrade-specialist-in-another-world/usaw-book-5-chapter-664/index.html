 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Since this person was extremely strong, none of the Desert Wolves dared to treat him with anything but respect. And with such a hefty reward, the Desert Wolves was quick to find Qiu Bailu. All they were told to do was to kidnap a certain person and bring them secretly back to the western outskirts where someone would collect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Bai Yunfei saw no one there to receive them when he got there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one’s here….did they find out their plan was a failure?” Bai Yunfei muttered as he waited at the foot of a mountain. “If….they’re being so careful about this, then there must be a spy of some sort. Maybe….it’s because they saw that Xinyun returned home safe and sound and found out it was a failure. That’s why no one’s here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was the case, then didn’t that mean the clues would end here?!</span></p>

In that case….I’ll take a good luck around this place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei couldn’t give up now that he was so close. Even if he had his doubts now, Bai Yunfei wanted to make sure of everything. If that didn’t work, then he’d try something else.</span></p>

The properties of the richer people in the Capital were all brightly lit with lanterns and such, and just five kilometers away from where Bai Yunfei was, he could see a several villas having their inhabitants celebrate from one place to another with feasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Carefully, Bai Yunfei stared at the celebrating villas, staring from left to right to see who was who.</span></p>

In Bai Yunfei’s mind, finding them within the vicinity would almost prove their guilt in this matter. He just needed to investigate and see if his suspicions were true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

There weren’t many soul cultivators here, and especially not Soul Kings, meaning Bai Yunfei wouldn’t have a very high chance of being found out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Either way, Bai Yunfei made sure to be as careful as he could just in case. As low as the chances are, Bai Yunfei didn’t want to anger and cause trouble with a Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei didn’t notice anything after he scanned half the villas in the area. As luxurious as the events going on in several villas, nothing suspicious was to be had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the positioning of the bright white moon, Bai Yunfei guessed it to be around ten at night now. Flying through the forest, Bai Yunfei soon found himself approaching yet another villa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This one villa was a lot more quiet than the other ones, as if no one was inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bringing Qiu Bailu with him as he investigated each villa was a bit of a hassle, so Bai Yunfei had Qiu Bailu wait in a far away area for him while he and Xiao Qi sped off towards this villa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he approached the corner of the villa, Bai Yunfei extinguished his soulsense and hid himself from sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few seconds later, Bai Yunfei was close enough to look into one of the rooms, where his eyes immediately lit up afterwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cheng Xin, Li Chen, and three others….they’re all here!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cold fury flashed across Bai Yunfei’s eyes. Stepping over the villa walls to land on top of the rooftop, Bai Yunfei headed for where Cheng Xin and the others were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few experts in the villa, but the strongest was only a late-stage Soul Exalt and wasn’t strong enough to sense Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In no time at all, Bai Yunfei was hidden in the top of a nearby tree and away from sight near where Cheng Xin and the others were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hidden in the foliage, Bai Yunfei had his soulsense spread slightly outwards to peer into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Xin, do you….do you think Qiu Bailu and the others are already killed?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

They were looking better than before, though Zeng Fei and Zhu Yizhi still had one of their arms in a sling. Everyone else was looking much better, though it was still clear to see that their arms were to some degree limited in movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone decided on how to deal with Bai Yunfei, they each went back home to prepare a few things like pooling together their primal stones and selling their earth-tier soul armaments. While they did that, Cheng Xin had one of his trusted aides go find an unremarkable gang hire a group of mercenaries to go kidnap ‘Bai Yunfei’s girl’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai didn’t come with Bai Yunfei when he had his lessons today. As it so happened today, Zheng Kai was busy so he didn’t accompany Tang Xinyun and the other two when they went to play today. Grabbing onto this opportunity, Cheng Xin gave the command to have Qiu Bailu and his group do the kidnapping today and bring them back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That afternoon, Cheng Xin and the others waited for the group to come back and bring Tang Xinyun back to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only problem was when they waited until the sun was already setting down the mountains without anyone coming. That was when they received the message: Bai Yunfei’s woman had already returned to the Capital!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That astounded Cheng Xin and the others. Qiu Bailu and his men had actually failed in their task?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterwards, Cheng Xin had someone head over to the Desert Wolves, but their men came back saying the Desert Wolves were nowhere to be found!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was because the Desert Wolves was already completely wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling slightly panicked at that, everyone began to discuss wildly amongst themselves on what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why didn’t we succeed? Wasn’t that Qiu Bailu a late-stage Soul Exalt? He had plenty of early-stage and mid-stage Soul Exalts with him, how could their combined strengths not be enough to deal with those few women? How’d they let them get away?”</span></p>

Didn’t you hear what our men just told us? Those women came back to the Capital without a scratch. That means they didn’t even fight. Did Qiu Bailu and their men not even do anything?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a useless group! ‘One-eyed Mara’? He couldn’t even kidnap a few women! He might as well be dead!” Cheng Xin snapped in anger.</span></p>

There shouldn’t have been anyone strong enough to protect them women. How in the world did Qiu Bailu fail to kidnap the three then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How should I know what happened?” Cheng Xin groused, “Maybe we’re wrong, or maybe something really did happen. All I know is that our plan most likely failed. We’ll have to come up with a new one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Zhu Yizhi looked worried. “But, lord Xin, won’t we get found out if our plan failed? If Bai Yunfei were to come….”</span></p>

There wouldn’t be any clues that’d link them back to us, how would we be found out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Xin is right. Zhu Yizhi, you shouldn’t worry. Do you think Bai Yunfei is from the Fate School and will find us by divining it? Even if he’s suspicious, there’s no proof. What can he do without that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin waved his hand, “Let’s get talking about our next plan then….”</span></p>

His right hand was grabbing onto a tree branch, and the pressure he was exerting was enough to break it off. The look on his face was especially dangerous, and his killing intent was nearly leaking out from his hiding place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he had his proof now, Bai Yunfei had nothing to hesitate about. These people would die today!!</span></p>

Bai Yunfei’s soulforce was already circulating in his body as he prepared himself to attack and kill these people.</span></p>

His right leg snuck back into the tree and in no time at all, Bai Yunfei had taken out the Walk-on Strawhat and dropped it onto his head to hide his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He drew himself deeper in in the tree and remained motionless to further hide his aura.</span></p>

This way, the two of them would be mistaken for the tree rather than people.</span></p>
