 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this light was a permafrost mastiff flying at extreme speeds with Bai Yunfei sitting on its back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment, he was staring hard at the Way Stone in his hand while thinking of the situation at hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The ones who kidnapped Fang Tianmeng are most likely the house of Cao. But….why did they kidnap her? Is it because Cao Jun wants revenge? Why didn’t he come after me then? What’s the point of going after Fang Tianmeng?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it only Cao Jun’s revenge? What if there’s another reason….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those thoughts weighed heavily on Bai Yunfei’s mind. The situation as it seemed, was more complicated than it might look. Right now, he couldn’t possibly think of anything he could do. It was already almost a full day since Fang Tianmeng had been captured. If the enemy was prepared and ready to go after they kidnapped her, they might be back in Baishan City by now. Bai Yunfei couldn’t afford to delay. Every minute he was late meant Fang Tianmeng was closer and closer to extreme peril with every minute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He heard Zheng Kai mention before that Baishan City was only a minor city. The Cao were probably the most powerful in the city with one or two Soul Kings at most. This meant they were the strongest in Baishan City, but outside of that, they were a second-rate city compared to their relative proximity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei wasn’t afraid of a power like that. With his current strength, he had an ace or two up his sleeve. With Xiao Qi, he had at least some semblance of power to fight back. And with the permafrost mastiff, the entire house of Cao wouldn’t be able to completely overwhelm him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he only wanted to guarantee Fang Tianmeng’s safety and bring her back safe and sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of all the students, he was most familiar with Fang Tianmeng. She was a student who originated from one of the commoners. Gentle, smart, and determined despite her upbringing as an orphan, she had been picked up by one of the instructors who saw her talent. She spent the rest of her childhood growing up and training in the academy. In the day, she spent her time working in the academy to pay off her dues to the academy. She had great talent for cultivation and a great training ethic. She wanted to work hard and train so that she could graduate and join the Tianhun School. That much would be more than enough to satisfy her life completely. But now she was in danger….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the past few days, Bai Yunfei had felt one with his role as an ‘instructor’. Though his students had been given to him, he felt responsible for their safety and didn’t want anything to happen to any of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that braindead second generational just wants to make reprisals, then it shouldn’t be too hard to diffuse the situation, but if he dares harm Fang Tianmeng….An icy glint entered Bai Yunfei’s eyes--however much damage Cao Jun inflicted onto Fang Tianmeng would be returned onto him tenfold!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

If the Soul King of the Cao fights, then it’ll be a pain….” Bai Yunfei muttered to himself as he absentmindedly touched at the Soul Sentinel Scarf on his head. After the near-death ambush on him last time, Bai Yunfei had a great deal of acknowledgement for the Soul Sentinel Scarf. With that, he was able to protect himself from the strongest attack of the Soul Kings and was able to launch a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He touched at the Charm Bracelet on his left arm as well. “Good thing I tried out the effects before. Wonder how strong it has to be to protect myself from a Soul King….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking a little more about it, Bai Yunfei checked over the many soul armaments he had. He had a generous amount on him right now, most of them he was more than familiar with how to use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Sentinel Scarf, Cataclysmic Seal, Fire-tipped Spear, Ardent Sun Glove, Critical Glove, Flameblade Bracer, Returner Bracer, Desert Eagles, Cultivation Pendant, Charm Bracelet, bracelet that enhanced elemental fire strength, Violet Soul Ring, Yun’s Soul Ring, and the Flash Lightning Boots….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also the metal-type armor given to him by Wu Yang. He was wearing it right now, so today would be a good time to test it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Touching at the armor, Bai Yunfei watched as the stats appeared in his head.</span></p>

Double the defense meant having over six thousand points worth of defense, that was as good as a mid-heaven tier soul armament. With this, Bai Yunfei had yet another layer of protection in his battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the walls of Baishan City, the guards standing around on the top of the walls were lazing about when one of them bugged his eyes out at something. “Look!” He pointed, “What’s that!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the gaze of his finger, everyone saw a white streak of light travel towards them, causing a disturbance in the forces. It was a tiny speck at first, but within the blink of an eye, it was already nearing them for the soldiers to see a white lion-like animal in side the light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soldiers were only commoners, and the soul cultivators employed there were very weak--many of them Soul Apprentices. The guard captain was a Soul Personage himself and was hardly capable of seeing what was in the white streak of light. But as it drew close, he was finally able to see what it was. “That’s….that’s...that’s a soulbeast!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A terrestrial-type soulbeast that can fly….a class six!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guard captain cried out. With his limited knowledge, he was only able to think about a class six. A class seven was something he had never thought about before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This caught the attention of every soldier there. Soon enough, the walls was like a hornet’s nest before the white streak of light came to a stop overhead. The soldiers looked up to look at the wolf-like soulbeast in dread--on top of this soulbeast was a person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I may ask, where is the house of Cao located in this city?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The question took the soldiers by surprise. The person speaking on top of this soulbeast sounded especially young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blinking several times in surprise, it was the captain guard that spoke. With all the respect he could give under his fear, he replied, “I...this underling….my lord. The house….the house of Cao is located to the northeast in the largest manor of the city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just the fact that there was a class six soulbeast in front of him meant that the person riding on top of it had to be a Soul Exalt at the very least. That was an entity a little guard captain like him could hardly afford to anger. So he could only reply and point his finger in the direction asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei followed his finger and took note of the direction. “Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the stunned eyes of everyone, the permafrost mastiff took off again and disappeared from sight.</span></p>
