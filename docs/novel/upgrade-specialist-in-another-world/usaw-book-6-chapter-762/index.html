 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

They had been glad that Bai Yunfei had been stopped, but just two seconds later when both Bai Yunfei and the praying mantis were at a stop, the fat beast tamer who was controlling the praying mantis realized that something was coming towards the mantis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cried out. His heart rate skyrocketed again when he thought Bai Yunfei was throwing some sort of powerful soul armament as an explosive or something towards him. Those of the Crafting School used soul armaments that were beyond the levels of what normal soul armaments could do, but he realized that the hoop wasn’t going for either him or his other beast tamer friend. It was flying straight for the praying mantis for some reason. As long as he himself was safe, the beast tamer didn’t really care if the hoop was targeting the near-dead praying mantis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then he realized something was off with the incoming ring. True, it was flying with considerable speed, but the amount of energy coming from it was pitiful as if it hadn’t any energy to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he didn’t really understand what was going on,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">something&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">was definitely going on. The fatty sneered and pointed his finger, commanding the praying mantis to cut at the incoming hoop.</span></p>

Right behind Bai Yunfei, one of the rhinos, wolf, and even the large elephant was making another attempt to kill Bai Yunfei. Each soulbeast let loose a loud roar before they charged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the fatty was controlling the mantis, his attack onto Bai Yunfei was a little slower with the second rhino and beetle, but he managed to have the two soulbeasts go in to surround Bai Yunfei anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?”</span></p>

Looking down, he realized that the tail of the orange python from earlier had wrapped around it! Rather than disappearing when it failed to hit him, the python had merely used its tail to sink his leg into place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In one sparse second, the tides of battle were already starting to change with Bai Yunfei being at the receiving half of things!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The looks of joy You Qingfeng had when he was watching Bai Yunfei earlier was already turning back into concern again while the two beast tamers looked pleased at their handiwork.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to them, Bai Yunfei was still as calm as ever almost as if it didn’t even matter if he was a disadvantage or not. Perhaps things were going as he planned, but even when his right leg was caught, Bai Yunfei simply stabbed his Fire-tipped Spear into the ground behind his foot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pcht….”</span></p>

The blast had been so strong that Bai Yunfei’s entire person was thrown a few meters to the left away from his original position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, this meant Bai Yunfei was able to move far away enough to dodge everything since….the only thing wrapping around his leg now was a piece of the snake’s tail!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The explosion from his spear had stabbed into the area where the snake had been, and so the explosion had thus eviscerated it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei didn’t even glance at the portion of the tail wrapped around his leg. His eyes were stuck on the path ahead as he leapt forward, his left hand arcing from left to right as if to cut something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right in front of him, the praying mantis was just waving its remaining hand in a circular motion when Bai Yunfei waved his left hand. As if being controlled, the hoop followed Bai Yunfei’s motions to dodge the blade arm of the praying mantis!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And then after it dodged the blade, the hoop flew to the top of the mantis’ head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as the two touched, Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up with a powerful gleam of light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wrist-sized hoop began to expand in size and circumference. Turning into the size of a wash basin, the hoop then slipped over the mantis’ head and over its neck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not knowing what the hoop was doing, the fat beast tamer looked on in confusion, but it was too late to do anything. The hoop had already tightened around the mantis’ neck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Success!”</span></p>

He was already a good fifty meters ahead from the other soulbeast, meaning he had some time to act. With one swift motion, he pointed his left hand at the fat beast tamer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are yo—agh!!”</span></p>

He was going to say something more, but then a fierce stabbing pain in his head forced him to cut all communication short and clutch at his head before he let loose a pained howl!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s finger was the activation signal for the Charm Bracelet to activate its pseudo-soul attack onto him. It wasn’t a very strong attack, but it was enough to jolt the beast tamer’s mind and cause him to have a look of concentration. And then the resulting scream was because of the sudden lighting up of the ring around the mantis’ neck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Needless to say, this ring was the most prized possession Bai Yunfei had to use against those of the Beast Taming School, the Beast Taming Ring!</span></p>
