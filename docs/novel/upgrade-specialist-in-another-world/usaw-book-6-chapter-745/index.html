 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A brief moment went by without anyone saying a thing. Not even the Soul Kings were commenting on the situation. Everyone was far too shocked to do so as they looked at one another with rising joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a blur as a Soul King from the nearby group of the Hengyang School appeared in front of the area. Reaching a hand out, the Soul King touched at the ripples in front of him with a finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes were on this Soul King, watching as he in turn looked at his right hand as if wanting to know what he was doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was waiting. Watching. Thinking about what would happen when this Soul King’s hand would touch onto the ripples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a flash of light from the Soul King’s eyes before he decided to try and step into it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wave of change flowed across the Soul King’s expression the moment his foot drew across. So furious that several nearby people could feel his killing intent, the Soul King unleashed an aura that dropped the temperature of the surrounding area by several degrees. Some of the other Soul Kings who were prepared to move in as well ceased their movements to watch as his foot slowly drew back down to its original spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone then watched as the elder slowly drew back from the invisible ‘door in front of him and retreat as if he had been shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of ripples reverberated through the air at the same time he moved back, trembling as if reacting badly to something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Realizing what this meant, every single Soul King blanched and shot the Soul King from the Hengyang School a displeased warning glare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having felt a little unwell already from what he had just done, the Soul King frowned when he felt the gazes of everyone else. He knew that what he did had earned him the ire of everyone there, but as only an Early-stage Soul King, he hadn’t the right to be so ‘brash’ in front of them all. As if trying to make up for his loss of composure and foolish action, he drew back away from the area. “Everybody! This old man has verified that the entrance to the pocket has...already been opened!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bzzzz…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was sent into a flurry at what he said. All of the Soul Exalts there gave surprised looks at one another and then at the rippling area in front of them. Chatting to one another, they all looked excited for what that meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha!! At last the pocket’s open! Move aside, I’m going to be the one to go in first!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud voice cried out from a group from the left. A single person came shooting out then to fly straight for the mountain where the pocket was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Lin Dongxiao from the Beast Taming School!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked a little pensive when someone from the Beast Taming School came. While it wasn’t accurate to say they were afraid of them, most of the people there were still slightly peevish at the idea of going against the powerhouse that was their school. Several of the prodigies stayed behind with their group to allow Lin Dongxiao to go in first, and even those from the Ten Schools stayed behind, but only due to their less competitive streak and silent agreement with one another to see what would happen. Wang Kunpeng and Li Yuchun from the Wang and Li both just gave Lin Dongxiao a sneer when he passed by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder from the Beast Taming School didn’t seem to look inclined in stopping Lin Dongxiao from acting as arrogant as he was. He merely just stared at the entrance of the pocket with a faint trembling of the lip as if speaking to his other students about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the other groups started to set out. Lin Dongxiao was at the front of the group with his three other students to head into the pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! I’ll be going in first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Laughing merrily, Lin Dongxiao and his three fellow beast tamers disappeared from sight while the elder from the Beast Taming School came to a stop half a kilometer away from the pocket to stare at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the students from the Beast Taming School were gone, everyone was now free to do as they pleased. The nearest group—the Hengyang School—took the initiative to have their two students go charging in after getting the approval from their elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bzz….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before they could go in, yet another development happened and caused everyone to look on in shock!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if something had prompted its activation, the surrounding hundred meters of the pocket started to show a series of rippling waves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if the entire pocket was starting to grow agitated by something. The space inside the pocket was twisting in on itself and misting over as if being blocked by a fog of some kind. The scenery was starting to look nearly like a mirage with how unreal it looked, but everyone could still see a scenery of some kind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mountain, a forest, and some sort of river of water with crushed stones all around it were mixing together to form one whole piece of scenery. No one knew what was going on, but there was something about this scenery that immediately caught the attention of everyone there….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the foggy and illusion-like scenery and just five hundred meters above the mountain, there was a small grove of stone forests. In one of the stone trees was a single large furnace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This furnace looked especially old and red in color. It had a dark glow to its surface and looked a little ordinary even. At a glance, this looked just like any other furnace or stove with several decorative markings running all over it. No one knew if it was just the distortion in the air or not, but a few ‘wisps’ of something was rising out from the furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable ‘smell’ started to disseminate through the air, penetrating the seemingly illusionary scenery right in front of everyone’s eyes. From the smell, everyone could immediately sense a fantastical ‘aroma’....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment when the furnace appeared, everyone could instantaneously place their finger onto what this ‘aroma’ was. The eyes of all the Soul Kings were all shining bright with shock and joy, and the elder of the Beast Taming School couldn’t help but exclaim out loud, “The Extreme King Pill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was….the Extreme King Pill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from the Beast Taming School, no one else had really seen what this ‘furnace’ full of Extreme King Pills meant. Most of the factions there didn’t even believe in the rumors of how many there were, but now that they were greeted with this sight, every single Soul King were already telling their Soul Exalts to head into the pocket to fight for the Extreme King Pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The illusionary landscaped started to change shape a second later. Everyone looked at it again, curious on what it would show next.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a single person running quickly through the area. A closer look would reveal this person to be Lin Dongxiao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was by himself. Though he had gone into the pocket with three others, none of the three were to be seen at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the most important thing was that he was running in the complete opposite direction of the Extreme King Pills’ location!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had a strange look on their faces at that, though most of them were quite pleased to see it. The elder of the Beast Taming School on the other hand, looked as though he had swallowed something rotten….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The pocket has opened, this must be showing what’s going on inside the pocket being shown over the fabric of reality outside of it! We should be able to see what’s going on for now, but who knows for how much longer? Peng’er, hurry on in and remember where the Extreme King Pills’ are located! And be sure to be careful, don’t let your greed overshadow everything else!”</span></p>
