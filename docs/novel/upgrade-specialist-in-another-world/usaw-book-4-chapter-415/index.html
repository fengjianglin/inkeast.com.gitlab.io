 <p>Chapter 415: Reaching the 'Limits' in One Month?</p>
 <p>A change had overcome Xiao Qi ever since it killed the greenwood wolf. The change was so big, it was almost as if the bird was born again, but if the biggest change had to be said, it’d be that the bird loved to battle now.</p>
 <p>Before, the bird loathed taking part in battles, but now it was fighting with even more vigor than than the blue-eyes wyrm.</p>
 <p>Taking flight to any opponent Bai Yunfei fought against, Xiao Qi fought as if fighting was the only way it could vent its feelings; sometimes, the attacks it used were so widespread that even Bai Yunfei had to leap out of the way to avoid.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi’s rate of improvement grew more and more astonishing with each passing day. From each battle, Bai Yunfei could note that Xiao Qi’s actual strength was beyond what a mid-stage class five soulbeast should be capable of.</p>
 <p>In truth, it was fighting at the standards of a late-stage class five, and that was without taking into account of Xiao Qi’s usage of the Spatial Edge.</p>
 <p>In another battle, Xiao Qi had used the Spatial Edge to kill yet another early-stage class six greenwood wolf. While not as impressive since the blue-eyes wyrm had been distracting it, the attack had still been a one-hit kill on the wolf, much to Bai Yunfei’s surprise.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi rarely used the Spatial Edge to fight, but it was doing so in this battle almost freely. Clearly, the hatred left behind by the killer of Xiao Qi’s mother had been strong enough for Xiao Qi to take it out on the wolf’s entire race.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t want Xiao Qi to be completely overwhelmed by its emotions, but he knew that the bird needed some time by itself to readjust and recover from the emotional ordeal it went through recently.</p>
 <p>He did however, give words of comfort and motivation to Xiao Qi, which seemed to have taken a very apparent and positive effect on the bird. The day it killed the wolf, Xiao Qi was sullen beyond belief, but it slowly recovered its usual vibrancy over the course of the days after that, showing a strong mental growth. But from time to time, Bai Yunfei would be able to see a pondering light in the bird’s eyes, though he never asked the bird about it.</p>
 <p>All in all, the past month passed by without much trouble. Having spent every day training, Bai Yunfei estimated his strength would soon be back at the limits of a late-stage Soul Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Rather than his strength being the unexpected one, it was Xiao Qi’s strength that was the most surprising. After killing a second early-stage class six greenwood wolf and eating its soulgem, there was yet another substantial boost in strength.</p>
 <p>From Bai Yunfei’s observations, Xiao Qi was already half of the way there to becoming a late-stage class five!</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Yunfei had some evidence to back up his previous guesses.</p>
 <p>Each time Xiao Qi killed, there was a strange energy that’d appear and increase its strength rapidly.</p>
 <p>For the following time after that discovery, Xiao Qi killed several dozen soulbeasts. And by the time one month was up, Xiao Qi was already standing at the peak of what a late-stage class five soulbeast could attain!</p>
 <p>In other words, it was the same level of strength as Bai Yunfei now!</p>
 <p>Only two months passed since Xiao Qi was born, and yet it was a late-stage class five soulbeast ready to breakthrough!</p>
 <p>While not completely unique in the world of soulbeasts, only a few soulbeasts had a level of talent this great.</p>
 <p>Some of the soulbeasts were naturally born at the class four or five level, whether this may be due to their bloodline, or an inheritance of sort.</p>
 <p>Having either of the two factor in their strength was where soulbeasts shined over soul cultivators.</p>
 <p>But the most important thing was that Xiao Qi was a….prisma oriole! An ‘inferior’ soulbeast that required many dozen years in order to become a class five soulbeast!</p>
 <p>And yet, the length of time it took Xiao Qi to do the same would’ve sent waves throughout the entire soul cultivator world if they heard about it!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was no stranger to how strange it was with improving so rapidly, though. Xiao Qi had already given him plenty of surprises, so its rate of improvement only felt ‘right’ to him and was quite the joy for him.</p>
 <p>There was some concern from Bai Yunfei when Xiao Qi’s strength was stalled at the very edge of the late-stage class five level.</p>
 <p>Prisma orioles were known to only be able to grow to a late-stage class five soulbeast. In other words, their potential reached only so far. If that was true, it didn’t matter how fast Xiao Qi improved if it would plateau in strength from there.</p>
 <p>But it was a little too early to say a thing. Xiao Qi had only just reached the limit, so Bai Yunfei could only watch anxiously for the results.</p>
 <p>After all, Xiao Qi had long surpassed what he expected from an ordinary ‘prisma oriole’. What future achievements Xiao Qi might have, Bai Yunfei was sure he’d be very excite to see them.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Alright, Xiao Lan. Stop in front of that hill and take a break.”</p>
 <p>The sun was already nearing the highest point in the skies. Having noticed this, Bai Yunfei pointed the wyrm over to the side for it to stop by the several dozen meter tall hill for the day.</p>
 <p>Somewhat in a good mood today, Xiao Qi chirped once first before flying forwards. Circling twice around the hill, it came down to a tree and chirped several times at Bai Yunfei to say that the place was safe to camp in.</p>
 <p>Nearing the bottom of the hill, Bai Yunfei patted the top of the wyrm’s head, “Shrink yourself a little, Xiao Lan. You’re a little too noticeable right now.”</p>
 <p>He dismounted from the wyrm first, allowing the wyrm to freely start to glow in light. Continuing to shrink in size, the wyrm continued to grow smaller and smaller before reaching a height that was barely at Bai Yunfei’s waist.</p>
 <p>In the end, it was roughly a hundred times smaller than what it was before.</p>
 <p>A disproportionately large head, small claws, long tail, and eyes that were noticeably large.</p>
 <p>Even though it had shrunk proportionally in size, the previously fearsome blue-eyes wyrm was now looking a great deal more ‘cuter’, looking similar to a chibi plush toy, in fact….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded in satisfaction at the new size of the wyrm. He scratched its head in reward before turning towards the hill. A look of helplessness was still in the wyrm’s eyes, but it followed Bai Yunfei with its tail slowly wagging behind.</p>
 <p>The trees in this area were far more sparse in numbers, and the top of the hill was high enough to poke up above from the rest of the trees below, revealing a blanket of green that expanded for miles on end.</p>
 <p>Thanks to his extraordinary eyesight, Bai Yunfei was able to locate a small lake and stream where he made a mental remark to head towards later.</p>
 <p>The thigh of a soulbeast was taken out from Bai Yunfei’s space ring. Nearly fifty kilograms in weight, Bai Yunfei started the cumbersome task of preparing it for lunch while Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan stared off from the sides with drool leaking out from their mouths.</p>
 <p>In the case of Xiao Lan, the disgraceful status it was in now had only one special benefit in that it could eat delicious foods like this.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was only enough to fulfill its cravings. If it really wanted to eat its full, it’d have to head out and hunt for itself.</p>
 <p>The meal was eaten without distraction and in peace. After it, Bai Yunfei sat upon the grassy grounds with a map of the Soulbeast Forest in one hand and a jade slip in the other. Carefully, he marked down everything he had traveled upon that day onto the map.</p>
 <p>Ever since he entered the class six area of the forest, Bai Yunfei tried his best to fill in the blanks of the map given to him by writing down the terrain of the forest or any other markings that might detail the situation of the soulbeasts there.</p>
 <p>Either way, it was done in hopes of helping him prepare for the future if he needed it.</p>
 <p>Not too far away, the chibi blue-eyes wyrm was laying on the ground to bask in the sun. Ever since it started ‘following’ Bai Yunfei, it was finally able to experience what it was like to ‘enjoy life’.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Qi was flying around the skies as if working off the meal.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Chirp!!!”</p>
 <p>Then out of nowhere, the sudden chirp of Xiao Qi snapped Bai Yunfei out from his notes!</p>
 <p>Rising to his feet, Bai Yunfei looked towards the source of the chirp, where he could see Xiao Qi chirping happily for some reason just barely a kilometer away.</p>
 <p>Relieved that there was no danger to be seen, Bai Yunfei relaxed. It seemed that Xiao Qi had discovered something, so with that in mind, Bai Yunfei took out the Tempest Sword and pulled the chibi blue-eyes wyrm onto it to fly towards Xiao Qi’s position.</p>
 <p>He came to a short stop right by Xiao Qi’s side soon after, “What’s up, Xiao Qi?’</p>
 <p>“Chirp chirp~!” Xiao Qi chirped twice, pointing its beak forwards.</p>
 <p>Following its look, Bai Yunfei turned his head to look several hundred meters ahead where a sheer cliff wall was. All over the cliff was a green mass of what appeared to be a variety of plant life.</p>
 <p>Registering some of the botanical life in his eyes, Bai Yunfei looked stunned for a moment.</p>
 <p>“Those are….”</p>
