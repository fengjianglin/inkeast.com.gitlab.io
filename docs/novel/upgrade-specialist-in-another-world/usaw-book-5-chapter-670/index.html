 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does this mean….he still might just be someone from the Soul Refining School?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed as the idea came back to his mind. This man might really be a soul refiner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, he had never heard of anyone that wasn’t from the Soul Refining School being able to absorb someone else’s soulforce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a secret only the Soul Refining School knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it felt as though everyone that was in the Soul Refining School was a soul cultivator with two affinities. Aside from one of the more commonly seen elements, they had also darkness as their secondary—Wu Shang was fitting the same examples right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Again the Soul Refining School! They’re absolutely everywhere—just how large are they?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His conjecture on Wu Shang’s identity was startling to Bai Yunfei. Now wasn’t the time for him to be thinking about what kind of machinations the Soul Refining School was up to now, however. Now that he knew the stats and general information of the chain, Bai Yunfei had to think about what to do now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The very first thing to do was to disentangle the chains around his right arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even ten seconds from when the chains first touched Bai Yunfei to when Bai Yunfei figured out the stats of it had passed. Though it was a short amount of time, Bai Yunfei had already lost almost three hundred points of soulforce!! It wasn’t a relatively very large number in his case, but losing soulforce like this would gradually build up. And even more importantly….it’d make an extended battle even harder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he couldn’t let the chain stay close to him any longer. If Wu Shang were to try and attack him now, Bai Yunfei wouldn’t be able to dodge it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s right arm shook so as to try and dislodge the chains around his forearm off. Unfortunately for him, a low-heaven tier soul armament like these chains wouldn’t be so easily thrown off. No matter which way he shook his right arm, the chains shook with him like a snake to stay on. In the end, the chains only wrapped around his arm even more so that the four coils that had previously been around his bracer was now multiple crings reaching to his shoulder!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The unbelievably sharp tip of the chain was moving fluidly with a sheen of black light to stab into Bai Yunfei’s shoulder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alarmed, Bai Yunfei brought his left arm up to block the tip from hitting him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qi!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t need to call out to Xiao Qi however, as the bird was already flying on over with a furious trill. Wu Shang’s attack onto Bai Yunfei with the chains had ruined Xiao Qi’s original plan, causing the bird to briefly pause for two seconds before growing angry at seeing Bai Yunfei get attacked. Wings flashing green, nearly a hundred blades of wind were thrown out at the emerging figure of Wu Shang. Unfortunately, all Wu Shang had to do was raise his left hand and block all of the blades of wind coming his way. Several of the blades of wind aimed at the chains had only smashed onto the links in a myriad of sparks, but the chains remained intact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi already knew regular attacks were useless before Bai Yunfei had called out to him. Still furious, Xiao Qi began to materialize five different Spatial Edges in front of them. They formed into five long blades of absolute nothing before sailing towards Wu Shang and his chain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Wu Shang looked at the attacks coming at him with a solemn expression. He had been on guard against Xiao Qi ever since he found out about his affinity for space. As the Spatial Edges approached, Wu Shang pushed off with his left foot to easily dodge the attacks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! Xiao Qi, again!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei cried out to the bird while trying to retreat himself—when Wu Shang dodged the Spatial Edges, he took off into the direction Bai Yunfei was in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was slack in between the chains now that Wu Shang was rushing for Bai Yunfei. Now with some freedom to move, Bai Yunfei started to run back as well. Needless to say, Wu Shang being close to Bai Yunfei would only be dangerous for him, but because of the strange motions of the chains, he was well on the way to becoming as wrapped up as a present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more Wu Shang drew close to Bai Yunfei, the more the chains in Wu Shang’s hand began to shrink. That also meant that the distance between Bai Yunfei and him was shrinking! With him being faster than Bai Yunfei, Wu Shang had confidence that he’d be able to easily defeat Bai Yunfei when the time came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, Wu Shang had actually many methods of killing Bai Yunfei from far away. The only thing preventing him from using those methods was him wanting to interrogate Bai Yunfei before he killed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But when he was within fifty meters of Bai Yunfei, Xiao Qi made his second attempt. The first volley of Spatial Edges failed, but with another circulation of his soulforce, xiao Qi materialized another five blades to attack Wu Shang with them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even caring for the effort it took to materialize five Spatial Edges at the same time, Xiao Qi had the five go straight for the midway between Bai Yunfei and Wu Shang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Wu Shang continued forward, he’d be hit by the Spatial Edges. If he retreated, then the chains would be hit by the Spatial edges instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mocking sneer appeared on Wu Shang’s face rather than indecisive concern. Coming to a stop, Wu Shang swung his right arm towards the right. By doing this, the chains in his hand clanked around for a bit before extending the number of chains between him and Bai Yunfei by a certain amount and forcing Bai Yunfei to fly towards the right!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The chains in the middle lengthened in size while also arcing to the right to swing Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And in the end, the Spatial Edges failed to hit their targets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the effort it took to create the second volley of Spatial Edges, Xiao Qi’s strength took a sharp dip while also preventing him from doing anything else in response to Wu Shang’s action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Casting a quick glance to the bird, Wu Shang smirked before continuing his rush at Bai Yunfei. It was then that he realized there was a humming sensation coming from his chains….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising an eyebrow, Wu Shang looked sixty meters in front of him where Bai Yunfei was violently yanking at the chains, causing a parabolic motion to transmit horizontally across the chains. Because of the increase in slack and him being swung to the side, Bai Yunfei had a good ten meter segment of the chain to work with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Shang’s face whitened a moment later when he saw Bai Yunfei pull out his Fire-tipped Spear and thrust it into the segment of the chain he had manipulated into coming closer to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clink….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clear sound of collision could be heard when the spear touched onto the chain. It was a long, but single sound, and although Wu Shang heard what seemed like a single blow, there was actually eighty-one attacks in that one spear thrust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was...the Eighty-one Fold Stab!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tremendous explosion rocked the world as dazzling flames shot forth from the midpoint between spear and chain. Within the explosion and flames, a faint cracking sound could be heard….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei could be seen leaping away shortly afterwards. In his right hand was a dozen-meter long segment of the chains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pcht….”</span></p>
