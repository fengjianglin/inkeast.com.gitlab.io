 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk!!” The Soul King cursed to himself. Several people were dying in front of him while he had been thinking, and that only made him even more flustered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The event horizon was rapidly approaching, and if Bai Yunfei was given any more time, then….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the top of the blue-eyes wyrm’s head, a fiery Bai Yunfei was striking out left and right with his spear working like the reaper’s scythe to perforate the chest of an enemy. There were only mid-stage and late-stage Soul Exalts here, and none of them were strong enough to fight against Bai Yunfei. Even if they were peak late-stage Soul Exalts, they still wouldn’t be enough!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any and all types of defense was virtually ineffective against the Fire-tipped Spear. With each stroke, the Fire-tipped Spear found itself spearing through another victim!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the mid-stage Soul Exalt expelled a mouthful of blood from their mouths when struck by the spear before crumpling to the ground, unable to fight anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a matter of seconds, Bai Yunfei had killed four people, leaving behind only two peak late-stage and one late-stage Soul Exalts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having been suppressed by the Soul Exalts until Bai Yunfei came, the blue-eyes wyrm could finally let loose. Roaring aloud, the wyrm lashed out with its tail to bisect a caught off-guard late-stage Soul Exalt! With its right forelimb, it clawed at a peak late-stage Soul Exalt, sending three separate blades of elemental water to force the Soul Exalt back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei continued to attack the enemies to his left, but when he heard the sound of rolling thunder overhead, he narrowed his eyes. Without bothering to even look up, he waved his left hand to summon the Cataclysmic Seal to him. Expanding to over ten meters in size, it served as an overhead shield for him, blocking a thick bolt of purple lightning from striking him. The Cataclysmic Seal shuddered from the attack and was forced down to the ground, but not before Bai Yunfei leapt out of the way. Waving his hand again, the Cataclysmic Seal shrunk in size to fall back down to the ground to avoid being hit by the remaining lightning bolts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His left hand lashed out again, this time to block the Thunder Halberd from striking at his left side. Raising his right hand, he lashed out with the Fire-tipped Spear to attack the figure in purple holding the halberd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning-type Soul King had finally deigned himself to strike again with all his might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack of a mid-stage Soul King was without a doubt a very intimidating thing to face down. The surrounding hundred meters was washed with purple light as elemental lightning turned the place into a pool of lightning. At its very center, the Soul King’s figure flickered like lightning to move around a figure on fire to attack at every angle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all the lightning and explosions, the blue-eyes wyrm was forced to step beyond the boundary of the lightning pool and near the end of the illusionary matrix to fight the remaining Soul Exalts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were Bai Yunfei before he went crazy with Berserk Mode, an attack like this would’ve left Bai Yunfei completely unable to deal with it, or at least, defend against the attack at the cost of a great deal of his health. He’d normally want to back away and wait for one of his equipment effects to activate before making a counter attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, he could choose to fight with his spear and attack the Soul King without any fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King himself felt like he was going crazy. Whatever it was that was happening in front of him, it shouldn’t be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Bai Yunfei right in front of him and the Bai Yunfei from before were practically two different people!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was fighting as if there wasn’t any form of self-preservation to him anymore. Whenever they fought, Bai Yunfei would only move out of the way if the incoming attack would be a mortal one, increasing the amount of injuries he had one by one! Each time the Thunder Halberd came at him, Bai Yunfei would parry it to the side and strike out with his spear. With each palm strike aimed at him, Bai Yunfei would return it with a palm strike of his own….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of ‘kill a thousand lose eight hundred’ tactic was something that didn’t suit well for the Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the more he fought Bai Yunfei, the more he learned about Bai Yunfei. The exchange of attacks between the two gave the Soul King some time to look and count each of the soul armaments Bai Yunfei had. Whether it was the Fire-tipped Spear, his two gloves, his two bracers, his armor, or even his shoes—they were all high-leveled soul armaments!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The force the Soul King was putting behind of his strikes was enough to kill any peak late-stage Soul Exalt. But Bai Yunfei hadn’t even been losing any strength behind his own blows even after parrying each attack with his arms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Bai Yunfei’s aura was….still growing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If an outsider were to look at Bai Yunfei now, they would’ve thought Bai Yunfei was also a Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a cracking sound as the Thunder Halberd slammed into the Fire-tipped Spear and was met with an explosion. The explosion had destroyed the halberd and consequently numbed the hand of the Soul King holding it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Bai Yunfei wasn’t in good shape himself. The elemental lightning he was being constantly struck with was causing pain to Bai Yunfei whenever he was hit with it. He was happy that he had destroyed the weapon of the Soul King however, and he didn’t seem to really care about the purple lightning arcing around his body. Raising a shining yellow left hand, he plunged it downwards to attack the Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light of opportunity shined in the Soul King’s eyes at this. Having been completely inhibited by the self-mutilating tactics of Bai Yunfei, the Soul King had had enough. Without regard for the fist coming at his abdomen, the Soul King chopped at Bai Yunfei’s throat with the edge of his palm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he his internal organs were struck, he’d decapitate Bai Yunfei!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both fighters were risking their lives with this, though the Soul King had never thought he’d be forced to fight to an extent like this….but that didn’t matter anymore. Even if he was severely wounded, at least Bai Yunfei would be dead. His death would accomplish his mission, and he’d be able to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one thing that surprised the Soul King even more was the fact that Bai Yunfei’s eyes seemed to glow even more crazily. He bent his body in a way that brought his head not away from his hand, but….towards it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeming as if he wasn’t even considering his own life as important in this attack, Bai Yunfei’s forehead came forward to meet with the lightning-type Soul King’s blade hand while his left hand was still heading for the Soul King’s stomach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a muffled explosion as the Soul King was sent flying away like a bullet while Bai Yunfei himself had his head knocked backwards, but still very much connected to his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But….what surprised the Soul King most about this interaction was the fact that Bai Yunfei came to a stop ten meters away, his legs standing back on the platform as he shook his head. He spat out a bloody glob of spit, but other than that, Bai Yunfei had been completely fine!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pfft!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mouthful of blood came out from the Soul King’s own mouth from his injuries. Glaring heavily at Bai Yunfei, he stared at the dark light glowing from the Soul Sentinel Scarf with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Im….impossible!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King cried out loud this time. Eyes lighting up, Bai Yunfei put away his Fire-tipped Spear and brought both of his arms up. Elemental fire started to draw inwards into his body before swirling around his arms. With enough energy stored, he lashed out with both fists!</span></p>
