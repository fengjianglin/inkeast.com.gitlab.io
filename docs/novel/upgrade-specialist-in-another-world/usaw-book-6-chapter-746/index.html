 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

All of the Soul Kings standing there looked a little surprised at that, some of them even wrinkling their eyebrows at the sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a strange pocket this is. Does this mean the entrance will last for a longer time? A pocket that only opens after a set amount of time like this one shouldn’t behave like this….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who spoke was the red-robed elder representative from the Fire School. His aura was blazing wildly so that he looked like a human fireball with his aura intimidating the others. His eyes were glued to the entrances of the pocket as he muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How truly strange. I’ve never seen a pocket have this many entrances either. It’s almost as if the pocket meant to have multiple people enter it….” The green-robed elder from the Wood School muttered in confusion next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who knows how many years this pocket laid undetected.” The elder from the Metal School spoke up. “It’s not implausible to say the Extreme King Pills have been resting here for a thousand years. With how ridiculous the rules of this pocket is, I wonder just what kind of precursor created this pocket. I’d have to wager that someone as strong as a Mid-stage Soul Emperor would have to be responsible for this. Is this the place where he died then? If he’s dead, then…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t finish talking, but the other two elders with him knew what he meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If there really was the body of a deceased Soul Emperor in there, then the Extreme King Pills would only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of treasure….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a guess no one really had the answer to though. If this pocket really did belong to a Soul Emperor, then how could anyone be so easily allowed in? Besides, no Soul King was even able to enter the pocket, so that made this theory a little less plausible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder from the Wood School sighed. “It’s useless guessing about anything with these restrictions in place. We can’t even go in, so we can only hope one of our youngsters will be able to get the prize….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two nodded. “Now that the pocket is open, we shouldn’t have to dwell about these things. But the longer we wait, the more annoying this will become. Those factions who haven’t yet arrived will soon be here, and that only means more competitors for the Extreme King Pills. There aren’t enough pills for everyone, so a battle will surely break out. Once it does, the safety of our younger ones will be hard to guarantee….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder from the Metal School nodded in agreement. “I agree, but nothing can be done about it. It’s not as if we can’t stop the others from going into the pocket, can we?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His question was more of a joke than a question. Combined, the three of them might be able to push back one or two factions without trouble, but that would be an egregious act, one that would paint them out to be immoral characters. Neither would they care to do such a thing anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

They couldn’t enter the pocket or know what was going on, so the only thing they could do was wait outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King from the Hengyang School stood alone next to a tree, his eyes shining with a calculative light. Of all the Soul Kings, he was the one most unnerved by the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew what had happened really when he touched the pocket and tried to gain entry, and the events that transpired in that moment brought not small amount of vexation to the Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He withdrew from the barrier almost instantly when he tried to enter, everyone saw that. It wasn’t because of the pocket starting to show signs of instability that he did it though….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, the reason why he left so quickly was because of the repelling force from within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if the pocket was actively trying to force him out!</span></p>

This guess was a chilling one and his eyes reflected his sentiments with a look of dread and terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have to be wrong. Those people stronger than me can be found anywhere. The Beast Taming School came into this pocket earlier and felt nothing, I have to be wrong….”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p>

It wasn’t too different than the feeling he got after he crossed the barrier that protected the Underworld School, but this one was far more noticeable in its effects. Everything was a pure white light in front of him, and it felt like all five of his senses, six including his soulsense, had shorted out. But they came back to him after a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clack….”</span></p>

He had entered the pocket through the air, but somehow, he was now standing at the ground level almost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The very first thing Bai Yunfei did afterwards was call out his Cataclysmic Seal and adopt a defensive position to scan the vicinity.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Already turning to Jing Mingfeng as he spoke, Bai Yunfei came to an abrupt stop when he realized something.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He got over the shock soon enough to think about what might’ve happened. “The entrance….how strange. It splits us apart even if we enter through the same entrance at the same time. Is….is that why Lin Dongxiao was all by himself….?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was one of the people that saw Lin Dongxiao running by himself earlier and thought it was strange to see since he had entered with three other people. But now he knew the reason. He didn’t know why exactly, but the pocket was forcibly separating everyone so they would have to be by themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But….what’s the point of splitting everyone up? There’s no one within a kilometer of each other…..what is this pocket trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei looked up to the skies. It was a blue sky with a few white clouds, but he didn’t see the sun here. This was very clearly not the real sky and just a ‘fake’ rendition of it from within the pocket. Staring at it for two seconds longer, Bai Yunfei took off into the skies to check the ground from there.</span></p>

By Skywalking, Soul Exalts could ascend into the sky!</span></p>

The most basic ones came in the form of space-type soul armaments and could only store dead objects inside its otherwise small area. More advanced pockets of space had generally very few differences between them and reality and allowed people to go into them. Strong enough factions had one or two of such pockets to store their more peculiar things in there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were also very special types of pockets a few of the even stronger soul cultivators had where they could stay and train in without disturbance. These pockets are bigger than their weaker counterparts and would normally replicate the outside landscape such as the mountains, trees, and water. In a way, the pocket ‘copied’ what was outside into the inside so as to make it very hard to discover. These types of pockets would not allow entry from anyone else without the master of it saying otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And lastly, there were a few very special pockets that had its own ‘rules’. ‘Restrictions’ that it could impose, such as not being able to burn anything inside, having a stronger force of gravity than outside, etc. But of course, these types of pockets were extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And if Bai Yunfei’s guess was right, then this pocket he was in was very much one of those very rare pockets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t Skywalk in here!</span></p>

Giving up on trying to experiment with it, he looked around the place to see if there was anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To come across such an annoying problem right off the bat was a bit vexing, and it made Bai Yunfei worried on what other problems he’d run into in here….</span></p>
