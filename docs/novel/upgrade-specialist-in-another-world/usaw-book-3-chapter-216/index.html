 <p>Chapter 216: A 'Defect' In the Upgrade Technique</p>
 <p>Nighttime in the courtyard for the disciples.</p>
 <p>Seated on top of his bed, Bai Yunfei’s hands clutched tightly at the silvery throwing knife he had made.</p>
 <p>This was the very first piece of equipment he had crafted. Though it was an incomplete soul armament, but even if he were given the option to switch it out for an earth-tier one, he’d be unwilling.</p>
 <p>After plenty of thought, Bai Yunfei took back the knife and replaced it with the space ring given to him by Kou Changkong.</p>
 <p>A single scan of its contents had been all that was needed for Bai Yunfei’s heart to skip a beat; the interior of the ring was a hundred square meters! All sorts of objects were placed inside, but the amount of vermiculite in there alone was definitely over a thousand individual ores! Even several hundred different types of primal stones were in there….</p>
 <p>The contents of this ring was so abundant that if he were to throw it to the outside world, many of the smaller schools would definitely fight each other for it.</p>
 <p>But in the Crafting School, it was merely items given to a disciple for ‘practice’....</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t the type of person to care about matters like ‘value’. He was only surprised by the amount of it all. With such a large amount of materials, he’d be able to make use of it for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Scanning the rest of the inner contents, Bai Yunfei then shook his hand and retrieved a crimson scroll out from the ring.</p>
 <p>This was the detailed scroll Kou Changkong had said to have described the art of crafting on a more technical level.</p>
 <p>Storing away the space ring, Bai Yunfei recollected himself and begun to read from the scroll.</p>
 <p>Ands so, three hours went by….</p>
 <p>Finally, Bai Yunfei closed his eyes as he soaked in the information. With a drawn out sigh, he spoke, “How ridiculous, what I’ve learned so far was only just the tip of the iceberg. There’s at least a thousand different combinations of compounding materials for just human-tier soul armaments alone! I wonder how long it’ll take before I learn everything on this scroll….</p>
 <p>“But it’s a good thing master has taught me all these days. ‘One principle learned is another hundred understood’. If I can understand one subject, I will be able to understand the rest.”</p>
 <p>After looking through the contents of the scroll once, Bai Yunfei decided to study the introduction first. It was about what he had already learned, but he still spent a single night studying in earnest over the subject…..</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>On the morning of the second day, Bai Yunfei sought out Song Lin and had a cave arranged for himself. When the two arrived at the caves, Bai Yunfei leapt up to one of the topmost caves to the left while the rest of the students watched him in fear and respect.</p>
 <p>“Junior Bai, this cave will be yours from now on. Whatever materials you need in the crafting process can be asked to the juniors down below for help.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, thank you very much, senior.”</p>
 <p>After Song Lin left, Bai Yunfei was the only one left in the cave. Looking around himself, he started to familiarize himself with the layout of the cave.</p>
 <p>It was about four meters in width and several hundred meters deep. The entrance itself was ten meters in square area, and if one were to travel the small passageway through, a spacious area without anything else in there could be walked to.</p>
 <p>Touching the cave, Bai Yunfei took notice that the walls were impeccably hard. It kind of felt like metal to the touch, and the entire cave itself looked extremely solid and hard to crack open.</p>
 <p>Walking to the center of the room, Bai Yunfei sat down in a crossed-legged position and took out the space ring given to him by Kou Changkong.</p>
 <p>As per usual, a single notification popped up.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up, <em>“Superior!”</em></p>
 <p>This would be the very first time he’d come across a superior piece of accessory. No sooner than a hum later, Bai Yunfei had already upgraded it to +8.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">

    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade:&nbsp;Superior<p></p><p>Upgrade Level: +8</p><p>Additional Attribute: +66 Strength</p></strong><p><strong></strong><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 54&nbsp;Soulpoints</strong></p></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Upgrading the ring anymore than now had the risk of failure, so Bai Yunfei decided to stop then and there. He looked at the ring and hummed, <em>“66 Strength at just +8, that means it’ll be in the hundreds almost by +10….I wonder what type of difference there’ll be compared to ‘rare’ accessories? I’ll have to find a time to ask a senior if it’s possible to craft accessory-related equipment….”</em></p>
 <p>Disregarding that topic for now, Bai Yunfei waved his hand so that the crafting cauldron came plopping onto the ground in front of him. A platform was arranged prior to the placement of the cauldron so that it was now at his chest level. This was a very suitable height for crafting.</p>
 <p>After the cauldron was taken out, Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows flew up as if something suddenly occurred to him. Pressing a hand to the cauldron, he allowed for a notification to pop up.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: Low Legacy (Unique)<p></p></strong><p><strong></strong><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 86&nbsp;Soulpoints</strong></p></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was surprised.</p>
 <p><em>“Uh….what’s going on?”</em> Bai Yunfei had a double take at this. Only two pieces of information had surfaced in his head, but nothing else. <em>“Low Legacy with a note for it being ‘special’? It has no attributes, no attack or defense, or even anything else….Is this considered an equipment even? Or is this like how the accessories work, do I have to upgrade it first? This is considered to be a low-grade earth-tier armament. Interesting….”</em></p>
 <p>He upgraded it, but aside from a +1 notification, there was nothing else that popped up.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was yet again at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>“The upgrade stone was ‘unique’ as well, but even that had an effect even though it couldn’t be upgraded.”</p>
 <p>But this crafting cauldron was a ‘Low Legacy” while also being ‘unique’ with no effect. Not even an attribute was to be seen, and neither a change to be seen after being upgraded….</p>
 <p><em>“This is a little….how do I say it….chaotic. Could this be a ‘defect’ in the Upgrade Technique?!”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s heart trembled at the thought. If a problem really did crop up in the Upgrade Technique, it would be the very same as a problem to his very own life.</p>
 <p>Rushing to take out a few accessories and equipment, Bai Yunfei began to upgrade them one by one.</p>
 <p>Having seen no problems, Bai Yunfei let out a sigh in relief,<em> “It’s all good. Nothing changed so far, does that mean the crafting cauldron is too unique? But….this has to be a defect in the Upgrade Technique. I didn’t come across a lot of equipment before, so this problem never came up. But as soon as I met the upgrade stone and the crafting cauldron, the shortcomings become more apparent….Won’t this mean in the future, I’ll come across even more problems?”</em></p>
 <p>The more he thought about it, the more worried he got. He depended on the Upgrade Technique far too much, so if even more ‘defects’ appeared in the Upgrade Technique….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei shook his head, he didn’t want to pursue that line of thought.</p>
 <p><em>“I can’t be thinking about that right now. It’s pointless no matter how much I think about it. I’ll just have to leave it for later….”</em> Bai Yunfei thought. <em>“What I really need to do right now is to study the art of crafting. There’s only half a year left, I have to make an earth-tier soul armament no matter what to become a true disciple!!”</em></p>
 <p>Focusing, Bai Yunfei spent the next half hour to calm himself back down so that he could start crafting.</p>
 <p>Armed with the experience of yesterday and his reflection from the night after, Bai Yunfei was able to easily make a single three inch throwing knife in half an hour.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>He eyed the stats quizzically,<em> “The attack is a little lower than yesterday, where did I go wrong?”</em></p>
 <p>Thinking to practically every detail he could think about, Bai Yunfei decided to take out some more materials and try again.</p>
 <p>Another half hour later….</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded his head in satisfaction, <em>“Okay, got it. Those two steps weren’t accurate enough, and some other factors need to be considered a little more. Let’s try again….”</em></p>
 <p>He tried every way he could think of so that success and failure happened as often as the other. Without a single break, an entire day went by.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>Eyes lighting up in excitement, Bai Yunfei took the silver throwing knife into his hands with a happy smile. “I’ve finally made a low rare grade equipment! It’s just barely in the range of a soul armament, but this is still an improvement from before!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was dark outside, Bai Yunfei thought to himself, <em>“It’s getting late, I’ll stop here then and focus on my training a little longer. I’ll continue crafting tomorrow!”</em></p>
