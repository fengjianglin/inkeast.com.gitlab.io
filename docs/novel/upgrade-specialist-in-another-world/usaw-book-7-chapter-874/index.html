We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything.

The majority of people were already making their ways over, either by running or by flying soul armament, but most of these people were Soul Exalts at the very least. And there were a few people teleporting through the skies—these were the Soul Kings!</span></p>

And neither should it be the crafting of a heaven-tier soul armament, since one night is far too short of a time frame to craft one, and neither do I sense the key energies one would expect from that. So I would wager that…someone advanced a stage in their training…”</span></p>

He was an Early-stage Soul King yesterday, could he have become a Mid-stage Soul King?! That’s…that’s just…”</span></p>

Is Bai Yunfei really advancing in a stage?” Extremely curious for an answer, Tang Jing asked Tang Zhan for assistance.</span></p>

I cannot see what’s happening beyond that spatial tear either. It’ll be trouble if anyone tries to get close. We should wait until this matter resolves itself for an answer…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even great grandfather can’t look into that?!” Tang Jing’s eyes were wide open in shock at the answer.</span></p>

Less and less was starting to pour in, but there was still a substantial amount coming through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, Bai Yunfei came to a point in his advancement where he no longer needed any more elemental fire. The flames in the air quickly started to disperse now that they had nowhere to go, and the maelstrom of fire around Bai Yunfei was now transformed into a small ball to obscure Bai Yunfei from sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Xiao Qi was still taking in as much as the elemental energy the Core World had to offer. His aura was still climbing even after reaching the levels of a mid-stage class seven. Killing all those Soul Kings had clearly given him a lot more benefit than initially expected. Despite it being impossible for Xiao Qi to jump straight to the late-stage level, the bird had still built up a decent amount of progress towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Minutes passed before the ball of fire Bai Yunfei was in trembled once before starting to shrink in on itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s figure could soon be seen behind the flames, but he wasn’t alone. Something else was floating up in front of him, the Fire-tipped Spear.</span></p>

It was pulsating a faint red light while a stream of fire encircled it almost like if a dragon was trying to coil around it. Even more importantly was the aura radiating from the Fire-tipped Spear. It didn’t feel like an ‘object’ that was without life, something about it felt…alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei looked ecstatic at the Fire-tipped Spear. He wasn’t even paying attention to the fact that he was a Mid-stage Soul King. All he was paying attention to was the Fire-tipped Spear in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising his right hand up to touch the Fire-tipped Spear, he watched as it spun around Bai Yunfei as if it was alive before finally floating back to his hand.</span></p>

For soul cultivators who were Soul Kings at the very least, they could use the power of their soul to try and craft or refine a soul armament into a soulbound armament. It wasn’t a process as special or simplistic as the ones a crafter would use, but it still served its purpose. Lifebound armaments were something only those from the Crafting School would be able to make.</span></p>

It wasn’t limited to that one moment when one broke through to become a Soul King, but it was generally the easiest time. The soul would undergo a great boost in strength during the breakthrough and so the chances of successfully crafting something was much much higher then.</span></p>

He knew that one of the criteria was to have the Fire-tipped Spear reach max compatibility with him, but it was only 90% the last time he checked, Barring the Cataclysmic Seal and Soul Sentinel Scarf, the Fire-tipped Spear was the next soul armament with the highest level of compatibility with him. The next soul armament would be the Critical Gloves with 86% compatibility. Both items were what he used most to fight, but it seemed only natural that the Fire-tipped Spear would be the first to gain the chance.</span></p>

When he undid the seal for Realm Accretion to breakthrough and become a Soul King, Bai Yunfei tried to refine the Fire-tipped Spear while the King’s Phenomena blocked him from sight. In the end, he was far too rushed to do a good job at it, and the Fire-tipped Spear stopped just shy of the goal at 99%.</span></p>

And in that moment of advancement, the elemental fire around his person was powerful enough to finish the job on the Fire-tipped Spear.</span></p>

But for Bai Yunfei, the ‘improbable’ was merely just a guideline for Bai Yunfei to be exempted from.</span></p>

During that time, the Fire-tipped Spear was elevated a tier in grade, and now the same thing was happening when he became a Mid-stage Soul King!</span></p>

And not only was its attack stronger by several times now, but its additional effect was also a lot stronger!</span></p>

Following him throughout all this time, the Fire-tipped Spear had grown stronger whenever Bai Yunfei grew stronger. The change throughout the journey was almost magical with how it became so powerful!</span></p>
