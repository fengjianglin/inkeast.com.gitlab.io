 <p>Chapter 293: Strength is as Shown</p>
 <p>The Four Death Gods were true to their name—the eldest most definitely. Insta Die had indeed been killed in one shot.</p>
 <p>This development felt slightly nonsensical, but Bai Yunfei managed to adapt to the situation fast enough.</p>
 <p>While the three men were still despairing over the death of their brothers, Bai Yunfei immediately shot away, landing next to Big Dagger and Little Dagger.</p>
 <p>“This one is named Bai Yunfei, a student of the Crafting School. Please don’t be afraid, I am not your enemy.” Seeing that the two men were holding their weapons vigilantly in front of them when Bai Yunfei approached, Bai Yunfei moved his spear behind him to denote his friendliness, and he introduced himself to make himself less suspicious.</p>
 <p>“Crafting School?” Han Chong questioned in surprise. As was common sense in the world, he couldn’t take Bai Yunfei’s words at face value, so he didn’t drop his guard around Bai Yunfei. Though he concluded that Bai Yunfei had not come to help the Four Death Gods since he had just killed one of them.</p>
 <p>The only question that remained to be seen was whether or not Bai Yunfei would try to help the Flying Dagger brothers before backstabbing them for the final spoils.</p>
 <p>Han Chong had some doubts about that question too. If that was indeed the case, then Bai Yunfei’s appearance in the fight would be a little ‘early.’ Furthermore…</p>
 <p><em>“A late-stage Soul Warrior?”</em></p>
 <p>Han Chong nearly doubted what he was feeling for a moment. A late-stage Soul Warrior was an incredibly weak soul cultivator in this battle, just what business did he have poking his nose here!?</p>
 <p><em>“That’s not right! When he first came out… that definitely wasn’t the strength of a Soul Warrior. Even Han Lin wouldn’t be able to move as fast as he did.” Han Chong thought. “But… I can’t feel any elements from his body. Is he just so strong that I can’t even sense it?”</em></p>
 <p>He dismissed the thought with a shake of his head. It was far too nonsensical to accept.</p>
 <p>“Ah, so you are, sire Bai…” Han Chong nodded politely. “We have never met before, I’m sure. Might I inquire why you are helping us brothers?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei took a look at the man. Han Chong had a skinny, but handsome face with eyes that revealed his intelligent and calm demeanor. “Well… let’s take care of the remaining three before I say anything more. Don’t worry, I won’t try to fight for your prize.”</p>
 <p>The last part was spoken partly in jest, but Han Chong didn’t say anything more. He turned his eyes back to his enemies.</p>
 <p>Over there, the three remaining Death Gods had gathered around each other; each one glaring daggers at Bai Yunfei with murderous auras.</p>
 <p>“Brat, I’ll make you pay for taking our eldest brother’s life away!!”</p>
 <p>Never Die howled. His giant blade rose into the air, activating his armament skill like before. The power in this skill was several times stronger than before. The three blades materialized in the air with a hundred meters between each blade, surrounding Bai Yunfei and the other two!</p>
 <p>Must Die and Go Die gave each other a look of tacit agreement while Never Die was preparing to strike. The sword in Go Die’s hand detached from the middle as a wave of soulforce exploded from him, extending the weapon with an orange light. He then stabbed it into the ground.</p>
 <p>While Go Die was extending his sword, Must Die was doing something strange with his feet before he sunk into the ground!</p>
 <p>A wave of orange light came from Go Die’s feet and transformed into a tidal wave of earth. From where Must Die was hidden in the earth, a small bump could be seen as he ‘swam’ toward Bai Yunfei to attack!</p>
 <p>In their fury, the three Death Gods were now using their strongest killing moves to fight this battle!!</p>
 <p>The three blades dragged across the ground as well, leaving behind a trench of dirt in their wakes. Han Chong’s pupils expanded slightly in shock before he dove for Han Lin, trying to push him out of the way again.</p>
 <p>Then a pair of hands touched the shoulders of both brothers, revealing Bai Yunfei behind them with a smile. “Allow me to deal with this.”</p>
 <p>“You!!”</p>
 <p>Han Chong didn’t why Bai Yunfei was so unflustered, but what he did know was that Bai Yunfei was preventing the two from moving!!</p>
 <p>The three of them had lost their chance of dodging because of a moment’s hesitation. The attacks of their enemies were already upon them.</p>
 <p>Despair and anger flooded Han Chong’s eyes; he didn’t know what to do, but what he could do was stay angry at Bai Yunfei since he had stopped the two brothers from dodging.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei continued to smile as if there wasn’t any danger. After he stopped Han Lin and Han Chong, he moved forward to greet the incoming attacks from all around with a spirited look.</p>
 <p>“Bzz…”</p>
 <p>The sound of something vibrating made its way into Han Lin and Han Chong’s ears, causing them to look to the source. A bubble of orange light surrounded the three of them. Right above Bai Yunfei’s head, an equally orange light was creating the orange glow around them.</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal!!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>Now on the verge of collision, the fearsome blades of metallic energy collided with the area around Bai Yunfei along with many stone spikes.</p>
 <p>The snarl on Never Die’s face soon turned to a expression of satisfaction with his vengeance enacted. Just as he prepared to recollect himself, the look on his face froze as he realized an issue, “What… but how!?”</p>
 <p>Casting his soulsense out, Never Die realized that the auras of the three people were still there—vibrant and strong as ever!</p>
 <p>What did that mean? It meant that the combined killing moves of the three Death Gods didn’t do a thing to them!</p>
 <p>From within the orange light, Han Chong and Han Lin were staring in dumbfounded shock at the earthen barrier erected around them. Neither of the two spoke for some time, but as a late-stage Soul Ancestor, Han Chong was at a complete loss of words by this inconceivable sight.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei let out a discrete sigh of relief where he stood, but not because he blocked the attack. Blocking the attack was within his expectations—if it couldn’t, then the Cataclysmic Seal would be considered a disgrace to every mid-heaven tier soul armament. What he was really worried about harm to the essence fireseed inside it. From what he saw, nothing had changed, so Bai Yunfei felt as though he had been worrying over nothing.</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>There was a slightly weaker sound from beneath his feet, causing the ground to tremble slightly. Both of Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up with murderous intent, and right in front of the still surprised eyes of Han Lin and Han Chong, Bai Yunfei’s Fire-tipped Spear stabbed a meter into the ground!</p>
 <p>The spear slid into the ground without resistance for almost an entire meter, and then...</p>
 <p>“Boom!!’</p>
 <p>An even louder sound than before rocked the area.</p>
 <p>Mixed into the explosion, the agonizing screams of a person could be heard.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had used the Threefold Stab. It didn’t matter when the explosive effect of the spear would activate since he had manipulated the range of the barrier to protect him from the backlash of the explosion.</p>
 <p>Never Die and Go Die stared at the source of the explosion for a brief moment in confusion. The dust cloud that had been kicked up earlier was dispersed by Bai Yunfei’s fiery strike, allowing the two to see that Bai Yunfei and the Han brothers were completely unharmed, and right in front of Bai Yunfei, a three-to-four-meter-long hole could be seen.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the ground in the area exploded with dirt, spitting out the person that had been hiding below! With a bang, the person tumbled to the ground. It was Must Die, but he was in a tragic state of being. His entire person was a charcoal black, and his clothes were torn apart.</p>
 <p>What was even more frightful was that his right arm was completely gone!!</p>
 <p>His right shoulder was pitch-black, and a heavy flow of dark-red blood streamed from the stump and pooled on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Third brother!!”</p>
 <p>Blanching at the sight, Never Die flew to Must Die’s side and grabbed his right shoulder. A moment later, a bubble of elemental water started to spread from Never Die’s palm to Must Die’s shoulder stump, immediately starting the clotting process. With no more blood flowing from the stump, the contorted face of Must Die’s died down—but not completely. Even now, the fear in his eyes could still be seen.</p>
 <p>Go Die’s reaction was slightly slower than Never Die’s, but he still rushed toward Bai Yunfei for a surprise attack with his mother and son sword.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t kill him; what a shame…” Bai Yunfei lamented, but he didn’t bother fighting Go Die. Han Lin and Han Chong were still in stunned silence behind him, and Bai Yunfei didn’t feel like fighting a two on one battle.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s sigh snapped both brothers out of their stupefaction. Han Lin stared at Bai Yunfei. Bai Yunfei was roughly the same age as him and slightly more attractive to boot, but Han Lin looked as though he was seeing a ghost while he stared at Bai Yunfei. “You… this… but how! What… what the…”</p>
 <p>Han Lin’s brother was much calmer. Instead of saying anything, Han Chong looked at Bai Yunfei’s eyes with a look of disbelief.</p>
 <p>Taking two steps behind so that he could stand shoulder to shoulder with the brothers, Bai Yunfei ignored the looks they were giving him to stare at the enemy instead. “Shall we give the finishing blow to them?” He asked.</p>
 <p>A flash of light arced across Han Chong’s eyes.</p>
 <p>It took Han Chong a second to get his mind back into shape. He said, “Of course! Han Lin, let’s go!”</p>
