 <p></p>
 <p>After this earring was upgraded, a never-before-seen effect appeared!</p>
 <p>“Poison resistance?” Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up, <em>“That’s not hard to understand. I don’t know what use it’d normally have, but it could be very useful the right situations…</em></p>
 <p><em>“It’s a shame that it’s an earring. I don’t need those…”</em> Bai Yunfei sighed. As long as an item had a decent effect, Bai Yunfei don't care if it was a stud, but Bai Yunfei would never wear earrings clearly meant for women.</p>
 <p>He looked at the earring a little longer, thinking of what to do with it.</p>
 <p>It was only after he came to a conclusion that he put the earring away.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>The next morning, Bai Yunfei woke up as the morning sun was rising into the air. Last night’s upgrading session was the first in a very long time. He had used up all of his soulforce while he was upgrading, so he fell asleep as soon as he ran out.</p>
 <p>There was nothing Bai Yunfei needed to do possibly because he was a guest right now. Taking advantage of this newfound freedom, Bai Yunfei upgraded several more accessories. There weren’t any soul armaments he could upgrade, but there was still a good amount of high quality items he could make use of.</p>
 <p>If an item didn’t have a good +10 additional effect, he could still try going for the +12 effect.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, his chances of success when upgrading normal items was back to the same level as when he was a Soul Sprite. This meant that Bai Yunfei would have a much harder time upgrading the same items when his essence fireseed was fully healed.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had the luxury of not being picky, unlike when he had to find items that could increase spirit for the sake of Tang Xinyun. All sorts of accessories with all sorts of attributes could be upgraded to their limits.</p>
 <p>As he got up from his bed, Bai Yunfei thought back to his thoughts on upgrading last night. <em>“Without including the bonus points I get from my equipment, I should probably have around 7500 points of soulforce. I don’t know how much that relates to on a scale, but it’s 2000 more soulforce than when I became a Soul Ancestor. I wonder if future levels will increase in difficulty or if there’ll be some sort of ‘obstacle’ to break before becoming a mid-stage Soul Ancestor?”</em></p>
 <p>Back when he was desperate to help Tang Xinyun, Bai Yunfei knew that his soulforce was increasing with each upgrade, and since he continued to upgrade without fail during those times, he came to learn that his chances of success were back to the same rates as before. Even with his elemental fire gone, his soulforce continued to grow. He had gained some benefits from the disaster.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei made sure to not overdo it with upgrading. While Xiao Binzi was able to ‘protect’ Bai Yunfei back in Curopia City, the same guarantee didn’t apply here.</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t have elemental fire, his soulforce was still increasing. That meant he could still train.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The sound of gentle laughter outside of his room broke Bai Yunfei’s train of thought. Stepping out, he saw a group of people near him. Tang Xinyun, Zhao Xiluo, Kou Tingting, and even Chu Qingxue and Zhao Mancha were there. They were all seated around a stone table as they talked about something. Two different colored stone pieces could be seen on a board placed on the table.</p>
 <p>Go.</p>
 <p>Thanks to the memories of the transmigrator, Bai Yunfei was able to recreate several recreational games. With time, the games became commonplace in the Crafting School with even Zi Jin, Xiao Binzi, and the other elders enjoying a game or two.</p>
 <p>The board that Tang Xinyun and Kou Tingting were playing on seemed slightly different.</p>
 <p>The reason why was because the game they were playing was five-in-a-row.</p>
 <p>A far simpler but more interesting game.</p>
 <p>Back then, Bai Yunfei used these games to keep Huangfu Rui interested. Tang Xinyun had unexpectedly taken a fancy to one of the games, so Bai Yunfei made a set for her.</p>
 <p>Of course, Tang Xinyun knew more than just five-in-a-row by now. She was quite good at Go. She could sometimes beat Bai Yunfei, the ‘creator’ of the game.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei reached their table, he could hear Tang Xinyun explaining the main aspects of the game to Kou Tingting. It looked as though the two had already played a game or two with Chu Qingxue and the others listening in on the conversation with great interest.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s approach was noticed by everyone, and they turned to greet him. In turn, Bai Yunfei greeted everyone else before sitting on the remaining stone stool.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, I heard from Xinyun that your arm was injured?”</p>
 <p>Kou Tingting’s question came out of nowhere, causing Bai Yunfei to take a second to respond, “Haha,” he laughed, “I hurt myself yesterday, but it’s nothing major. It’ll heal in no time at all.”</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, you should let Tingting take a look.” Tang Xinyun advised, “Tingting said that she could help treat your arm or at least make your recovery even faster.”</p>
 <p>“Eh? Treat?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s right. Yunfei, let junior Kou take a look at you.” Zhao Xiluo laughed. “Junior Kou’s hydrotherapy is absolutely perfect. Even I’m nowhere near her level. As long as it’s not an unusual wound, she’ll be able to shorten the time needed to heal it with her treatment.”</p>
 <p>“Hydrotherapy?” Bai Yunfei curiously asked. He knew that elemental water was filled with healing aspects since many water type soul skills were usually meant for healing, but Bai Yunfei had never come across any of those himself.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei rolled his sleeves up, the state of his right arm startled everyone there.</p>
 <p>“That doesn’t look like an externally-caused wound, was it from rebound?” Zhao Xiluo inquired.</p>
 <p>“Good eyes, Xiluo. It’s the remnants of when I used a certain soul skill. It’s not as serious as it looks, so it should heal in just a few days.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Bai Yunfei’s right arm in such a state a second time caused Tang Xinyun to frown. “Tingting,” She said, “Please help Yunfei heal his arm…”</p>
 <p>Inspecting the arm, Kou Tingting gave one final smile to Tang Xinyun, “Haha, don’t worry Xinyun. Like Yunfei said, it’s not a major wound. Left by itself, his arm would heal in a few days, but let me treat it for you…”</p>
 <p>With Bai Yunfei’s consent, Kou Tingting raised her right arm. A faint blue light emanated from the tips of her jadelike fingers before spreading through her hand to her palm. Turning it over, she pressed her hand against Bai Yunfei’s right arm. She directed the flow of elemental water around his arm. Pulsating with cadence, the elemental water slowly started to enter his skin.</p>
 <p>The next second, Bai Yunfei could feel a pleasantly cool sensation run through his arm. It was unspeakably comfortable. Every last inch of his arm seemed to be rejoicing in joy as the elemental water energy started to assimilate into his body. The throbbing pain that had been present before started to ebb away, and even the bruised parts of his arm started to return to a normal color.</p>
 <p>Several minutes went by without Bai Yunfei knowing before Kou Tingting finally withdrew her arm. The blue glow of light disappeared from Bai Yunfei’s skin, revealing a completely normal arm.</p>
 <p>Slightly doubting what he was seeing, Bai Yunfei clenched his hand several times to test it out. As Bai Yunfei felt power course through his arm without any pain, he was convinced that his arm was fully back to normal.</p>
 <p>The wound that previously required several days to heal had been fully healed within minutes all thanks to Kou Tingting!</p>
 <p>“This… this is ‘hydrotherapy’? How… how amazing!”</p>
