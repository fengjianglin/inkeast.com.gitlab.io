 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

If he used it sparingly in short intervals of time, all was fine, but if he kept it running for long enough, he’d be hit with the backlash. The reason he didn’t use Berserk Mode when he first realized he was in a trap was because he had been saving it up for the most optimal time.</span></p>

He was no longer in a rational state of mind, and the amount of murderous power coming from him made him look more like a beast in the skin of a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his nature, this type of stuff shouldn’t have happened. Even if he was under extreme emotional duress, an extreme sight like this wouldn’t have happened. But as it were, there was&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">one</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;likely reason why he was like this.</span></p>

For the most part, he had ten days left to go until he was back to normal, but those were under optimal conditions and hadn’t accounted for something like this!</span></p>

His coming to Baishan City wasn’t just some sort of whimsical idea of revenge plotted by the second generational that was Cao Jun. This trap was clearly meant to specify him and kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been planning to capture Bai Yunfei from the very beginning, the kidnapping of Fang Tianmeng had only been the bait for Bai Yunfei to take!</span></p>

It was because of Bai Yunfei that Fang Tianmeng was in this mess!</span></p>

The important thing was that his student was in danger because of him!</span></p>

These despicable people were using Fang Tianmeng as a way to divert Bai Yunfei’s attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

In Bai Yunfei’s mind, there was absolutely nothing stopping him from wanting to kill everyone here!</span></p>

Somehow cleaving through the fire with his weapon, the man held a azure-blue shortblade to stab at the back of Bai Yunfei’s head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was one of the peak late-stage Soul Exalts that had been fighting Xiao Qi. But because the bird flew off to try and save Fang Tianmeng, this left this Soul Exalt free to change his target to Bai Yunfei. Because he saw how strangely Bai Yunfei was acting after being hit by the Soul King, the Soul Exalt thought it was his chance to strike. Right now, he thought Bai Yunfei had become some sort of beast at the final moments of his life, or he was even perhaps sacrificing his origin essence for a short burst of power. So he decided the best plan of action right now was to hurry up and take out Bai Yunfei before he could become a ‘problem’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had clearly not been paying attention to Bai Yunfei due to his fight with Xiao Qi. While a pre-emptive strike like this one would be considered the right choice in normal situations, what Bai Yunfei was undergoing right now was by no means a ‘normal’ situation. The ‘right’ choice this Soul Exalt chose would become a mistake that would see to him paying a heavy price for…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Five Elements theory, Water extinguishes Fire. So the Soul Exalt’s elemental water would protect the man from Bai Yunfei’s elemental fire. The high-earth tier soul armament he had would also be bolstered by the elemental water and was about to cut into Bai Yunfei, and that would be that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then, the look of joy in his face froze up for a moment before turning into shock and fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang!”</span></p>

On the other end of the blade was a single hand that held it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even see when Bai Yunfei had turned around. But right now, Bai Yunfei’s right hand was grabbing onto the blade! In that one moment the water-type Soul Exalt tried to attack with his soul armament, Bai Yunfei stopped it as if his hand was invincible—he was unharmed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the strength of the Ardent Sun Glove, there was no way a mere high-earth tier soul armament would be able to pierce it.</span></p>

His first thought was to try and pull away, but then he felt a hand grip onto his wrist. In the moment Bai Yunfei stopped the dagger, his right hand went forward to grab onto the arm holding onto the blade!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Soul Exalt felt something pull on him, forcing him to follow the momentum forward to Bai Yunfei. At first, the only thing he saw was the crimson-red eyes of Bai Yunfei and then…a fist with golden light shining from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahhh!!!!”</span></p>

He scream aloud in fear and anger as his entire body wrapped itself up in elemental water to try and protect himself from Bai Yunfei’s punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom…crack…bang!!”</span></p>

Shortly afterwards, his eyes realized that his elemental barrier had shattered when the fist broke through it. As his eyes widened at the incoming fist, he felt a sharp amount of pain, and then, nothing…</span></p>
