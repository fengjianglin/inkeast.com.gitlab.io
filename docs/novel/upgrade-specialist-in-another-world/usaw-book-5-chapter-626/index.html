 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weapons Bai Yunfei was wielding were definitely powerful, but that was the extent of it. To the eyes of the Soul Exalts, Bai Yunfei was relying on the two powerful soul armaments to make his stand. The bullets could be dodged if the mid-stage Soul Exalts focused, and as long as they got close enough to Bai Yunfei, they’d be able to kill him quite easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s eyes grew colder when he saw the three Soul Exalts come at him again. Lifting his right hand, the Fire Eagle in it fired a single bullet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hands shook slightly when he fired the Fire Eagle, prompting Bai Yunfei to store both Desert Eagles away. He hadn’t been using any of his gun-fu earlier since he felt like his arms were already close to their physical limits. Doing this much was more than enough and had already numbed his arms more than he’d like. His body right now wasn’t in the proper shape to use the Desert Eagles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t necessary, Bai Yunfei didn’t want to tax his already extremely beaten body any more than it should be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The final bullet sped towards the early-stage Soul Exalt rather than either of the two mid-stage Soul Exalts closer to Bai Yunfei. The early-stage Soul Exalt looked panicked when he saw the bullet fired at him, but then he sighed in relief. He had enough confidence in his strength dodge just one bullet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green light flooded the area beneath his feet before he leapt to the left to dodge. This way, he’d be able to dodge the bullet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then something unexpected happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bullet flew past his shoulder after he dodged, but before the Soul Exalt could do anything else, he saw the bullet make sharp turn and enter his chest from the right!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had entered the right side of his chest, meaning his heart was safe, but the bullet then immediately detonated in his chest! In an explosion of blood and gore, the person fell to the ground and died at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fire Eagle had fired a homing bullet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Bai Yunfei didn’t bother to see if the bullet even hit the early-stage Soul Exalt or not. As soon as the Desert Eagles were placed away, Bai Yunfei retrieved the Cataclysmic Seal and had it protect his body in a layer of elemental earth. The brick then glowed red before flying out from the shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two mid-stage Soul Exalts flew in the opposite direction of Bai Yunfei before unceremoniously crashing into several pieces of furniture and then to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silence descended upon the area instantly. The only ones left standing now was Bai Yunfei, Cheng Xin, and the elder protecting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who….who are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder cried out. When Bai Yunfei used the Cataclysmic Seal to protect himself, he had leaked out a bit of his soulforce to tell the elder that Bai Yunfei was a late-stage Soul Exalt! In that moment, the elder realized that his young charge had angered someone he shouldn’t have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too late to back out from this situation peacefully however, and neither did it seem like Bai Yunfei would answer his question. When Bai Yunfei pointed his finger to direct the strange soul armament again, the elder blanched. “Young master, you must flee!!” He cried out to Cheng Xin before summoning his elemental earth to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of his hands pressed against each other in front of him as he converged all of his elemental earth in front of him, erecting a two-meter thick tortoise-shell shield to stop the Cataclysmic Seal from crashing into them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin had been stunned into non action ever since the other Soul Exalts had been knocked out. The elder’s cry had snapped him out from his shock, and without further ado he began to flee in panic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin had barely even turned around to flee when he heard an explosive sound from right behind him. It was so loud and close that it hurt his ears, and then he saw the figure of a person go flying past him faster than he was running!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the elder that was meant to protect him! Blood was spilling out from the now pale-faced elder, and his arms were both bent at an awkward angle. The elder flew for a short moment before crashing through the wall of a room and onto the stone ground behind it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifyingly strong amount of soulforce crept up behind Cheng Xin right afterwards. As strong as he was as a mid-stage Soul Exalt, his strength was useless as he felt something smash heavily into his spine. Crashing into the ground, he spat out a mouthful of blood onto the spot beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pained, Cheng Xin hurried to turn onto his back when he heard footsteps approach him. Right now, Bai Yunfei was walking towards him, much to Cheng Xin’s fright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do—don’t come over!! Who are you?! How are you this strong?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei bent his head down to look at Cheng Xin. “Who am I?” He laughed, “I’m just a ‘nobody’ that lord Cheng wouldn’t even bother to pay attention to, aren’t I? You...tried to kill me just now, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin was filled with fear as Bai Yunfei drew closer to him, “What...what are you going to do?! I’m warning you, I’m...I’m the son of a minister!! If you dare hurt me, you’ll die a dog’s death! Let me go and I’ll allow you to leave in one piece!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei closed his eyes. Even now, Cheng Xin wasn’t very willing to admit his wrongs. “The son of a minister? That is indeed a huge status, but….you did try to kill me just now….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Killing intent flooded from Bai Yunfei’s eyes—he was already marking Cheng Xin down for death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Bai Yunfei did have a sliver of hesitation. Cheng Xin was indeed who he said he was, killing such a person would bring him some troubles. If people were to find out just who killed Cheng Xin, Bai Yunfei would definitely suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he were to kill Cheng Xin, then he’d have to do it without leaving behind a trace. This by extension meant….he’d have to kill every single person here! Even those ordinary men who saw Bai Yunfei walk in would have to die, else Cheng Xin’s death would still be linked back to him…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Either way, Bai Yunfei wouldn’t even bother doing that. Killing others didn’t really rank highly on Bai Yunfei’s list, and neither did Bai Yunfei enjoy taking away the lives of another….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment’s hesitation, Bai Yunfei sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d let them go. Or at least….they’d live for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even if he was sparing their lives, some reparation was still in store. Bai Yunfei stepped towards Cheng Xin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin was nervous when Bai Yunfei approached. His only saving grace was the fact that Bai Yunfei didn’t seem like he’d kill him now, but he was still terrified and shivering all over. “What….what are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teaching you a lesson to remember. In the future, you shouldn’t call for the life of another so easily. And from now on, don’t bother me or else the punishment will be ten times worse than this!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Bai Yunfei’s right foot stamped down onto Cheng Xin’s right hand!!</span></p>
