 <p>Chapter 376: Coil x Dual Dragons!!</p>
 <p>The final seal made by Bai Yunfei’s fingers preceded the change that came over the fire. Expanding in size, the flames swelled in intensity before flowing out from Bai Yunfei’s body in large amounts.</p>
 <p>Only seconds went by as the powerful aura started to stabilize. But rather than have one single strand of elemental fire, there were two! Both fluctuated with powerful elemental fire, but both had their own rhythmic differences that refused to mix with one another, thus resulting in the sight in front of Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Houuu…..”</p>
 <p>A low grumble came from the hillbeast. Somehow, there was a tinge of nervousness in its roar, and perhaps just a little bit of….fear?!</p>
 <p>“Clang! Clang! Clang….”</p>
 <p>One after another, resonating sounds of elemental earth being gathered clamored all over the hillbeast’s ‘body’. The area where Bai Yunfei was had the most elemental earth bubbling in it, and before long, stalagmites even bigger and more numerous than the ones before started to fly towards Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>“Bzzz…..”</p>
 <p>For just one brief moment, the hillbeast came to a stop admist a very loud buzz. Countless of stone spikes came flying out from its body and through the air at frightening speeds, threatening to cover every single inch of area Bai Yunfei could possibly escape to in larger numbers than before!</p>
 <p>But Bai Yunfei was already finishing up the very last of the hand seals by this point. Upon the very final one, Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up excitedly before he brought his hands to his side so that they were at forty-five degree angles to his side. Clenching tightly, the two streams of elemental fire started to bubble and flow through his left and right arms. As they flowed, they started to coil around his arms and then converge at his fists like forming a bubble.</p>
 <p>“Bang….bang….”</p>
 <p>The rhythmic beating of the two fireseed essences within his body brought a light to Bai Yunfei’s eyes. At times, the fireseeds would flow forward, and in other times, it’d flow backwards, like it was following a pulsating tempo. As if two dragons were rising up within him, the elemental fire exploded in power, threatening to tear loose from his body with a roar to fill the area with its terrifying strength.</p>
 <p>The whistling of the stone spikes coming from the hillbeast was almost continuous. Shooting one after another, each stone spike was mixed with each other so closely that it was more like a fluid stream of spikes. Not a single gap could be seen in between the spikes, and with the orange glow infusing them, the entire thing looked like a giant stone dragon threatening to swallow Bai Yunfei whole!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was unswayed by this attack. Even with how threatening it looked, Bai Yunfei stared unflinchingly at it with the elemental fire still rising in intensity with each passing second….</p>
 <p>“This is it, here we go!”</p>
 <p>Finally, Bai Yunfei let loose an angry roar. The burning fire wrapped around his arms shook, and with a final bang, his arms thrusted forward!!</p>
 <p>In the moment his arms punched out, the two streams of elemental fire charged forth. They extended from his fists as one long stream a meter thick and still growing in length to howl and roar furiously, and to the hillbeast, it surely looked as though two giant fire dragons were coming straight at it!!</p>
 <p>By twenty meters, the two fire dragons blasted into the barrage of stone spikes. Upon the union of the two, the two streams started to twist and turn around each other! The resulting explosion was extremely fierce, and the fires and stones that sloughed off the two was extremely terrifying to look at!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!”</p>
 <p>Another explosion rocked the area as the two dragons vied for supremacy. One red, and one orange fought fiercely for some time before finally, one side won over the other.</p>
 <p>In a final burst of fire, the two red dragons joined together to become one giant flame pillar and devoured the earth dragon whole!</p>
 <p>When the two sides first struck against each other, the stone dragon looked as though it had the advantage at first.</p>
 <p>But when the two fire dragons joined together, the earth dragon was vanquished almost instantly!! With the earth dragon defeated, any stone spikes that were far enough away from the dragon fell to the ground, while those stones still intact in the fire dragon fell down in the form of lava to pour down onto the ground like rain!</p>
 <p>Even with the prior clash, the fire dragon hadn’t slowed down in speed at all. Separating again into two, the fire dragons rotated in place as they traveled through the air, the intensity of the heat was actually growing stronger and stronger…..with nothing that could stop its indomitable force!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!” Following a small explosion of stone and rubble, the two fire dragons slammed straight into the hillbeast’s waist!! So ear-deafening was the explosion that even the earth beneath the hillbeast shook with sound! The two fire dragons colliding with the hillbeast had been so brilliant in light that it felt as though the sun itself was emitting a bright red light with fires that spread across the entire mountain in a flash!</p>
 <p>Like a bonfire, the entirety of the hillbeast’s body was engulfed into flames!</p>
 <p>This powerful move of Bai Yunfei had a name.</p>
 <p>The Dual Dragons!!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Faced with such a powerful force attacking him, the hillbeast came to a sudden and complete stop for the very first time!</p>
 <p>“Whew….” On top of his Tempest Sword, Bai Yunfei let out a sigh of relief when he saw the hillbeast had stopped moving. Of all the times he practiced this one move, today’s usage had been the best so far!</p>
 <p><em>“Just as I thought, it takes a real fight to really see me at my best. What a huge improvement this was…..”</em> He remarked while rubbing his hands.</p>
 <p>“Houuuu!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a loud roar of a soulbeast brought Bai Yunfei out from his thoughts. Stunned that the hillbeast could still move, Bai Yunfei looked down at wide eyes to see the flaming mountain start moving again towards him!</p>
 <p><em>“It...it can still move?!”</em> He screamed to himself, <em>“But how….but how?!”</em></p>
 <p>The power behind his Dual Dragons was by no means weak, and Bai Yunfei had been confident in its ability to accomplish its task. So while he muttered to himself about the hillbeast, a wave of indignation and fury washed over his eyes. Giving a death glare at the hillbeast, Bai Yunfei began to go through another series of hand seals while saying, “I doubt you won’t go down, take this! Dual Fla—”</p>
 <p>“Hou….”</p>
 <p>Right as Bai Yunfei was about to activate the second form of the Dual Flame Arts, the hillbeast let loose another roar. But this time, it was far weaker in tone, and filled with pain and anguish!</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Pausing in his hand seals, Bai Yunfei gave a closer look at the struggling hillbeast on the ground. For twenty seconds the hillbeast continued to struggle, but at the second after that, it came to a pause. Two seconds later, it faltered, and then right under Bai Yunfei’s eyes, the mountain peaks on its body….collapsed!!</p>
 <p>It was like if an actual mountain was crumbling. Piece by piece, the hillbeast’s body crumbled and gave way like in a landslide. The body that must’ve took the hillbeast so many years to form was ultimately reduced to stone!</p>
 <p>“I….” Even after several seconds passed from when the aura of the hillbeast vanished, Bai Yunfei didn’t talk.</p>
 <p>As things appeared, the hillbeast had been in is final death throes from when Bai Yunfei’s Dual Dragons smashed into it!</p>
 <p>“Haha! So that’s how it is! I’ve said it before, but as long as I’ve the Dual Dragons in this ‘coil’ form, a mid-stage class six soulbeast is no match for me!!”</p>
 <p>With a hearty laugh, Bai Yunfei stared at the ‘corpse’ of the hillbeast. Knowing that time was just about up, Bai Yunfei released the ‘coil’ form with a slap of his hand to his chest, expelling the second fireseed from it back into the Cataclysmic Seal.</p>
 <p>Once the form fully dissipated away from Bai Yunfei, his power levels dropped straight back down to that of a late-stage Soul Ancestor. The drop of strength had always left Bai Yunfei feeling dissatisfied since he could feel the powerful soulforce drain away from him.</p>
 <p>The Violet Soul Ring on his right hand flashed once, signifying the activation of its effects to transfer its stockpiled 2000 soulpoints back into Bai Yunfei’s body and restoring his reserves back to a workable state.</p>
 <p>Still standing on his sword, Bai Yunfei looked over the entire area to where the Soulbeast Forest was. The ‘path’ left behind by the hillbeast had dug a hundred meter ditch in the ground behind it and ruined all the trees in sight.</p>
 <p>But no other soulbeasts were in sight either.</p>
 <p>He looked to the west of the Soulbeast Forest; no soulbeasts were coming out from that direction as well.</p>
 <p>It would seem that the soulbeast wave was coming to an end….</p>
 <p>He let out a sigh of relief. “Phew….it’s finally over, I wonder how the guild wil—”</p>
 <p>“Roar!!!!”</p>
 <p>Just as he was about to turn back to the direction of the Braves guild, the ear-piercing roar of a beast suddenly forced him to pause!</p>
 <p>This sound wasn’t coming from the front, but from the...back!!</p>
