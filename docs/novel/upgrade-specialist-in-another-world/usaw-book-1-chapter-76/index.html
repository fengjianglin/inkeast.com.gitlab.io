 <p>Chapter 76: Injury Treatment</p>
 <p>Just when Mu Wanqing and You Qingfeng were talking about Bai Yunfei, a disciple suddenly came to report that the person who had informed them of the situation in the afternoon on behalf of Bai Yunfei had come over to pay a visit.</p>
 <p>“He?” Mu Wanqing frowned slightly, seeming to be somewhat puzzled.</p>
 <p>You Qingfeng also said somewhat doubtfully, “What has he come here for? Could it be because of Bai Yunfei? But according to my earlier analysis, there shouldn’t be a very close connection between them...”</p>
 <p>Mu Wanqing looked in the direction of the main gate, saying, “No matter what, since he already came here, I think I’d better go and welcome him. I feel that he...”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I know what you want to say. I also have that kind of feeling. As long as he has no bad intentions, we’ll receive him properly. There’s nothing wrong with this.” You Qingfeng said with a nod.</p>
 <p>They both turned around and walked towards the gate again.</p>
 <p>Hong Yin was standing with a smiling expression at the main gate. Seeing the two of them walking over, he folded his hands rather apologetically, saying, “Please excuse my sudden visit, headmaster Mu. I would like to stay in your school for several days. Hopefully you will allow me to do so.”</p>
 <p>Hong Yin’s straightforwardness surprised Mu Wanqing. She then said smilingly, “You don’t have to stand on ceremony, young hero. Now that you’ve come here to be a guest, my school will certainly welcome you. Right, what’s your name, young hero?”</p>
 <p>“Hong Yin.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, young hero Hong Yin, it’s already evening so you’d better have a rest first. Is it okay if I tell someone to take you to a guest room next to Bai Yunfei’s?” Mu Wanqing said.</p>
 <p>Hong Yin folded his hands to her again, saying, “In that case, thank you very much, headmaster Mu.”</p>
 <p>After watching Hong Yin walk away under the guidance of a disciple, Mu Wanqing turned to looked at You Qingfeng and saw him frowning slightly, seeming to be pondering about something.</p>
 <p>“Qingfeng, are you okay?”</p>
 <p>You Qingfeng looked in the direction where Hong Yin had disappeared and said somewhat doubtfully, “Hong Yin... I seem to have heard this name somewhere before. But for the moment I can’t remember when this happened...”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Could it be he’s an outstanding disciple of a certain school or family?” Mu Wanqing asked in bewilderment.</p>
 <p>You Qingfeng pondered again for some time but still could not remember it. He then shook his head gently and gave up thinking, saying, “No matter who he is, at least both of us can tell that he’s definitely more powerful than us. Only, he’s hiding it so well we’re simply unable to know his power level, which also means he must be much stronger than us... It’s best to make friends with this kind of person. Even if this is impossible, we should try as hard as we can not to offend him. I think he seems to think quite highly of Bai Yunfei, but for what reason...?”</p>
 <p>“Mm, I’m pretty curious about this too.” Mu Wanqing said with a nod, “Given his power, it would have been as easy as turning his hand for him to resolve the problem for Bai Yunfei, but it seems Bai Yunfei didn’t want to owe him too much at all so he had no choice but to help him a bit by giving us a message, letting us go and rescue him. I feel that there shouldn’t be a very deep relationship between them. At least Bai Yunfei is still unfamiliar with him, but somehow he cares about Bai Yunfei quite a lot...”</p>
 <p>You Qingfeng shook his head gently, saying laughingly, “Don’t think about it too much, Wanqing. There’s not much point in guessing either. Now that he’s staying here, this is beneficial to us. If that Glacial School really comes here to make trouble, maybe he’ll get into action. In that case, we’ll have less to worry about, right?”</p>
 <p>“Mm, you’re right. Now let’s just wait for the Glacial School’s reaction. When the time comes, we’ll act according to the situation...”</p>
 <p>............</p>
 <p>In a guest room in a small courtyard house on the west wing, Bai Yunfei was sitting on the bed in a somewhat preoccupied manner. However, he did not seem to be treating his injuries at all. It was impossible to know what he was thinking about.</p>
 <p>“Knock knock knock...” Sounds of knocking rang out. Startled, Bai Yunfei hurriedly said, “Just come in.”</p>
 <p>The door was pushed open and Qiu Luliu and Chu Yuhe entered the room. The latter was even holding a large bowl of liquid medicine in her hands. She carefully walked up to Bai Yunfei, handed the bowl to him and said in a deeply concerned manner, “Brother Yunfei, please drink this medicine quickly. It’ll help you in treating your injuries. In a while you should channel your soulforce to digest the medicinal properties and you’ll recover very soon.”</p>
 <p>As Bai Yunfei looked at the two of them, his eyes showed that he was moved by their kindness. He received the bowl, drank it up in several gulps then handed it back to Yuhe, saying laughingly: “Thank you very much. You don’t have worry about me. I’m alright. I’ll get well very soon.”</p>
 <p>Qiu Luliu nodded to him, “Mm, I know you’re not so weak. Now you should treat your injuries properly. We won’t disturb you anymore. If you need something, just look for us in Willow Leave House on the left of this courtyard house.”</p>
 <p>After saying so, she pulled Chu Yuhe gently and both of them walked out of the room.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei gazed at the door in stupefaction for a while again. Eventually he gave a soft sigh, concentrated his attention then sat with legs crossed and began to examine the injuries in his body carefully.</p>
 <p>Leaving aside the injuries he had suffered in the beginning when fighting those two mid-stage Soul Warriors, he had been hit by Liu Cheng’s Glacial Palm twice. With the first time, he was well prepared for taking the blow. But with the second time, he was hit in the back while running away. Although at the time Liu Cheng had suddenly changed his move and did not use all his power because of this, the blow still inflicted extremely serious damage on Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>His internal organs were slightly injured, his front ribs seemed to be cracked as well, and moreover, there was an icy-cold stream of energy moving wantonly in his body. Wherever it went, it made his hair at that place stand on end and slowed his perception there down by half a second. Bai Yunfei had tried channeling his soulforce to block its way, but achieved minimal results.</p>
 <p>In frustration, he had no choice but to took the Fire-tipped Spear out and diverted its scorching heat into his body. Only by doing this was he finally able to slowly neutralize that icy-cold energy.</p>
 <p>“This won’t do... Though I seem to be able to neutralize this cold energy this way, this kind of situation has happened before. I thought I understood it clearly, but last time, if not for senior Ge’s help, I would have ended up in a bad situation. This time, maybe there’s also the elemental force of ice that I can’t detect inside my body. But I simply have no way to know... Must I ask someone to help me? Perhaps headmaster Mu or that senior You can help me get rid of this cold energy, but I really don’t want to owe them another debt of gratitude...”</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, he decided to temporarily stop pondering about this ‘hidden danger’&nbsp; and heal the injuries he could heal now first.</p>
 <p>............</p>
 <p>In the early morning of the next day, when the sunlight came into the room, Bai Yunfei also opened his eyes slowly then breathed out softly. His expression looked much better now than before. It seemed he had recovered well.</p>
 <p>He put the Fire-tipped Spear placed horizontally on his legs away into his space ring, kneaded his fists and nodded in a rather satisfied manner, “The bowl of medicine Yuhe gave me really worked wonders. If I had only used my soulforce to make my body recover, it would have been half as effective at best. Judging from my current condition, it’ll take me three days at most to fully recover.”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, sounds of knocking rang out and Yuhe’s tender voice came in, “Brother Yunfei, have you woken up? I have brought breakfast for you.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I already got up. Just come in, Yuhe.”</p>
 <p>The door was pushed open gently and Yuhe walked in holding a bowl of congee. She smiled at Bai Yunfei, put the bowl down on the table and said, “Are you feeling better now, brother Yunfei?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei shook his head smilingly, saying, “Mm, I’ve already got much better. In two more days, I should be able to fully recover. You don’t have to worry, Yuhe.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s good. You should eat some congee first then continue to treat your injuries. You can also go out for a stroll and breathe some fresh air.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, thank you very much, Yuhe. If I need something, I will let you know.” Bai Yunfei nodded and said.</p>
 <p>“Then... I won’t disturb your injury treatment anymore, brother Yunfei. I’ll bring you another meal at noon.”</p>
 <p>After watching Chu Yuhe go away, Bai Yunfei ate the congee then sat back on the bed and cultivated his soulforce for some time. But he always felt somewhat uneasy and could not focus his mind. Frustrated, he had no choice but to decide to go for a stroll outside to see if he could relax his mind a bit.</p>
 <p>After getting out of the room, he looked around. This was a small courtyard house consisting of five rooms. Outside the house, there was a small road paved with stone slabs. Both sides of the road were full of grass and flowers of various colors, and they were swaying gently in the wind. At first sight, they were rather pleasing to both the eye and the mind.</p>
 <p>Just when Bai Yunfei wanted to walk out to have a look, a person turned into the courtyard from the right-hand side of the gate. As soon as they saw each other’s face, Bai Yunfei was totally surprised, but that person just smiled at him.</p>
 <p>“Hong Yin!” Bai Yunfei said in amazement, “Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Hong Yin said laughingly, “What? I can’t be here?”</p>
 <p>“Er, no, what I mean is, could it be you’re a member of the Green Willow School?” Bai Yunfei asked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“Is someone who stays in the Green Willow School necessarily a member of this school? You’re also staying here, aren’t you? Ha ha, I’ve only come here to stay for a few nights.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked at him seriously. Without avoiding his eyes, Hong Yin also looked at him smilingly. Bai Yunfei withdrew his eyes then said after pondering for some time, “Why did you help me like that? We should... should have no relationship with each other, right?”</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, correct. Before yesterday, we didn’t even know about each other.” Hong Yin nodded, “But you don’t need to be suspicious either. At least I’ve got no bad intentions towards you, right?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that there was still a doubtful look in Bai Yunfei’s eyes, Hong Yin could not help saying, “Alright, I can tell you more. I know that there’s some connection between you and the Fate School. Plus, senior Ge Yiyun personally looked for you. So I want to make friends with you. Perhaps later we’ll be able to help each other...”</p>
 <p>“How can I help you? You’re much more powerful than me. Is there really anything I can help you with?”</p>
 <p>“Now that’s indeed the case, but who can say for sure what will happen later?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei considered frowningly for a while then said sincerely, “I have to thank you very much for your help, no matter what. Yesterday, if not for you, I wouldn’t have been able to make my decision so easily.”</p>
 <p>In that alleyway yesterday, Hong Yin had told Bai Yunfei that when he had been in the Secret Pleasure Tower that day, Liu Cheng had been watching him in the dark. Moreover, he also warned him that Liu Cheng and Liu Meng beside him looked somewhat alike.</p>
 <p>It was only thanks to his warnings was Bai Yunfei able to link his suspicions together then decide to ‘show his cards’ first. He also looked for Hong Yin in advance and requested him to carry a message to the Green Willow School, asking it to send people to help him.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, it’s good that you can believe me, little brother Yunfei. In fact, people should treat each other sincerely. There’s nothing wrong with being a little cautious, but if you’re too suspicious and skeptical, you’ll appear somewhat cold and aloof, right?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Hong Yin’s words, Bai Yunfei was slightly taken aback. He folded his hands and said with a hint of embarrassment on his face, “This... Thank you very much for your advice, brother Hong Yin.”</p>
