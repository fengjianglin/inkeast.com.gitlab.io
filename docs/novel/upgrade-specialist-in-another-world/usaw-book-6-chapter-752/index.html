<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the small ravine, Bai Yunfei and Yue Feng were still battling the people ambushing them. Despite the superiority of their strengths, getting rid of these people wasn’t as easy as a snap of the fingers. The enemies were after all either Late-stage Soul Exalts or Peak Late-stage Soul Exalts in strength. People who managed to make it this far are all people with a large amount of experience gained from battle. In situations where life and death was split only by one small line, experience was a huge deciding factor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Feng had only managed to get rid of the Late-stage Soul Exalt because of the element of surprise. After the battle had truly begun, Yue Feng was busy juggling the gray-robed man and his soulbeast partner. Bai Yunfei had to deal with two other soul cultivators and a soulbeast by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long to see that Bai Yunfei and Yue Feng had the upper hand in the battle despite having the fewer numbers. Whether it was in their movement, defense, or offense, they were beyond any of the enemies. In just twenty minutes, the two were hardly injured while the others were more than lightly injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! Who are these guys? How are they so strong?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gray-robed man cried out as he lashed out with a punch onto Yue Feng’s shoulder. It collided and knocked Yue Feng back, but then he was struck with an elbow and sent flying away several meters. If not for his soulbeast partner attacking from the side, he would’ve been struck by Yue Feng’s leg to the face. Steadying himself, the man watched as his soulbeast partner tried its best to attack Yue Feng with a pained expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soulbeast partner was a luminous tiger. As a metal-type soulbeast, it was capable of producing eye-blinding light that made visibility almost impossible. Offense and defense wise, the tiger was very strong, and whenever Yue Feng landed a leg or fist onto it, there was always something akin to a metallic clang from its skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an annoyed look on Yue Feng’s face as he fought with the tiger. He had wanted to finish this battle in a hurry, but he had yet to actually finish off anyone else. Nearly half an hour had already passed since the battle began, and his patience was running thin. Murderous with annoyance, Yue Feng was no longer willing to try and just knock out these people. In order to get to Nangong Yuexia and Yu Li sooner rather than later, he’d simply use his soul skill to kill these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes widened as if sensing something. Head snapping off into a random direction, Yue Feng’s face paled with anxiety!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crap!!! Yuexia’s in trouble!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Feng’s face was of fright and anxiety as he communicated with the brown bear through their soul bond. The warning signals he was getting from it was telling him that Nangong Yuexia was with the brown bear, and that they were both in danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t any signal from the bear before that they were in danger, so Yue Feng hadn’t been too worried beforehand. But now that this was the case, Yue Feng was more worried than before. And because of that worry, he inadvertently let himself open to an attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Realizing his chance, the gray-robed man leapt forward. A golden sword appeared in his hand for him to lash at Yue Feng’s head. The tiger roared and pounced to attack at that spot as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yue Feng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had Yue Feng in his sights due to their positioning, so he was in prime position to see what was going on, and to call out a warning in advance to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang!! Tzzzzzkt…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was the sound of metal hitting metal and fabric being torn as Yue Feng bolted into action. Bai Yunfei’s warning had given him enough time to bring out a dazzling violet sword to block the other sword and leap out of the way just in time to dodge the tiger’s claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t managed to dodge the claws completely. The fabric on the back of his robes was torn to shreds and sparks were sent flying as the tiger’s claws raked against the armor underneath. Yue Feng wasn’t hurt, but the blow was enough to send him away several steps with a pale face. The claws had done a number on him with the concussive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard, you can f*ck off now!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furious at the state he was in, Yue Feng waved his right hand with furious aplomb and a burning gaze!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crack!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A clap of thunder and a violet bolt of lightning struck the sword Yue Feng was holding. Raising the sword, he sliced across the body of the luminous tiger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aooo!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pained howl echoed through the ravine as the tiger was surrounded by a net of violet lightning. A scorch mark was on the right side of its waist as it started to roll around the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Bai! Something’s happening over there, I have to hurry over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even caring for the gray-robed person or the tiger after he struck it, Yue Feng turned to Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was at that time slamming a fist onto a Late-stage Soul Exalt sneaking behind him. Swinging his Flameblade Bracer, he the other soul cultivator and soulbeast on his right looked away from him and glanced over to Yue Feng. He nodded. “That’s fine. You go ahead, I’ll take care of these people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks! Be careful now then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even as nervous as he was, Yue Feng nodded in thanks to Bai Yunfei. Now with a new goal, Yue Feng turned away from the people there and took off towards the other side of the ravine, traveling fast enough that not even his person could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>

Most of them had already given up almost on winning against the two and were in the middle of considerations if they should run away or not when Yue Feng decided to ‘abandon’ his comrade and leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a chance for them! The despair that had previously been in their eyes were now replaced with hope.</span></p>

They had a chance to win!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The luminous tiger was only just rising back to its feet now. Ready to fight once again, the gray-robed man’s eyes lit up with determination. He glanced over to his two other comrade without hesitation, “Kill him!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Soul Exalts and two class six soulbeasts all leapt towards Bai Yunfei in one great attempt to kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s right hand was a blur as he shook it.
