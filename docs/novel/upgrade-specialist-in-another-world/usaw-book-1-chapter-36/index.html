 <p>Chapter 36: +13 Brick! Stunning! And Confusing!</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei saw that Li Chengfeng’s face was full of excitement, the corners of his mouth twitched in an unnatural manner.</p>
 <p><em>“Hopefully... all the effects will be tested soon...”</em> He prayed to himself in his mind.</p>
 <p>After the two of them positioned themselves well, Li Chengfeng continued to hit Bai Yunfei’s forehead gently with the brick again and again<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>his face full of expectation.</p>
 <p>When the third blow landed, Bai Yunfei suddenly felt a strange force surge into his head. Before he could react, he felt a wave of dizziness. Suddenly there was only an expanse of golden light before his eyes and he ended up seeing stars. His mind was in chaos and the defense of the skin and flesh on his forehead, which had been reinforced with soulforce, also disappeared in the blink of an eye. He took two steps backwards uncontrollably and was about to topple.</p>
 <p>When Li Chengfeng smashed the brick down this time, he felt a strand of soulforce flow into it in an uncontrolled manner. Then he saw Bai Yunfei retreat continuously with unfocused eyes and about to fall down. He hurriedly grabbed his shoulder to help him regain his balance and asked in a somewhat frightened manner, “Yunfei? Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>By the time he finished his questions, Bai Yunfei had already recovered. He shook his head, stood upright again and said “I’m alright” before immersing himself in contemplation.</p>
 <p>“Chengfeng, just now how long was I in this stunned state?” A while later, Bai Yunfei lifted his head and asked.</p>
 <p>“Stunned? Ah, a very short time, only about three seconds...” Li Chengfeng was stupefied then answered after thinking for a bit.</p>
 <p>“Three seconds! But the stunning effect can last for a maximum of five seconds, so in other words, the duration of this effect varies according to the target... In this case, if the target is a bit more powerful than me, he can only be stunned for one second, or even half a second... However, at that level, even half a second of stun would be enough for me to turn the tide in combat...” Bai Yunfei muttered to himself while pondering with glittering eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing the doubtful and concerned look in Li Chengfeng’s eyes upon raising his head, he said laughingly,&nbsp;“Don’t worry. I’m okay. I’ll answer the questions in your mind in detail soon. There’s still one thing that needs to be tested. Let’s continue.”</p>
 <p>“Er... continue? Alright, I’ll wait for your explanations.” Li Chengfeng said while nodding in a frustrated manner.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Bai Yunfei experienced the hurling effect twice and experienced both the hurling effect and the stunning effect simultaneously once before finally experiencing the anticipated confusing effect.</p>
 <p>The moment this effect was triggered, what Bai Yunfei was seeing suddenly distorted and his mind was in confusion, as if many things had been crammed into it all of a sudden. However, this was not as serious as being stunned because he could still control his body and the soulforce in it, but he also felt a severe lack of coordination.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, he walked forwards half a step and tried reaching out his hand to Li Chengfeng in front of him, but caught nothing.</p>
 <p>This strange feeling then disappeared and the world before his eyes returned to normal. Bai Yunfei suddenly noticed that at some point he himself had already moved to a place about two steps away from Li Chengfeng on Li Chengfeng’s left-hand side. But he was not facing Li Chengfeng either. Instead, he had turned right.</p>
 <p>“Are you okay, Yunfei? What happened just now? Why did you suddenly seem to lose your sense of direction?” Li Chengfeng walked up to his face and asked in a curious manner.</p>
 <p>“I’m okay...” Bai Yunfei shook his head then lowered it to ponder again.</p>
 <p>“This is the ‘confusing’ effect, right? It’s similar to stun, but there’s also an obvious difference...”</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, what are you thinking? Do I still have to hit you?” Seeing no reaction from Bai Yunfei for a long time, Li Chengfeng could not help asking.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei raised his head to take a look at him and scolded jokingly, “Are you addicted to hitting? Don’t hit me again. I’m already done with my research. Just give me the brick.”</p>
 <p>“Oh...” Li Chengfeng handed the brick over to Bai Yunfei in a somewhat unwilling manner with a disappointed expression on his face.</p>
 <p>The corners of his mouth twitching, Bai Yunfei put the brick away, not knowing whether to cry or laugh about this. He then sat down and said, “Alright, now I’m going to answer all your questions.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Li Chengfeng immediately became interested. He sat down next to him and asked with a face full of curiosity, “Good, good, quickly tell me what happened. How can this brick be so marvelous? Right... Now that I think about it, the two daggers you gave me seem to be quite special as well. I feel they’re similar to this brick...”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei nodded, “Correct, the two daggers I gave you, this brick, and my Fire-tipped Spear and Glacial Piercer, they all have at least one ‘special effect’.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” Li Chengfeng showed that he did not understand.</p>
 <p>“Er... they are a kind of effect that is totally out of the ordinary and unimaginable.” Bai Yunfei felt silent for a short while, but he really did not know how he should explain so he had no choice but to give an example, “Take the brick just now for example. Do you think that kind effect which mysteriously sends people flying is in the ordinary? There are also your two daggers. The effect of one of them is ‘attacks have a 2% chance of slowing the target’s speed for 10 seconds’. Do you still remember the first time we teamed up and killed that hallmaster Zhong? In the end, it was only because you triggered this effect were we able to kill him.”</p>
 <p>Seeing a pondering expression appear on Li Chengfeng’s face, Bai Yunfei continued, “The other dagger can reduce the recovery speeds of the wounds caused by it. And my Fire-tipped Spear has an explosion effect. In fact, these weapons themselves didn’t possess the effects. I am the one who ‘gave’ them the effects. I’ve got a special ability which causes them to possess these special effects... Now, do you understand after I explained it this way?”</p>
 <p>“I... still don’t understand the specifics.” Li Chengfeng shook his head confusedly, “But simply speaking, you have an unimaginable ability which added extra, unimaginable effects to these things, right?”</p>
 <p>“Er... that’s right. Your summary is very accurate.” Bai Yunfei said with a nod after thinking for a while.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this...” Li Chengfeng was not so astounded or curious as Bai Yunfei had thought. Instead, he pondered calmly for sometime before saying again, “This should be your secret, right?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was stupefied then answered, “Yeah, until now, you’re the first and also the only person who knows this secret of mine.”</p>
 <p>“Um, I got it. Don’t worry, Yunfei. I definitely won’t tell anyone about this secret.” Li Chengfeng said resolutely after falling silent again for a while.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei smiled and hit his shoulder with a punch, saying, “Of course I wouldn’t have let you know about it if I didn’t trust you. Why did you give me such a guarantee as if I don’t trust you?”</p>
 <p>The two of them then chatted for some time about the various effects of the weapons. Li Chengfeng was obviously very curious about this. He even almost failed to resist the urge to take out those two upgraded daggers and cut himself to personally experience their effects. However, Bai Yunfei did not mention the specific details of the Upgrade Technique because they were too difficult to explain. And Li Chengfeng did not ask about them either.</p>
 <p>“Right, Chengfeng, can you take a trip to Talus City tomorrow?” Bai Yunfei said to Li Chengfeng, seeming to have suddenly thought of something.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Go to Talus City? What do you want me do?” Li Chengfeng asked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>“You go there and buy some daggers. ‘Cause you already decided to use the dagger as your weapon of choice, I’ll make two powerful daggers for you!”</p>
 <p>“Really? Very good! I’ll go there tomorrow!” Li Chengfeng agreed in excitement, his eyes brightening.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, just go to the ‘Treasure Weapon Shop’, the largest weapon store in the city. It has the best weapons, and you’ll have to buy top-quality ones. Take this money, buy as many as possible and bring them back.” Bai Yunfei handed a moneybag over to him. After hesitating for a while, he continued,&nbsp;“When you’re in the city... observe if there’s any news about me, but be careful so that you won’t make somebody notice you.”</p>
 <p>Without ceremony, Li Chengfeng received the moneybag and put it away in his space ring. Hearing what Bai Yunfei said towards the end, he was stupefied and slightly frowned, but this only lasted for a moment. Afterwards, he seemed to have thought of something and his expression returned to normal. He said with a nod, “Okay, I got it. I’ll be careful.”</p>
