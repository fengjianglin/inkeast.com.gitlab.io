 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a special soul skill that affected the very depths of a person’s soul. The Soul Anchoring Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time Bai Yunfei used the soul skill, and on a Late-stage Soul King to boot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thanks to Berserk Mode, Bai Yunfei was now as strong as a Late-stage Soul King. This was incredible in itself, but there was a slight flaw to it. Bai Yunfei was strong considering his strength and soulforce due to Berserk Mode, but the strength of his own soul was not of the same level. Compared to Li Fenghai who was twenty years or so his senior as a Late-stage Soul King, Bai Yunfei’s soul was just weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something aiding Bai Yunfei when he used the Soul Anchoring Technique. For the first time since he used it, the Soul Sentinel Scarf had a faint pulsation of energy emitting from it! Before Bai Yunfei would use the Charm Bracelet’s additional effect for a pseudo-soul attack and the Soul Sentinel Scarf would usually aid in its strength, if by barely. Never had the Soul Sentinel Scarf have a reaction like this to a soul attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">+12 Additional effect of the Soul Sentinel Scarf: 200% Increase in spirit-based attacks.</span></p>

Now, Bai Yunfei’s soul was strong enough to compare with Li Fenghai and thus how his Soul Anchoring Technique was able to spearhead through Li Fenghai’s mental defenses!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Bai Yunfei had one more factor that led to his great success: timing. He had activated the Soul Anchoring Technique at the right time when Li Fenghai was still surprised about his new strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was about a moment between when Li Fenghai teleported onto the scene and when he was hit with the Soul Anchoring Technique, but after that moment, the man was completely transfixed! He stood straight to attention and his eyes looked listless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A transparent bubble covered his entire person a moment later like a capsule before he too, was whisked away into thin air just like Gui Wei had been!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashed with light as he reached a hand up into the air. “Xiao Qi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Coming!” Xiao Qi chirped in response. Swooping down, his eyes made contact with Bai Yunfei before the both of them disappeared into thin air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Left where Bai Yunfei was standing was just a small black stone now. Before it could fall from the skies, Long Lan grabbed onto the stone before retreating with the permafrost mastiff to stand alert for anything else.</span></p>

His body trembled once as the Soul Anchoring Technique wore off, allowing Li Fenghai full control of his body once again. The very first thing he did as soon as he resumed control was to erect a barrier of black energy around his person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a defensive measure that’d allow him some time to scan the area. To his immediate shock, this place looked nothing like where he used to be!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An illusion?”</span></p>

But when the black energy around him didn’t seem to register anything, he thought twice about it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It isn’t an illusion? Then this place is…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Yunfei!”</span></p>

As soon as he saw the man, his right hand flew up to fire a black bolt of energy at him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black bolt of energy didn’t even travel far before Li Fenghai gave a small start. Confused, he stared at the bolt, unsure of what to make of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bolt of energy he sent was barely as thick as the arm of a newborn baby and barely as fast as normal. He could tell that this attack wasn’t as strong as he’d normally be capable of…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally, he’d fire off a bolt of energy and allow for it to pull in on the elemental darkness in the area to fuel itself and grow even stronger and faster. It’d be over for any normal person if they were hit by it, and the bolt of energy would normally overtake anyone in speed if they tried to outrun it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this bolt of energy had already traveled for several hundred meters without at all increasing in size than when it started out. It looked like it wasn’t even pulling in any energy at all…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though slower than expected, the bolt soon arrived in front of Bai Yunfei shortly afterward. Narrowing his eyes, Bai Yunfei used the Flash Step to widen the distance just enough for the bolt to pass by his clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that wasn’t all to the bolt of energy. When it passed by Bai Yunfei, Li Fenghai bent the same finger the bolt came out from.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having caught sight of that action, Bai Yunfei immediately surrounded himself in a bonfire of intense elemental fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Li Fenghai bent his finger, the bolt of energy followed suit and turned to fire back at Bai Yunfei’s back! It impacted against the elemental fire barrier Bai Yunfei had at full force with the majority of it evaporating after impact, but a tenth of the bolt still managed to make it through to hit Bai Yunfei on the back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei snarled at the pain from the impact. His internal organs were groaning under the pain as a sliver of the black energy drove itself into his body. It looked as if the black energy was trying to spear straight through him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t look like there was a scratch from where the black bolt slammed into his armor, but Bai Yunfei’s face paled a bit after it hit him. He stumbled back several steps before steadying himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s fine?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Bai Yunfei merely stumble after being hit by his move was stunning to Li Fenghai. This move—while seemingly simple at a glance—was actually a heaven-tier soul skill! It was known as the ‘Soul Piercing Shadow Arrow’ and could pierce through a person’s soul after they were hit to inflict massive damage to it! But Bai Yunfei looked as if a mosquito had bitten him at the very most and not at all worse for wear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qi, you should get back.” Bai Yunfei warned his companion as he circulated his soulforce in preparation to battle the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The move had actually done a small number to him, much to Bai Yunfei’s surprise. Luckily, he had the Soul Sentinel Scarf protecting him for the most part, so the move didn’t do too much damage to him other provide a potential worrying moment if Li Fenghai had decided to follow up on that move.</span></p>

The Ardent Sun Glove on it began to light up with an intense amount of light before firing off a twenty-meter large fireball at the other person!</span></p>

The second fireball he shot was already catching up with the first, and in no time at all, nine fireballs had been fired in total!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!”</span></p>

He raised his right hand where a small ball of dark light was forming. The ball soon started to pick up in rotational speed as more and more elemental darkness gathered within it. But even as more energy gathered, the size of the ball remained the same. Waving his hand, the ball of dark energy flew off towards the nine star-like fireballs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As small as the ball of darkness was in front of the tremendous fireballs, a strange sight occurred when the two opposing elements clashed against one another!</span></p>

Soon, it overtook the entire fireball into the hole as if absorbing and devouring it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second fireball was coming in to impact against it right after the first. Like the first, the second fireball was absorbed into the black ball. Then the third, and the fourth…one by one, the small black ball was taking in every single fireball on its way towards Bai Yunfei!</span></p>

The Cataclysmic Seal shook all over from the explosion before being sent whirling back towards Bai Yunfei.</span></p>

Though he had managed to nip both attacks in the bud, the fact that there could still be this much power in one of them was beyond what he expected. This attack was minuscule in size, but its power was far too strong for a Mid-stage Soul King to handle.</span></p>

Instead, he had a calculative glare on his face.</span></p>

History has shown several such arrays before, but it seems improbable that Bai Yunfei would know any one of them, let alone use them. We were the ones to bring him here, there shouldn’t have been any time for him to place an array either. So what is going on here…”</span></p>

But even though he managed to dodge the Cataclysmic Seal, a streak of violet light was already whistling towards him!</span></p>

Li Fenghai knew that this was a flying sword that was coming at him. Waving his right hand, a black beam of light flew out from it to come into contact with the incoming Heaven’s Thunder. There was a clanging sound as the two streaks of light rebounded off one another. Within the black of streak had been a longsword of his own.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Fenghai took back the sword into his hand and stared strangely at it for a moment. Then as if realizing something was amiss, he swung his right hand around so that the sword would protect his back! There was a second clanging sound and an explosion of violet light before whatever it was that attacked his back dissipated—a mirror image of the Heaven’s Thunder had been used to attack Li Fenghai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mirror image of the Heaven’s Thunder was followed up by the Fire-tipped Spear.

If he could kill Bai Yunfei, then these things would be his.</span></p>

The backlash will tear heavily into your body, do you really think it wise to be doing these probing attacks?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei gave him a non-committal curl of the lips. “Fine then, we can skip the probing attacks and move on to the real battle…”</span></p>

Then, he raised his right hand up to point at the sky.</span></p>

The part of the skies where he pointed at suddenly started to tremble before fire started to appear near his finger. It exploded in intensity before quickly reaching the levels of an ocean of fire to seemingly try to burn away at the world!</span></p>

It was several hundred times larger than a regular palm and was traveling fast enough to threaten to smash Li Fenghai into the ground if he didn’t act now!</span></p>
