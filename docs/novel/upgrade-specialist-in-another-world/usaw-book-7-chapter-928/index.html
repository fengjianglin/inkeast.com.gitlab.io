 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several members of the Qin were still seated there in the same cave where Qin Tian and the other two members left from. One of the more solemn-faced individuals had been waiting for some time after Qin Tian left before he decided to speak up. “Qin Xia, notify every Soul Exalt within our family to gather on the surface. Spread out around a five-kilometer perimeter over the mine and guard every entrance. Order them to disallow entry to everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” A skinny but middle-aged man bowed at once before quickly leaving the cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aside from the patriarch seated in the middle, this solemn-faced individual was the oldest one there. He was the cousin of Qin Tian and was named Qin He, one of the strongest of the Qin. He was close to being a Peak Late-stage Soul King and also close to becoming a Soul Emperor, but Qin Tian was stronger than him by a small amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it wasn’t long after the one named Qin Xia left that the people in the cave found themselves astir once more to gape at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two auras were rapidly approaching them. One of them was Qin Xia, and the other was a scholarly-looking person behind held up by him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was alarmed at their sudden reappearance. “Qin Shu!” One person exclaimed, “What reason have you for coming back? Did something happen?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one named Qin Shu looked like death had warmed over onto his face. He wasn’t injured by any physical means, but his body seemed like it was without strength. Just standing required Qin Xia to hold him up as he gasped. Terror filled Qin Shu’s face when he was asked the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We were ambushed!! Outside the mines!! Uncle and Qin Jian were…they were both killed!”</span></p>

Horror gripped at them all as what Qin Shu said was processed into their minds. Qin He himself flew forward to grab Qin Shu by the chest to bring him close. “What did you say?!” He barked, “Repeat yourself at once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His authoritative voice towards Qin Shu wasn’t meant to intimidate the man, but to refocus his mind and drive out the terror. Qin Shu trembled as Qin He’s words took affect onto his person. “We…” He began to stutter, “we were just twenty-five kilometers away from Swallow City when someone attacked us from a nearby mountain. Not even uncle could sense them until they attacked. There were two of them. One of them was so skilled at hiding that he blended in with the world itself. When he attacked us, the other appeared behind uncle and…and killed him! Qin Jian tried to attack, but he was killed as well! I…I knew I couldn’t win, so…so I fled back here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>

No one knew what to say or do but just stare at him…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible! Someone that can assassinate the previous head in one move?! That’s ludicrous! I don’t believe it! How could there be such a powerful person!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A white-haired elder cried out in exasperation. Though he cried out his misgivings, his reactions said otherwise.</span></p>

How…how could anyone believe in something like that?!</span></p>

The news was disproportionately terrifying to even think about. No one&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">wanted&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">to believe what Qin Shu was saying, but they had to!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin He was the calmest figure within the cave. Aside from the faint layer of disbelief showing on his face, Qin He had also a pondering expression on his face as he thought about the possibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes snapped back to Qin Shu as if he realized something. “A person skilled in assassinations…and hiding within the world itself? He was able to assassinate Qin Hu and even Qin Tian without a sound…I can only think of one person capable of all that. Jing ‘Death God’ Wuying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?! Jing Wuying!?” Someone else cried out. “The patriarch of the Jing?! Didn’t he die a long time ago?! We investigated him a long time ago. He didn’t even appear when the Jing were exterminated, how could he possibly be alive still?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speaker’s voice was trembling from fear. Jing Wuying was clearly someone so powerfully terrifying that even speaking his name invoked fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s the only one…no one else would have that kind of strength or motive to fight our Qin!” Qin He spat. “It’s definitely Jing Wuying!”</span></p>

What…what should we do? The man was already a Peak Late-stage Soul King when he was last heard of multiple decades ago. All the rumors said he died when trying to become a Soul Emperor. Could…could those rumors be wrong? Could he be a Soul Emperor now?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another horrifying thought that only served to deepen the terror everyone in the cave felt.</span></p>

Why would he spend so much effort assassinating our members if he was a Soul Emperor? He could’ve killed the entire Qin by himself then!” Qin He refuted, “He must’ve failed to become a Soul Emperor and was injured! That’s why he spent all those years in hiding! He must only be a Peak Late-stage Soul King!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…even if he is, what can we do?” Another elder asked. “Even as a Peak Late-stage Soul King he remains an opponent we cannot fight against! He’s skilled in the art of assassination and subterfuge. We don’t stand a chance! If the Death God has his eye on our Qin, what can we possibly do?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes were focused entirely on Qin He now. They were all expecting an answer from him, but it was no use. Not even he had a plan against an enemy as powerful and sudden as this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From all the days before, the Qin had been waiting since forever for their patriarch to become a Soul Emperor. His ascension to the next level would bring forth the elevation of their family!&nbsp;</span></p>

Something had piqued their surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint red light was shining from the patriarch’s person and his eyes were slowly starting to open…&nbsp;</span></p>

With each time the beams of light landed on a person, the person would shiver momentarily as if feeling their very soul being scrutinized, their bodies bent set on fire, and their blood being boiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Patriarch, have…have you…” Qin He started to speak hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The patriarch’s eyes swiveled to look at Qin He.
