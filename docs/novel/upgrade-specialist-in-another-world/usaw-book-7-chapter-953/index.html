All the Soul Kings from the Qin were more-or-less dead, but…there was still patriarch Qin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who was beyond the realm of a Soul King. The terrifying Half-emperor!</span></p>

It was like some kind of giant beast made completely from fire was trying to burn everything around it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soulforce within the area was stifling enough, but the spread of the flames was so quick that it had already traveled five kilometers within moments!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The very edge of the flames was just shy of a few thousand steps away from Bai Yunfei now. A giant arm made completely from the fire formed from it to reach out and smash Bai Yunfei to pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the face of the giant hand—or even just a single finger—Bai Yunfei was basically the size of a small fly. It felt like any second now, he’d be crushed to death just like a fly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s mind was paralyzed with fear. He was nearly close to crying out in his fear as well, but then his senses caught back up to him. The Cataclysmic Seal immediately flew up above his head to protect him while he prepared a few hand seals…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!!”</span></p>

The world tremored as the two lights smashed against each other. Like the wind, the black light swirled around the giant fiery arm to engulf it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom…rumble!!”</span></p>

The space in the middle where the two elements collided were warping inwards on itself as if space itself was threatening to destabilize!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Retreat!!!”</span></p>

His hand called the Cataclysmic Seal to get in between him and the space in front of him as he called for Xiao Qi, Jing Mingfeng, and Xiao Nan to get as far away from the place as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the outside, everyone could only see a tornado of black and red light ‘coil’ around each other as if fighting each other for dominance.</span></p>

He didn’t actually want to find out though and resolved to get as far away from this place as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A furious red-eyed patriarch Qin stood in the middle of the fiery tornado. He was as skinny as a corpse and deranged looking with how his arms were unceasingly shooting flames to coil around the figure in black in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure in black was Jing Wuying. He had a halo of black light circling around him, cloaking him like he was a reaper traveling through the night. It almost seemed as if he was one with the darkness with how easily he blended in with the darkness. Not even his aura could be substantially felt when scanned with soulsense. It was only because of the fire and its direct contrast to his black figure that made his figure noticeable in the day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his right hand was an especially black-colored dagger. Its edge was slightly crooked with one side of it having a rather spooky-looking barb. But the most peculiar part of the dagger was the hilt of the dagger where several smaller blades could be seen connected to it by strands of black-silk that seemed to almost float in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying had an especially serious look on his face in direct contrast to the deranged one on patriarch Qin’s face. The only thing he was doing was defending against the elemental fire coming at him. Retaliation wasn’t even something he was bothering to consider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Patriarch Qin really did look like he was about to go crazy. Never could he possibly imagine that so many unexpected developments could happen today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only needed a few weeks to be in the most optimal state to try to breakthrough. But Jing Wuying chose now of all times to attack, and the Qin had no choice but to risk outing themselves to the world in order to sacrifice everyone they could get their hands on to hasten his breakthrough process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The method he was using to try and become a Soul Emperor was the Soul Fusing Array. Its original purpose was to gather the soul energy of all the departed spirits underneath the earth to turn into processed energy that a soul cultivator could use to improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ‘soul’ was something that the majority of the world deemed as something ‘intangible’. Even the more specialized soul cultivators who studied the soul only knew to improve their soul as much as they could. But none of them could probably give a reason why this was effective other than saying ‘it works’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a soul cultivator or soulbeast died, their souls would dissipate. That was something that was true for all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the death of a person also actually meant leaving behind an aspect of the soul in the world. The energy left behind was known to most as ‘decaying aura’ and would gradually disappear with time. Decaying aura could be guided and pulled given the proper abundance of elemental energy and dissipate in said places. Generally said, these areas of high elemental energy were deep within the earth, so the energy of the departed would gather there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And so the Soul Fusing Array was something that even ordinary soul cultivators could use to make use of the soul left behind from the decaying aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the mines was an ideal spot to place the Soul Fusing Array in. The patriarch had already been locked away in training to take in the remnant energy of the decaying aura even before he knew about the Soul Fusing Array with how ideal it was for his training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In time though, the amount of energy grew less and less and the patriarch started to worry about his training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was when the Qin came across something that could help the patriarch. The Soul Fusing Array which could take in the souls of the departed; a new source of energy the patriarch could partake in! This was a huge benefit for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was also when rumors of people going missing due to a mysterious beast started to make its rounds in the mines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they said that the Soul Fusing Array was meant to take the souls of those who died to empower the user, then the wanton killing of soul cultivators would definitely give rise to a lot of opposition. The world would never allow such a perverse thing to exist, and the Qin would definitely be fought against by a coalition of people for the sake of safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he resolved to have all the miners brought to him and sacrificed, patriarch Qin figured that it’d be fine as long as he became a Soul Emperor. Should he be successful, he could probably say that those who died had died because of their close proximity when he broke through. The dead told no tales, and no one would be any wiser to the actual truth but the Qin themselves. Even if someone&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">did</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;think this was suspicious, the patriarch could have the person killed and the news suppressed before it could become something major.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t half-bad of a plan, but too bad for him things weren’t going as he expected!</span></p>

He was relying on the array for the one chance to absorb enough energy to breakthrough. The fact that Jing Wuying was coming in to steal that energy was the same thing as forever ruining his chances to breakthrough!</span></p>
