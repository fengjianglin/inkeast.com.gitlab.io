 <p>Chapter 375: The Hillbeast</p>
 <p>The real body of the hillbeast hides within its core, making the outer layer of its body the ‘armor’. After years over years of existence with elemental earth converging at its core, the outermost layers became as hard as regular stone while the inner layers grow progressively harder. When a hillbeasts wants to move, it’d use its elemental earth to make countless of stone formations to act as its legs.</p>
 <p>The more Bai Yunfei looked at the hillbeast, the more information about it came to mind. Hillbeasts were very slow to begin with, so Bai Yunfei had plenty of time to think.</p>
 <p><em>“If its real body is at its center…..then I’ll try using my own strength to stop it! If I can’t, then I’ll have the Cataclysmic Seal break it apart….”</em> Bai Yunfei began to plan out his course of action.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t too worried about being able to stop this soulbeast or not. Having the perverse Cataclysmic Seal was a guarantee to stopping the hillbeast already. But the biggest load Bai Yunfei had was that he knew the hillbeast was the final soulbeast to fight.</p>
 <p>With those two facts, Bai Yunfei decided that now was the time to test his own strength and see just how far he could take himself with the +13 effect of the Cataclysmic Seal.</p>
 <p>Concentrating his strength to his feet, Bai Yunfei leapt up ten meters into the air. A flash of red light converged underneath his feet, and with a tap, Bai Yunfei leapt up yet again.</p>
 <p>Skywalking!</p>
 <p>A feat only Soul Exalts were capable of. By converging elemental energy to the feet for just one moment, they could materialize a foothold to step on. When Bai Yunfei was in his ‘coil’ form, Skywalking became possible.</p>
 <p>One hop after another, Bai Yunfei ascended into the skies towards the slow-moving hillbeast. After about a kilometer of traveling in this fashion, Bai Yunfei came to a stop just two hundred meters away from the hillbeast. Still a hundred meters up in the air, Bai Yunfei observed the hillbeast, only to think that he felt like an insignificant speck of sand next to it.</p>
 <p>He quirked his lips. For a moment, he didn’t know how exactly to start this fight off.</p>
 <p>“Let’s try this then….”</p>
 <p>His right hand went up. Palm facing upwards, the Ardent Sun Glove lit up brilliantly with light as elemental fire started to converge and spin on top of his palm. With a ‘bang’, it turned into a fireball five meters in radius above his head.</p>
 <p>“Here we go!!”</p>
 <p>Like a conducting baton, his right hand twirled and pointed at the giant mountain, commanding the fireball to fly straight for the incoming hillbeast!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!!”</p>
 <p>Stone and dirt flew up into the air following an ear-deafening explosion. Persisting for several seconds before clearing away, the dust soon showed a thirty meter deep crater on the hillbeast’s body, but…..the hillbeast hadn’t stopped at all!!</p>
 <p>In fact, it didn’t even seem like it had even noticed it was attacked!</p>
 <p>“Tsk! So even that wasn’t enough?” Bai Yunfei clicked his tongue. Returning the Fire-tipped Spear to his right hand, Bai Yunfei started his descent down to that crater, and with arms that bulged furiously, he stabbed down at its center with the spear!</p>
 <p>For the sake of guaranteeing that the explosion effect would activate, Bai Yunfei used the Ninefold Stab, thus increasing its power and burying the spear halfway into the hillbeast!</p>
 <p>“Boom!” Another explosion.</p>
 <p>This time, the crater had been opened another ten meters!</p>
 <p>“Still not enough?!” Twisting his hand, the Fire-tipped Spear disappeared back into his ring. Instead of using the spear, he brought up both hands to punch!</p>
 <p>Eighty-one Fold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!” With the third explosion, the crater grew bigger yet again!!</p>
 <p>A strong amount of recoil came springing back at him, causing Bai Yunfei to fall back in surprise; the recoil had brought him back twenty meters!</p>
 <p>Having stabilized himself with elemental fire gripping his feet to the ground, Bai Yunfei was just about to continue his assault when he felt something was coming.</p>
 <p>Hastily bringing up the Cataclysmic Seal, Bai Yunfei protected himself with the barrier provided to him.</p>
 <p>Just as he did so, an abnormally strong amount of elemental earth was starting to form from the crater he made. The sounds of crumbling could be heard before countless stalagmites shot forth from the ground to stab at Bai Yunfei like arrows!!</p>
 <p>No sooner was the barrier up completely did the stalagmites rain down onto its entire surface!</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang….”</p>
 <p>Like hail onto a hard surface, Bai Yunfei’s entire person was obscured by the amount of stalagmites coming down on his person. Whenever one barrage of stalagmites was jettisoned out from the ground, another volley was already being prepared to be fire at Bai Yunfei in one continuous motion. In no time, hundreds….and even thousands of stalagmites had been fired!</p>
 <p>These stalagmites were being controlled as well. If Bai Yunfei went to the side, they’d turn and chase after him!</p>
 <p>Each one that struck his barrier hadn’t even time to fall before the next one was already coming up behind it. In practically seconds, the entire barrier was turned into a giant stone ball with how many stalagmites were stabbed into it, trapping Bai Yunfei in its center!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!” From within the sphere, a furious explosion of red light pierced through the cracks before Bai Yunfei’s Fire-tipped Spear came stabbing out from it. In an instant, Bai Yunfei broke free from his confines and flew a thousand meters backwards to land safely in the air.</p>
 <p>“That was close<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>never thought that the hillbeast would attack back so seriously. I nearly ate it back there….” Bai Yunfei muttered from behind the safety of his barrier, goosebumps covering both his arms.</p>
 <p>But when Bai Yunfei looked back to the hillbeast, his eyes flew wide open in shock<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>on the ‘body’ of the hillbeast, the three craters Bai Yunfei had inflicted onto it was….was gone!!</p>
 <p>It looked as though they hadn’t existed to begin with, and the hillbeast had always that same pristine mountain shape!</p>
 <p>“Hoouuuu….”</p>
 <p>A muffled but deep roar erupted through the air, startling Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>This roar came from the hillbeast!</p>
 <p>“Is it angry?” Bai Yunfei smirked, “So that means my attack <em>did</em> do something….</p>
 <p>“But you’re still not stopping!!” Bai Yunfei sighed. The hillbeast in front of him was finally starting to speed up, “Then I’ll just have to break you to pieces!”</p>
 <p>With an eye to the Cataclysmic Seal, Bai Yunfei looked back to the hillbeast. A brilliant glint appeared in his eyes. “I highly doubt that my +13 effect won’t do anything to you! I’ve still ten minutes left to my ‘coil’ form….and then some!”</p>
 <p>Seemingly determined to test out his one ultimate move by the end of today and having the ‘coil’ form still, Bai Yunfei was without fear for anything else.</p>
 <p>Brandishing his right hand to summon his Tempest Sword, Bai Yunfei flew up into the skies rather than by Skywalking.</p>
 <p>His speed on the Tempest Sword allowed Bai Yunfei to reach the area a hundred meters above the hillbeast in record time. Upon seeing the orange light from the hillbeast start to glow again, Bai Yunfei narrowed his eyes and started to go through several complex hand seals.</p>
 <p>Hand seal after hand seal, Bai Yunfei’s hands was like a blur in between movement. A terribly strong amount of aura was starting to exude forth from his body, and then when his hands landed upon the very last hand seal, the soulforce in his body had immediately turned into….elemental fire!</p>
