 <p>Chapter 500: Fighting Yao Tong Again (Third)</p>
 <p>The moment Bai Yunfei sensed someone was approaching, he sucked in a sharp breath, <em>“Someone else from the Xing?!”</em></p>
 <p>But then when he saw the person coming over, his eyes widened in shock, “It’s him!” He thought.</p>
 <p>He had seen this person before!</p>
 <p>It was six years ago, but Bai Yunfei came across this man with a strange golden mask before!</p>
 <p>Back in Stonegroove City where he met Jing Mingfeng, this man had chased after him!</p>
 <p>At that time, Bai Yunfei had nearly lost his life in the stone forest outside the city. It was only with Jiang Fan’s timely assistance that he was able to escape. (Refer to Chapter 103 for more details)</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei never imagined that he’d meet the same man again six years later.</p>
 <p>But while he was thinking to himself about the surprise, the man was already descending down to the ground a few hundred meters away.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Yao Tong stared at Bai Yunfei, his eyes flashing with light from behind his mask. There was also a curious look when he took in the sights of the two soulbeasts with him.</p>
 <p>Of course, he didn’t recognize Bai Yunfei. Too much time had already passed for that. The opposite wasn’t true for Bai Yunfei since Yao Tong had left a deep impression on him.</p>
 <p>But what Yao Tong was doing was observing Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stood up to stare back. He didn’t know what the man was after, but he clearly wasn’t here on good business, as he was already in a fighting stance.</p>
 <p>“Hand over Xing Qiuhong’s space ring and your life will be spared.”</p>
 <p>The man spoke after a long period of silence.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei lifted an eyebrow<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>how ‘arrogant’ this man was!</p>
 <p>This man was a late-stage Soul Exalt, meaning he felt himself confident in his odds against a mid-stage Soul Exalt. There was also the other two soulbeast with Bai Yunfei to consider. Xiao Qi was a mid-stage class six, and Xiao Lan was a late-stage class six. So Bai Yunfei found it very strange that the man was so confident in his chances.</p>
 <p><em>“He...must have a strong soulbeast with him that makes him think he can win….”</em> Bai Yunfei guessed.</p>
 <p>And as if proving Bai Yunfei’s guess, a gold streak of light flew up into the air behind Yao Tong like a shining meteor to land upon his right shoulder.</p>
 <p>It was a gold colored swift!</p>
 <p><em>“What a rare soulbeast<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>a golden swift! And a….peak late-stage class six one!”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyes widened as he identified the soulbeast. This surely had to be the soulbeast Yao Tong was contracted with, it was stronger than Yao Tong himself!</p>
 <p>The golden swift was a soulbeast even rarer than the blue-eyes wyrm and thunderfire wolf. It had only one element, but its speed wouldn't lose out to even those training in the wind element. It couldn’t change its size either, but with its small body and great speed, it could fly straight and true another person’s body like an arrow.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s mood grew slightly grim at the appearance of the golden swift. He didn’t know if his senses were dulled due to the previous battle, but Bai Yunfei had the distinct feeling that this person would be a lot harder to beat than Xing Qiuhong….</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei didn’t grace him with a response for ten seconds, Yao Tong’s eyes hardened. His right hand extended outwards, a golden sword appearing in his hand.</p>
 <p>“I’ll just have to kill you and take the ring from you then.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had been trying to think of why this man would want Xing Qiuhong’s space ring so much, but time had not permitted him to think any longer. He couldn’t look at what was so special about the ring either since he had to deal with this guy before he could do it.</p>
 <p>Since his opponent was now ready to fight, Bai Yunfei saw no reason to not prepare either. His Fire-tipped Spear and Cataclysmic Seal appeared in his hand and above him in a flash of light.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan prepared to fight as well.</p>
 <p>The golden swift on Yao Tong’s shoulder chose then to let out a screech before flying forward!</p>
 <p>Quickly too!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was completely caught off guard by its speed! It beat his Flash Step by a good margin in speed!</p>
 <p>He had been prepared for movement, but the speed at which the bird was flying at was nearly too fast for Bai Yunfei to see completely as it shot at him!</p>
 <p>It was almost easier to say the golden swift had transformed into a golden bullet to shoot Bai Yunfei through the heart!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was confident that even with his armor, the golden swift would be strong enough to break through it and him!</p>
 <p>It was a good thing he had the Cataclysmic Seal!</p>
 <p>As fast as the golden swift could fly, a single thought travels even faster. Before the bird could get to Bai Yunfei, the Cataclysmic Seal had already erected a barrier to protect Bai Yunfei as he moved to the left.</p>
 <p>“Crash!!”</p>
 <p>Like the shattering of glass, Bai Yunfei was astounded to see his earth barrier stop the golden swift for just a brief moment before shattering into pieces!</p>
 <p>He hadn’t put in the maximum amount of soulforce, sure, but that didn’t take away from how terrifyingly strong the swift was!</p>
 <p>Not even decreasing in speed, the golden swift blew past Bai Yunfei’s waist and cut at his soul armor, leaving behind a gash in it!</p>
 <p>The golden swift’s first attempt had failed to kill Bai Yunfei, and now the favor was being returned with a giant tail to hit it!</p>
 <p>The blue-eyes wyrm had calculated the golden swift’s flight path and swung its tail accordingly. When it seemed like it would connect, the golden swift amazingly swerved out of the way and evaded the wyrm’s tail!</p>
 <p>There was an angry trill as Xiao Qi launched itself at the swift, its wings glowing azure and violet to chase it down!</p>
 <p>A pre-emptive strike like the one done by the golden swift had signaled the start of the battle brilliantly. Bai Yunfei had only just a moment to himself after the blow when he saw a gleam of golden light in front of him<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>Yao Tong was already in front of him with his golden longsword ready to stab Bai Yunfei through the throat!</p>
 <p>Yao Tong’s speed was just as fast as Bai Yunfei’s Flash Step!</p>
 <p>Narrowing his eyes, Bai Yunfei brought his Fire-tipped Spear up to defend against the sword. Clashing with each other, Bai Yunfei kicked against the ground to bring him several meters away from Yao Tong.</p>
 <p>As Yao Tong was about to chase after him, he suddenly leapt to his right, abandoning the chase just in time for the blue-eyes wyrm’s tail to sail through the area where his head had once been!</p>
 <p>Given this reprieve, Bai Yunfei extended his hand towards the Cataclysmic Seal. The fireseed in it popped out, and then into his chest.</p>
 <p>Fighting this man as a mid-stage Soul Exalt would be pointless, he had to enter the ‘coil’ form!</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s sharp increase in strength elicited a small gasp from Yao Tong, but he didn’t falter in his movements. In another burst of speed, he flew at Bai Yunfei again with his sword ready to pierce Bai Yunfei’s forehead this time!</p>
