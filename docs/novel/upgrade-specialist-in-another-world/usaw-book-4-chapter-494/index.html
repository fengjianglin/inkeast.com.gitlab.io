 <p>Chapter 494: Yue Feng's Goal</p>
 <p>“Clack….”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stepped onto a nearby boulder with a clack.</p>
 <p>Right by his side was the blue-eyes wyrm, already back to its miniature form, and Xiao Qi roosting on his right shoulder. Underneath Bai Yunfei was the peak of one of the two mountains.</p>
 <p>He looked down over the mountain, looking over the the valley where a battle had just taken place. Aside from the fifty craters that adorned the riverbanks, nothing else about the valley seemed off.</p>
 <p>Many of these craters were filled with water from the river, so the results of the battle didn’t look too devastating to the environment.</p>
 <p>But that didn’t take away from the facts: eight bodies were currently lying down on the ground.</p>
 <p>The search and pursuit team that had gone after Bai Yunfei to kill him were on the inverse killed <em>by</em> him.</p>
 <p>Two of their contracted soulbeasts were killed, and the others had fled. Bai Yunfei didn’t bother chasing after them. A soulbeast without its contracted soul cultivator, where else could it go but return to the Soulbeast Forest?</p>
 <p>The entirety of the battle that took the lives of these ten beings took only a short five minutes….</p>
 <p>Xing Qiufeng was the only one Bai Yunfei killed. The others were claimed by Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm.</p>
 <p>“These have to be at least half the fighting force of the Xing, right? I heard their house head was only a peak-stage Soul Exalt, but he’s not here….Xing Luo said before that an ancestor of theirs was a Soul King, wonder if that’s true.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t really fear if the peak late-stage Soul Exalt, Xing Qiuhong would give chase, but if the so-called Soul King were to appear and give chase, there would definitely be a great ordeal for Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Ugh,” Bai Yunfei sighed. “Better not take chances and fly away. Beats sticking around and fighting the rest of the Xing.”</p>
 <p>Truth be told, Bai Yunfei worried the ancestor. The Xing shouldn’t have caught up to him so fast, but they did. Walking on foot would be a silly idea now with that in mind.</p>
 <p>“But first things first…” The Tempest Sword appeared besides him.</p>
 <p>“You’ve been following me since you left Ventia City, what are your intentions? Continue with your stalking and I won’t be as polite as I was before!”</p>
 <p>His voice was directed towards a portion of the river below.</p>
 <p>There was someone….there?!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei continued to stare at the area a little longer, as if waiting for something. On the other hand, Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm stared curiously at Bai Yunfei, unsure why he was speaking to nothing but air.</p>
 <p>“Haha!! So you saw me? You’re good, I’ll tell you that….and here I thought I was completely hidden!”</p>
 <p>A good several seconds later, the embarrassed chuckles of a person responded to Bai Yunfei. From the foot of the mountain, a person leapt up to the canopus of a nearby tree.</p>
 <p>This person was the very same man that had been speaking to Yu Li and Nangong Yuexia earlier, Yue Feng!</p>
 <p>He kicked off from the tree, leaping from footrest to footrest to ascend up the mountain and to a respectful distance away from Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei said and did nothing but stare. This man didn’t seem to harbor any ill-will towards him, but he was still unsure what exactly his intentions were.</p>
 <p>Yue Feng came to a stop. He smiled towards Bai Yunfei, “Haha, I am no enemy, my friend, and neither am I with the Xing. I don’t wish to cause any trouble.”</p>
 <p>The brows on Bai Yunfei’s face furrowed together. This man in front of him was only a late-stage Soul Exalt<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>not a level that could intimidate him<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>but Bai Yunfei had the feeling he was a lot stronger and would be harder to deal with than Xing Qiufeng. There was also a rather silly-looking little brown bear slung around his back, and Bai Yunfei could see it was a late-stage class six!</p>
 <p>“Why are you following me?” Bai Yunfei asked.</p>
 <p>“I won’t lie,” Yue Feng smiled, “I’m following you because I’m waiting for somebody.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“What I’m after has to do with the Xing. Since the Xing are chasing you, then the person I’m after will be with them. So if I follow you, I’ll meet him.”</p>
 <p>“Do you have a grudge with the Xing?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, no, that’s not it.” Yue Feng dismissed Bai Yunfei’s question, but he spoke again with a cold gleam in his eyes. “The person I’ve a grudge with is currently a guest of the Xing. He’s hiding there, and even I don’t have the strength to go after him as he hides. That is, until you came today….hehe, I hope you don’t mind, my friend, that I will take on that man when the Xing comes again. I’m sure you’ll find it helpful to you.”</p>
 <p>So that was it, Bai Yunfei realized. This man wanted to use Bai Yunfei as bait for someone, but that in itself wasn’t too much of a bad thing since this man had nothing to do with him.</p>
 <p>And Bai Yunfei had nothing to do with his grudges.</p>
 <p>Not caring for the story, Bai Yunfei waved his Tempest Sword to him. Stepping onto it, he prepared to fly away.</p>
 <p>Yue Feng spoke up in a hurry, “Woah, hold on! Brother, you can’t leave! If you go, then the person I’m after might no come!”</p>
 <p>He really didn’t want Bai Yunfei to leave for a reason, of course. Should the person he was after come, he wouldn’t be coming alone. The head of the Xing would most definitely be with him, and Bai Yunfei would be the one to fight him, leaving Yue Feng open to fight the other. But if Bai Yunfei left, then that’d mean Yue Feng would have to fight the two of them without any help.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t concern me.” Was the response. Bai Yunfei was already on the sword, and the blue-eyes wyrm leaping on it with him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t fly then! If you walk, they’ll be here in a fl—” As he was pleading with a finger pointing to Ventia City, a spike in soulforce alerted him to something.</p>
 <p>“Haha, they’re here!”</p>
 <p>His look of joy was not reflected by Bai Yunfei. Looking towards the city, Bai Yunfei saw two bolts of gold and purple light fly on over towards them.</p>
 <p>The second volley was here, and quick too!</p>
 <p>And these two men were both….peak late-stage Soul Exalts!</p>
 <p>One of them men was surely the head of the Xing, but who was the other?</p>
 <p>“The metal-type soul cultivator on the left is the head of the Xing, Xing Qiuhong. The lightning-type soul cultivator on the right is the strongest guest of the Xing, a wanderer infamous in the the Northern Ridge Province. Zi Mei the Wanderer’. The person I’m after is him….”</p>
 <p>Yue Feng spoke to Bai Yunfei with a frown. The sight of Zi Mei had brought out a murderous intent from the man ever since he appeared.</p>
 <p>“There are two people there, and two of us. We’ll take one a piece, no problems with that?”</p>
