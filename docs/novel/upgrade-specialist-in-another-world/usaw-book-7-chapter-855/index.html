 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

His entire body was aglow with red light along with the Cataclysmic Seal to his left and the Fire-tipped Spear to his right floating in the air. He looked asleep almost with how he was breathing. Gradually, his eyes opened back up to reveal strong light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt pleased with how much strength was coming out from his body. But at the same time, there was also a sliver of regret…&nbsp;</span></p>

Bai Yunfei was a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt, so becoming an Early-stage Soul King was a non-issue. Becoming a Mid-stage Soul King though was just a step away. It was a conclusion that was already ridiculous to begin with since it had only been a month since he started using Realm Accretion. According to his and Xiao Fang’s calculations, it would’ve required one or two years for him to become a Mid-stage Soul King and seven to eight years to become a Late-stage Soul King. The fact that he improved this much within the course of a month was already something to rejoice over…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still. The fact that he was so close to becoming a Mid-stage Soul King couldn’t be understated, and Bai Yunfei couldn’t help but feel pity over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t have any time to reflect on that though. In the time he spent thinking about this, three powerful attacks were homing in on him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes frosted over with anger. As if already prepared for something like this, Bai Yunfei waved a hand almost lazily to seemingly manipulate something in the air around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ripple of something formulated in response to his actions, but then at the moment after, Bai Yunfei’s entire body was engulfed by a blinding explosion of light!</span></p>

The surrounding air was practically frozen over when its jaws snapped shut. It still remained to be seen if it had snapped onto Bai Yunfei since the dragon had fully obscured the area around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nine snakes were next to strike. As if looking forward to devouring its prey, the nine of them coiled around the area where Bai Yunfei was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Last was the gigantic golden mountain. Descending down from the skies, the mountain looked like it was descending down from the heavens to smash all that was beneath it.</span></p>

The ultimate moves of three different Soul Kings being used on the very same space? There was hardly even a half-second of silence before several explosions ransacked the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom!! Boom!!”</span></p>

After the three attacks landed on top of Bai Yunfei, all that was left to see was a gigantic mountain. It caused the entire land and the surrounding leagues to quake immensely when it impacted before crumbling apart to turn into sand to cover anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he dead? He has to be. Even a Late-stage Soul King wouldn’t be able to take on those three moves, that Bai Yunfei probably doesn’t have any bones left!!”</span></p>

Rather than being happy or confused, the elder was stark-white as if he had seen a ghost!!</span></p>

Early-stage Soul Kings were generally not capable of teleportation at first either. It still required time and dedication to understand how space worked. Normally, it’d take most people when they became a Mid-stage Soul King to become able of teleportation unless they were sufficiently talented. For example, both Long Lan and Xiao Qi were incapable of teleporting given their current level of strength. No one—barring the space-type soul cultivators—should be capable of teleportation when they became a Soul King. Geniuses included.</span></p>

By using the Core Stone, he was able to teleport a sufficient distance away to safety without having even his robes singed by the attacks.</span></p>

Forcing down his shock, he shouted in anger and charged forwards to continue attacking.</span></p>

The difference here was that it was a Mid-stage Soul King creating all this ice and that it had a greater area of coverage than the former. The elemental ice had also a special property that disallowed teleportation within its range.</span></p>

And this time, the three men were sure to hone in on Bai Yunfei’s soulsense for better accuracy. The three of them were thoroughly convinced their plan would work this time with all their preparations!</span></p>
