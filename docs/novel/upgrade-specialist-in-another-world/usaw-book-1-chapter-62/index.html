 <p>Chapter 62: The +10 Additional Effects of Accessories</p>
 <p>In the morning of the next day,</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was sitting with legs crossed on the bed looking at an orange bracelet in his hand with a slight frown.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>The information in his mind disappointed him for a while again. He reached his hand out to one side and tilted his palm. An amount of dust fell down and piled up on a piece of white cloth beside him. That basin-sized piece of white cloth had already been sprinkled with various powders of different colors. These powders were what was left of the pieces of jewelry that had been destroyed by failed upgrades in just the last two hours.</p>
 <p>Because today Bai Yunfei had to wait for Qiu Luliu to come looking for him, he did not go anywhere. According to his original plan, he should leave today, but now he had no choice but to stay for another day. Because he did not know when Qiu Luliu would arrive, he had decided to make use of this period of time to continue his research into jewelry upgrades.</p>
 <p><em>“It was the fifth one. I still haven’t even got a +9 item. Somehow I feel that upgrading jewelry must be harder than upgrading weapons and defensive items?”</em> Bai Yunfei shook his head in frustration. After being depressed inwardly for a while, he took out a milky white pearl necklace.</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade.”</em></p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade&nbsp;Successful</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: High </strong><br><strong>Upgrade Level: +9 </strong><br><strong>Additional Attribute: +23 Agility</strong>&nbsp;<br><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 17 Soulpoints</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had a happy expression, “I’ve finally succeeded!”</p>
 <p>Putting this +9 necklace down to one side, he took out another bracelet and continued to upgrade it. Unfortunately, he failed again and it was destroyed.</p>
 <p>Either because it really was more difficult to upgrade jewelry or because Bai Yunfei was unlucky, out of the twelve pieces of jewelry he upgraded afterwards, he was only able to obtain two +9 items, a bracelet and a ring.</p>
 <p>“Alas...” Bai Yunfei let out a sigh of frustration again and looked outside the window. It was already morning, “Qiu Luliu said that she’d arrive before afternoon. She should be here soon. Will I just call it a day like this? But... I don’t want to give up! Let’s just upgrade these three items to see what will happen! If I successfully upgrade one of them, I’ll know the additional effect of a +10 piece of jewelry!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Yunfei thought about this, he no longer cared about the fact that it had taken him several hours of hard work to obtain these items. As he picked up that necklace, his eyes showed an expression of expectation.</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade Failed</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Destroyed</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>“Alas! I was indeed too naive to think so!" With a whimper in his mind, Bai Yunfei scattered the powder in his hand sadly and picked up that +9 ring.</p>
 <p>“Now that I already started, I can’t give up halfway through no matter what!</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade&nbsp;Successful</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>At first, subconsciously Bai Yunfei was prepared to sigh, but now he was suddenly dumbstruck for a moment then had an ecstatic expression: “I unexpectedly, unexpectedly succeeded!”</p>
 <p>In an excited state of mind, Bai Yunfei looked at the ring in his hand impatiently and gave it a thought.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: High </strong><br><strong>Upgrade Level: +10 </strong><br><strong>Additional Attribute: +32 Endurance </strong><br><strong>+10 Additional Effect: Increase attack speed by 2%</strong>&nbsp;<br><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 21&nbsp;Soulpoints</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Bai Yunfei frowned slightly,<em>&nbsp;“An addition of 32 endurance would mean wearing this ring alone would increase an ordinary person’s endurance by 30%... But it means almost nothing to soul cultivators. Attack speed? Is this an additional ‘stat’? This is the first time I’ve seen something like this. Let’s give it a try...”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei sat straigt up, gently took a breath, clenched his right fist and punched into the air, creating an area of afterimages in front of him. At the same time, his eyes showed a thoughtful expression, looking like he was experiencing something silently.</p>
 <p>After several breaths, he stopped his movements and put that ring on his left hand’s index finger.</p>
 <p>The moment he wore the ring, he felt a wonderful feeling. Although it was extremely faint, he could still feel it clearly. His endurance had become even more bountiful<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>this was the ‘Endurance +32’ effect.</p>
 <p>After taking a deep breath, he raised his arm and began to punch into the air as before. A short while later, he stopped his movements and pondered with his head lowered.</p>
 <p><em>“A 2% increase to attack speed is very good! Though this increase is very small in degree, but unlike those effects with chances of being triggered, I only need to wear this ring for it to be effective! This way, my power has also improved a bit!</em></p>
 <p><em>“It’s a pity I can’t put two rings on one hand at the same time...”</em> Bai Yunfei thought with some regret while looking at his own hands.</p>
 <p>Regarding jewelry, only the first item was effective when worn, which also meant only one ring and one bracelet could be put on an arm. This was also true for earrings and necklaces, that is, an additional earring or necklace would be completely ineffective when worn.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei picked up the last item, that +9 light blue bracelet, with a hesitant expression on his face, <em>“Then... Should I continue to upgrade this one?”</em></p>
 <p>“Yunfei, are you there?”</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei was hesitating, the voice of a girl suddenly rang out outside the door.</p>
 <p>“Miss Qiu has arrived? Oh, no, this is... Meng’er’s voice!” Startled, Bai Yunfei hurriedly got off the bed, properly put on his shoes and walked towards the door of the room.</p>
 <p>After he opened the door, he saw a young girl in blue clothes standing smilingly at the door. She was none other than Liu Meng. Beside her, the servant girl Xiao Ning was looking around somewhat curiously.</p>
 <p>“Meng’er? Why have you come here?” Bai Yunfei was amazed in his mind. Temporarily he even forgot to tell them to enter the room.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? I can’t come to look for you?” Liu Meng asked with the same smiling expression.</p>
 <p>“Er, no, of course you can...”</p>
 <p>“Young master Yunfei, you should invite my young lady into the room. Could it be you want to have a talk while standing at this door? Or could it be there’s another girl hiding in your room so you don’t dare to let my young lady come in?” The little servant girl Xiao Ning always had a sharp tongue. With just a few words, she made Bai Yunfei feel extremely embarrassed again. He hurriedly let the two of them go into the room.</p>
 <p>“Meng’er, didn’t I tell you yesterday that I’ll have something to do today so I can’t be with you? Why have you...” Bai Yunfei said doubtfully while looking at Liu Meng, who was sizing up the room with a bit of curiosity.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, Yunfei? You’re not happy with me coming to look for you?” Liu Meng asked softly, her tone seeming to carry a trace of disappointment.</p>
 <p>“No, of course that’s not true. I just... I’ll probably have to go out in a while, so...” Bai Yunfei hurriedly explained. As soon as he heard Liu Meng’s tone, there was an indescribable trace of nervousness in his heart.</p>
 <p>Seeing Bai Yunfei’s totally anxious expression, Liu Meng smiled again, saying, “Oh, that’s fine. I’ll just stay for a while then leave. Is this okay?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that... That’s fine...” Bai Yunfei hesitated in his mind for a moment. It seemed he subconsciously did not want to let Qiu Luliu and her meet each other.</p>
 <p>“Oh? This bracelet is so beautiful!” Liu Meng’s surprised voice rang out. Bai Yunfei lifted his head to take a look and his heart immediately tightened. It turned out before hurriedly going to open the door, he had casually put that +9 bracelet on the table. Now it had been found by Liu Meng and she was holding it in her hand observing it carefully.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, it’s so beautiful! Light blue, just happens to match young lady’s clothes.” On one side, Xiao Ning was also looking eagerly at this bracelet. Suddenly her eyes rolled and she turned to Bai Yunfei, saying laughingly, “He he, Mister Yunfei, could it be... this is the present you bought to give my young lady? Yesterday, after my young lady gave you that straw hat, you promised to give her a gift in return. Who would have thought you would get it ready so fast?”</p>
 <p>When Liu Meng heard her words, her eyes flashed with a tinge of surprise, her face slightly reddening. She lifted her eyes looking at Bai Yunfei. In her eyes, there seemed to be... a trace of hope?</p>
 <p>“This...” Bai Yunfei felt somewhat awkward, not knowing what he should do.</p>
