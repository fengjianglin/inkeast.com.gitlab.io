 <p>Chapter 102: Kill Them Straight Away</p>
 <p>“He has an accomplice! Be on the lookout for more, don’t let any of them get away!”</p>
 <p>Leading the chasing group were a low-grade and mid-stage&nbsp;Soul Sprite. Behind them were several Soul Warriors and Soul Personages that totaled up to around twenty people. Their auras could cover the entire sky and alert even Bai Yunfei in front of them.</p>
 <p>This was not indignation, but murderous intent!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei swiped at Jing Mingfeng who was passing by his side. With a snarl, he shouted, “Bastard! What did you do!?”</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng’s speed slightly slowed from this motion. Even Bai Yunfei’s speed faltered a bit, but Jing Mingfeng shook off the hand that was at his collar with some force. He tried to explain himself as if he was innocent of his crimes, “I don’t know either, okay? I had only wanted to hang around a mansion to see here and there, but I didn’t think that house would have so many experts in it! As soon as they saw me, they began to chase me down, I’d have been beaten to death if I stayed there! In fact, I nearly found myself dying a couple of times!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Jing Mingfeng suddenly grimaced in pain and clutched at his left shoulder with his right hand. It was then that Bai Yunfei realized that Jing Mingfeng’s left shoulder had been lanced through with a weapon, leaving behind a serious looking wound. Despite the blood being stanched, half of his clothes had already been stained through and through from the blood that he had shed earlier.</p>
 <p>“Did you really not do anything?” Bai Yunfei grabbed his right shoulder and began to use his Wave Treading Steps to further increase their speed.</p>
 <p>A glint of appreciation flashed through Jing Mingfeng’s eyes as he nodded his head, “I really don’t know. I didn’t even have time to do anything. If anything, when the people inside saw me, I only saw two of them discussing something. They were extremely strong, and I was safe for a moment. In the next moment, a large group of people suddenly started to chase me…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was furious with Jing Mingfeng in his heart, but he didn’t doubt the claims he was making. Turning back to look at the group of people chasing him, there was a sullen look in his eyes. He had been recognized as an accomplice of Jing Mingfeng. If the two of them were to be overtaken, then he wouldn’t even have time to explain himself with the way things were right now. He’d be beaten and killed first.</p>
 <p>“Nothing good has ever happened since I bumped into you!!” Bai Yunfei glared at Jing Mingfeng. Bai Yunfei wanted nothing more than to punch his look alike in the face, but when he saw the helpless and regretful expression on Jing Mingfeng’s face, he let out a sigh. “We’ll settle our debts later! For now, we’ll have to shake off those guys behind us!”</p>
 <p>“Your movement based soul skill is fast enough, you go first. Since their target is me, I’ll pull them away and escape by myself…” Jing Mingfeng looked at the group behind them and then turned back to Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even try to think yourself to be so sickeningly righteous! Do you really think that they’ll let me go!?” Bai Yunfei snorted. Then with a softer voice, “I still want you to explain to that young miss and aunty the troubles you gave me in any case! Don’t you know I was labeled a pervert because of you!?”</p>
 <p>“Er…” Jing Mingfeng looked a little embarrassed by that, but his gratitude for Bai Yunfei had increased nonetheless.</p>
 <p>“Talk less bullshit and run faster. We’ll never throw them off this way!” Bai Yunfei urged.</p>
 <p>Grudgingly, Jing Mingfeng said, “I’m hurt, so I can’t run as fast. For the sake of shaking them off earlier, I’ve already used up the most of what my elemental wind has to offer…”</p>
 <p>“Tsk!” There was a hint of anxiety in Bai Yunfei’s mind. If this continued, even if they were to reach the city gates, they still wouldn’t be able to shake off the people chasing them. If he were to abandon Jing Mingfeng and run away, then he would for sure be able to escape them. However, this very thought had been immediately overruled in his head. If he were to do this, then he would be no better than someone who would sacrifice everyone but himself or herself to save their own hide. Indeed, he wouldn’t do such a thing. Even more importantly, the situation had not yet reached a bleak impasse despite his anxiety.</p>
 <p>His eyes began to repeatedly flash. As soon as they reached the entrance to a street, Bai Yunfei had already made a decision. With a shake of his right hand, two rings appeared in them. Thrusting them over to Jing Mingfeng, he commanded, “Wear it!”</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Jing Mingfeng had been completely focused on the terrain in front of him without consideration of anything else. So when Bai Yunfei took the rings all of a sudden, he had been taken back. Staring strangely at Bai Yunfei, he asked, “What did you say?”</p>
 <p>“Stop your bullshit and wear these rings! One ring per hand!”</p>
 <p>Seeing the serious face of Bai Yunfei, Jing Mingfeng’s eyebrows pinched together as if he was thinking about something. Without any more words, he took the two ring and quickly put them on his forefingers.</p>
 <p>The moment he put on the rings, Jing Mingfeng’s eyelids flew up in surprise. Flabbergasted, he could sense a strange sensation fill his body and forcibly increase his speed by a fraction!</p>
 <p>“Wear these two as well!”</p>
 <p>This time Jing Mingfeng did not hesitate to take the two bracelets handed to him by Bai Yunfei and quickly put them on.</p>
 <p>His speed increased again!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Wha… how could they still accelerate in speed!” The mid-stage Soul Sprite couldn’t help but cry out when he saw the two increase in speed once more.</p>
 <p>After several more minutes of chasing them, the two males grew farther and farther away from them. The chasers revealed looks of worry as they saw their targets start to escape. With a look to the others, one of the chasers began to use his soulforce to try and overtake them.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to chase them anymore…”</p>
 <p>Just then, a faint voice could be heard from the air behind them. Startled, the men came to a stop. The others in the group heard the voice as well, causing them to grind to a stop and look up behind them.</p>
 <p>Standing several meters in the air, one figure in black and another in violet came walking across the sky.</p>
 <p>The person on the left was a middle-aged man dressed in violet. His hair was slightly white, and a two-inch scar could be seen on the left side of his face. Expressionless and emotionless, this was the man that had just spoken. Each step he took through the empty air possessed a tint of purple light that formed underneath his feet as if forming a platform for him to walk on.</p>
 <p>The other man was dressed completely in black, and his face was rather hard to make out. Similar to the first man, there was a faint glow of golden light under his feet that allowed him to traverse the sky.</p>
 <p>Slowing down, the two figures traversed another hundred meters before coming to a stop above the group of chasers.</p>
 <p>“Milord…” The leader reverently called out.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man nodded in acknowledgement. “Take your men and go back. Take heed to make sure that no other soul cultivator was alerted.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” The group did not hesitate to respond. Without any further words, they all began to leave the area with speed.</p>
 <p>“What do you think? Did that one hear what we were talking about?” No longer caring for the group beneath them, the man in black and the man in violet began to walk toward Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng, who were still running away.</p>
 <p>“It matters not if they heard it or not. All that needs to be done is to kill.” The figure in black spoke; there was a distinctively young-sounding voice to this one.</p>
 <p>“Yes. The only thing that remains to be seen is if they have any more colleagues. Let us follow them for now. If there are no more, then kill them straight away.”</p>
