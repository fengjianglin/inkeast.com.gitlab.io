Eyes flashing red with determination, he drew the Fire-tipped Spear out from his space ring and blocked the sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang!!”</span></p>

Though the sword was powerful in its horizontal stroke, the spear was strong in its own might. Bai Yunfei advanced a step once with his left foot and then lashed out with a right fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!”</span></p>

His left hand was slightly black in color, and the following collision saw to red and black light mixing with one another as they blasted away from the epicenter. The two men were stuck together for one silent moment before they were forced apart due to the blast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang! Bang! Bang…”</span></p>

Any stone beneath his foot was reduced to powder with how much force he was putting in each step. Ten powerful steps were taken by him before he finally came to a rest, sufficiently surprised by how much power Bai Yunfei had met him with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A Soul King?! Impossible! How does he have the strength of an Early-stage Soul King?!”</span></p>

He had put all his might in that attack, but Bai Yunfei had somehow met his attack with an equally powerful strike!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Soul Exalt shouldn’t be capable of reacting fast enough to stop his sword stroke or even punching him with enough force to push him back. Even the most powerful of Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt shouldn’t be capable of such a feat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It went beyond what a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt should be capable of. Even his aura was showing him to be on the level of an Early-stage Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he a Soul King just like me?! Impossible! I refuse to believe it!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was finding it hard to believe Bai Yunfei was possibly the same level of strength as he was. He focused on Bai Yunfei for a moment, searching desperately for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that was when he noticed it. The look of pain on Bai Yunfei’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He understood then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew it! It has to be that power boosting soul skill of his! What a powerful soul skill, it’s strong enough to temporarily bridge the gap between the levels, it can have a Late-stage Soul Exalt have the power of a Soul King for a brief moment!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was all the more surprised by that tidbit. He felt a little better now in fact. The cold sneer was back on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if you use a double-edged method like that, will you even be a match for me? How naive…no matter how much you struggle, you’ll still die in the end!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Filled with a renewed vigor to kill Bai Yunfei, the man took off towards him to try and kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s a dark-type soul cultivator!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei realized. The explosive start of this person along with the other times they fought had revealed to Bai Yunfei that the person was a user of elemental darkness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all the explosions setting off one after another in the pocket, the battle before seemed nothing more but a battle between ants. The giants were now duking it out against one another for supremacy. Between the spatial distortions and fractures, the shadows of the two fighters couldn’t even be seen besides from the hint of red and black light that’d collide with one another. The space would ripple like a stone across a body of water every once in a while, distorting the pocket even more and more while the stone on the floor were all reduced to powdered dust. This pocket was quickly being reduced to nothing more but powder…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least a hundred blows had been exchanged by the two in the last ten seconds. Even up against a Soul King, Bai Yunfei was surprisingly managing to hold his own while in his Berserk Mode!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it came to fighting Soul Kings, Bai Yunfei had already his fair share of experience. He had Xiao Qi and Long Lan helping him those times normally, so this was the only time where Bai Yunfei was truly fighting a Soul King by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So this was the true testament to Bai Yunfei’s strength. He could fight a Soul King to a stand still!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though he wasn’t at the disadvantage, that didn’t mean to say Bai Yunfei could afford to loosen up. Compared to the Soul King, Bai Yunfei looked far grimmer, and even a tad bit frantic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t like the Soul King who had a decent grasp on the situation around him. He knew the pocket was quickly folding on itself with parts of it already less than ideal to be around. With each passing moment Bai Yunfei was in the pocket, Bai Yunfei grew more and more frantic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know just how much longer the pocket would be able to hold out, and he didn’t even know how he’d be able to deal with that. He wasn’t capable of teleporting, and he didn’t know how to manipulate spatial energy. How to escape the spatial fissures was beyond him. If the pocket were to collapse, how would he get away?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only ‘comforting’ piece of information was the expression on the man he was fighting. Bai Yunfei had no doubts that this person knew of the impending collapse of the pocket. If he was fighting Bai Yunfei wholeheartedly, then that meant the person wasn’t afraid of the pocket’s collapse. And in that case, Bai Yunfei was somewhat assured that the situation wasn’t as bad as he thought it’d be…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no way Bai Yunfei would be able to ask for an armistice to find a way out of here, and neither was he willing to ask for such a thing to begin with. The only thing left to do was to thoroughly beat down his opponent, but he wasn’t confident in that aspect. If he wasn’t careful, then that black needle of his opponent would surely kill him…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, Bai Yunfei was more than aware that the soul armaments of this person weren’t any weaker than the ones he wore and used!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crimson longsword the man was using was without a doubt beyond a low-heaven tier. It was a mid-heaven tier soul armament for sure. There was also the three jadeite pieces of orbiting soul armaments the man had. They were most likely low-heaven tier with a defensive strength no weaker than the Cataclysmic Seal. The black glove on his left hand was also a heaven-tier. There was also the armor he was wearing, that was a heaven-tier as well. And then the space rings and bracelet the man was wearing, Bai Yunfei was sure those two weren’t weak in grade either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the very first time Bai Yunfei had met someone else with so many strong soul armaments. Even all the previous Soul Kings he killed before had only two or three heaven-tier soul armaments. If not for the circumstances, Bai Yunfei would’ve thought he was fighting against someone else from the Crafting School.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul armament Bai Yunfei was most afraid of was without a doubt the black needle. Not once had Bai Yunfei touched the black needle yet, and neither was he willing to test his armor against it, nor his Ardent Sun Glove, Critical Glove, or the Flameblade Bracer. They were all low-heaven tier in strength, but Bai Yunfei wasn’t willing to use them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Bai Yunfei’s current Berserk Mode, he was comparable to an Early-stage Soul King. The barrier of the Cataclysmic Seal was strong enough to deal with the black needle on a level far superior than before, but still, the black needle was still able to break through the barrier given time. That only went to show just how terrifying the black needle was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t the piercing strength of the needle Bai Yunfei was worried about. He still remembered what happened to the last people to be struck through by the black needle. It was a fatal wound if it got to you, and Bai Yunfei was convinced there was a special effect to the needle he didn’t want to find out about. He had no way of laying his hand onto the black needle without putting his life in danger, so Bai Yunfei was powerless to find out what effect the needle had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the Cataclysmic Seal was the only thing Bai Yunfei could use to protect himself. The Cataclysmic Seal never left Bai Yunfei’s side whenever the black needle came into play. Due to his fear of the needle, Bai Yunfei was rarely able to find an appropriate time to strike back at his opponent. Since his opponent knew that Bai Yunfei had something that could nullify soul attacks, his opponent didn’t bother to pursue that avenue of attack. This rendered the Soul Sentinel Scarf’s ability to deflect soul attacks onto the caster useless if Bai Yunfei wasn’t able to use it in the most crucial moments.</span></p>
