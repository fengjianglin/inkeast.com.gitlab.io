 <p>Chapter 34: Explode! Explode! And Explode!</p>
 <p>In the next several days, Bai Yunfei trained almost as hard as he would in a ‘closed-door session’.</p>
 <p>He studied the method for controlling those ‘basic’ acupoint in meditation almost all the time. And at night, his time was not wasted either. Instead of sleeping, he spent time increasing his soulforce. Because Bai Yunfei spent nearly all his daytime studying acupoints, he basically did not have time to improve his soulforce. However, he had his own method for improving his soulforce with ease!</p>
 <p>This method was naturally the Equipment Upgrade Technique. At the moment, he was staying in this hamlet near Li Chengfeng so he did not have to worry that there would be danger after he passed out. Therefore, he used the Upgrade Technique to exhaust his soulforce directly every night. The next day, by the time he woke up from his unconsciousness, his soulforce would have already improved -- this was really convenient.</p>
 <p>However, there was a little trouble, namely, the numerous items stored in his interspatial ring had almost been used up by him in just several days. Nearly all of these ordinary items were destroyed before they could reach +10, turning into piles of scrap metal as if they had been in existence for countless years before this.</p>
 <p>Later, Bai Yunfei had no choice but to change his method. Before going to sleep, he practiced the body control or the soul skills to use up most of his soulforce, then he used the Upgrade Technique to exhaust his remaining soulforce. Because of this, every night he would ‘jump around’ like mad before going to bed. The villagers who did not know what was going on even thought that he had too much energy and a well-meaning auntie even suggested introducing a girl to him to help him...</p>
 <p>However, the result of such ‘arduous training’ was: after seven days, he could already more or less control the several acupoints in his arms and manage to use the Ninefold Fist Force without suffering too much from the side effect. At last, he had accomplished the first goal. Next he would have to train the acupoints in his legs then begin to practice the Wave Treading Steps.</p>
 <p>His soulforce had been increasing steadily by twenty something points a day. It had been twelve days since he had reached the Soul Warrior stage. In the first five days, which was also the time it took him to go from Luoshi City to this village, he only used the <em>Arte of Training the Soul</em>&nbsp;to improve his soulforce. After the last seven days, now the numerical value of his soulforce was about 1500 points. Bai Yunfei guessed that the threshold for the middle Soul Warrior stage should be about 1600 points. In other words, he would reach the middle Soul Warrior stage in a few days.</p>
 <p>In terms of items, although the chances of successful upgrades were extremely low, after many upgrades, he still ended up with more than ten +10 items such as sabers, swords and sticks.</p>
 <p>Perhaps inspired by Bai Yunfei, Li Chengfeng trained very hard too. He even spent much less time with his precious Ling’er. However, Ling’er was a good wife so she did not complain about this at all. She was also sincerely happy upon seeing the joyful expression he had when training together with Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>By the time of Bai Yunfei’s arrival, Li Chengfeng had already been a Soul Personage for a while. Recently he had been practicing the bone-blood control method and the Overlapping Waves Art he had just obtained, all while having to improve his soulforce through cultivation. Even so, after the first two days, he still broke through to the mid-stage Soul Personage level. His power had been increasing steadily. This even made Bai Yunfei wonder if he might also possess a shortcut capable of improving soulforce like the Equipment Upgrade Technique...</p>
 <p>This day, in the afternoon, Bai Yunfei went into the mountain forest behind the village alone, found a secluded place and sat down with legs crossed -- at the moment he wanted to do an important thing -- upgrading his items -- upgrading those +10 items!</p>
 <p>All along, Bai Yunfei had considered +10 the limit of the upgrades. Now that he already had quite a few +10 items, he decided to upgrade them to even a higher level so that he could gather even more information about the Upgrade Technique. Anyway, these were all ordinary items so even if they exploded, he would not be too distressed by this.</p>
 <p>Gently taking a breath, he turned his wrist over. A dagger appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p><em>“Let’s get started with a +9 dagger... Upgrade.”</em></p>

 <p><em>“Upgrade!”</em></p>

 <p>After half an hour, there was already a large pile of scrap metal in front of Bai Yunfei. And he was grinding his teeth looking at a saber about one meter long in his hand with an expression full of anger.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>This large saber was none other than the one used his battle against hallmaster Zhong. There were still some nicks on the edge of the blade and there was a hole through the blade caused by the Glacial Piercer.</p>
 <p>After staring at the large saber for a good several minutes, Bai Yunfei finally could not help standing up with a whoosh. He threw the saber fiercely to the ground and shouted abuse at it,&nbsp;<em>“F*ck you! Is there a mistake here?! Five +10 ordinary items of mine and even the two Icesoul Silver Needles were destroyed! They were soul armaments! Soul armaments, damn it! Both of them were destroyed! Now the only thing left is this crappy saber?!</em></p>
 <p><em>“Damn it! Damn it!”</em></p>
 <p>The more Bai Yunfei thought about it, the more agitated and angry he became. He raised the large saber and roared in a deep voice,<em>&nbsp;“Upgrade!”</em></p>

 <p>The large saber turned into scrap metal and drifted to the ground, which emptied his hand.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s expression stiffened then became even more unsightly, his eyes almost filled with blood. With a shake of his wrist, the Glacial Piercer appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>“I, I...”</p>
 <p>Because he was holding the Glacial Piercer with too much force, his hand was almost white and blue veins had popped out of his arm. His entire body was trembling slightly.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s expression changed repeatedly. After struggling for more than ten minutes, he was finally able to suppress the impulse in his mind. He sat down on the ground again dejectedly, put the Glacial Piercer away then looked at the pile of scrap metal in front of him in a daze.</p>
 <p>After a long time, seeming to have thought of something, he turned his wrist over and an object appeared in his hand -- it was angular, dazzlingly red and chillingly cold -- it was none other than one of those bricks!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had a special feeling for bricks. After all, in the beginning, only because he had accidentally upgraded that brick to +10 had he been able to catch Direwolf by surprise in the Coliseum and kill him to survive. Therefore, he had been keeping a brick in the interspatial ring. Even though it was not that brick, it could be considered a commemorative object.</p>
 <p>“Hah...” Bai Yunfei gave a self-derisive laugh, slightly shook his head and thought in his mind,&nbsp;<em>“Upgrade...”</em></p>

 <p>“Er...” Bai Yunfei’s expression stiffened a bit, but he did not care too much about this success. He continued to think in a somewhat frustrated manner, “Upgrade.”</p>

 <p>“I... Upgrade again!” His expression changing, Bai Yunfei roared like mad.</p>

 <p>“... ... ... ...”</p>
 <p>“... ...”</p>
 <p>After being stupefied for half a minute, Bai Yunfei acted the same as before. He stood up with a whoosh, threw the brick to the ground fiercely, stamped his foot and shouted abuse.</p>
 <p><em>“F*ck you! Are you kidding me?!?!”</em></p>
