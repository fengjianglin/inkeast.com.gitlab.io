 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

He could easily kill Bai Yunfei through a strike in the throat with the power of the elemental ice gathered around his right hand, but Bai Yunfei could not say the same with his spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before his hand could even strike Bai Yunfei, the Soul King’s eyes widened in abject horror and surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason behind his surprise was simple. The crimson red spear that should’ve been stopped by his barrier had simply gone straight through it as if the barrier hadn’t even existed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His elemental barrier was strong enough to defend against most low-heaven tier soul armaments, but it was good as gone when the spear stabbed through it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a surprisingly unexpected hair-raising situation for him. His back grew slick with sweat as the spear continued towards him. Even with how strong he was physically, getting stabbed through the chest with a spear would be extremely painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King realized then that his current attack to kill Bai Yunfei would be foolhardy in the face of this spear. Bringing his hand back as quickly as lightning, he brought the hand to his chest to try and defend himself with the elemental ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clang!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a sound of collision as both Bai Yunfei and the ice-type Soul King froze in place in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fire-tipped Spear had stabbed straight through the elemental ice around the Soul King’s hand, but it stopped just half an inch away from the Soul King’s heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It hadn’t stabbed into him!!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just those two fingers, he had stopped Bai Yunfei’s almost-certain killing move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had been so excited when the spear stabbed through the Soul King’s barrier, but then when it was stopped by him, the look of excitement immediately turned into one of horror. The strongest move he had in his arsenal had been stopped almost effortlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ability of the Fire-tipped Spear to ignore elemental defenses had worked multiple times in the past, and none of Bai Yunfei’s foes had been one the wiser when hit with it. But…..this Soul King had grabbed at it so easily between his two fingers! How could Bai Yunfei not feel bad?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shock hadn’t slid off the face of the Soul King either. Though he made it look simple, catching the Fire-tipped Spear between his two fingers had actually needed him to use more physical strength than he was normally accustomed to using. He rarely used his physical body to fight ever since he became a Soul King, but there was no helping it this time. His elemental defense had ‘failed’, leaving him no order choice. It was only fortunate that he managed to defend himself, else he would’ve been sorely hurt….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noticing the look of shock on Bai Yunfei’s face, the Soul King’s eyes flashed dangerously with a hint of ice. Murderous intent flooded the air as he stared at the Soul Exalt who had forced into such a state. Not only was this humiliating, it was unforgettable. He’d make sure this whelpling would die in the most painful way possible for him to actually feel appeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King roared, his right hand twisting so that the Fire-tipped Spear was wrestled away from Bai Yunfei’s hands and knocked to the side. And then, now with his hand freed up, the Soul King slammed his right hand onto Bai Yunfei’s chest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His hand had been filled with elemental frost when it slammed against Bai Yunfei’s chest. Even if Bai Yunfei didn’t have his organs broken to pieces, he’d be rendered into an icicle anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And because of Bai Yunfei’s earlier usage of the +13 additional effect of the spear, Bai Yunfei’s soulforce was already a quarter of what it normally was. He was left unable to defend himself with his Fire-tipped Spear being too far away to be brought close, so he could only grit his teeth and take in the stockpiled soulforce in the Violet Soul Ring into his body. He took a half step back with his left leg, drawing elemental fire to the Critical Glove on his left arm. All charged up, Bai Yunfei lashed out to punch at the Soul King’s palm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an action wasn’t lost on the Soul King. A Soul Exalt who was trying to compete in strength against a mid-stage Soul King? It was a surprising way to die, but if Bai Yunfei wanted to do so, then so be it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sneered, the murderous intent in him growing even heavier. He could tell from the golden light shining from Bai Yunfei’s left arm that the glove on it was a powerful soul armament, but that didn’t dissuade the Soul King. The sneer on his face grew even more sinister as his eyes flashed dangerously, the white light around his right hand immediately turning into a baleful wisp of black energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The change had been instantaneous. The moment when both their hands clashed with one another, the black energy around the Soul King’s right hand was transferred over to Bai Yunfei’s left hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But at the same time, Bai Yunfei snarled, the soulforce in his body draining into the glove even more to make it shine unbelievably bright!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">+12 Additional effect of the Critical Glove, activate!!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only difference was that while the Soul King had been forced to stagger backwards, Bai Yunfei was….blown off his feet and through the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eighty-one Fold Fist Force with four times the strength was dreadful to even think about, but the +10 additional effect of the glove hadn’t activated, so it wasn’t the strongest it could possibly be. Though with just those two, the power behind the strike was more than enough to surprise even the Soul King. He wasn’t fatally hurt, but his right hand was already wracked with pain as the force of the blow traveled up his arm and into his body in no time at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King couldn’t believe his eyes, Bai Yunfei had surprised him once again. The power behind the Soul Exalt was far stronger than what any other Soul Exalt the Soul King knew was capable of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even with that shock, the Soul King was already certain that Bai Yunfei would be dead now that his right hand had connected….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

The collision between the two soul cultivators had left Bai Yunfei in both shock and then fear as he watched himself be launched through the air without any control over his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt the black energy from the Soul King’s hand the very instant he touched it. In the next moment, it was as if an unbelievably cold frost had invaded his bones and froze his body. But the more startling thing was the black aura that was sapping away at his energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black….as in elemental darkness!</span></p>
