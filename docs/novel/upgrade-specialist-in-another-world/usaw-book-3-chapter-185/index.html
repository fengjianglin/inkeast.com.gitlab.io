 <p>Chapter 185: Fighting With A Student of the Crafting School</p>
 <p>The incoming attack was a swift one, but the startled Bai Yunfei had been quick to respond. Pushing off of his right foot with speed equivalent to the wind itself, he retreated ten meters behind in an instant. In the next second, he turned his body around to look at where the sword came from.</p>
 <p>“Tink!” The sword embedded itself into the spot where Bai Yunfei was once standing, and in no time at all, a blaze was immediately started in its place. The entire area a meter away from the center was scorched instantaneously, and the sword handle trembled slightly with a buzzing sound.</p>
 <p>At the same time the sword fell, a single person flew out from the side and next to the landing spot of the sword. With a flick of his right wrist, the sword was pulled out from the ground and back into his hands. Armed with his sword, the man retreated several steps so that he’d come to a stop in a protective stance in front of the young girl.</p>
 <p>This newcomer looked to be a rather ordinary-looking person and of the same age as Bai Yunfei. Turning his head for a moment to look at the small pig, he then looked at the tear-stricken face of the young girl with a relieved look on his face. Turning back to look at Bai Yunfei, his face grew angered, “How audacious you are! I don’t care who you are, if you dare bully my junior, you’re going to die!”</p>
 <p>Now that this person was completely in sight, Bai Yunfei could finally see the clothes that he was wearing and who this person was.</p>
 <p>This person was a student of the Crafting School.</p>
 <p><em>“Junior? So this little girl is also a student of the Crafting School!”</em> Bai Yunfei was surprised to say the least. Cupping his hands in greeting to the angered young man, Bai Yunfei spoke, “Dear friend, you misunderstand, I was actually—”</p>
 <p>“Spare me your quibbling you reckless bastard! I, Fei Nian, will be sure to beat some sense into you before I hand you over to master!” Not even allowing for Bai Yunfei to explain himself, the one named Fei Nian immediately charged towards Bai Yunfei with his soulforce erupting from both his sword and body--this person was a late-stage Soul Sprite!</p>
 <p>“I said this was only a misunderstanding, I was—” Bai Yunfei was surprised; he thought he’d be able to explain the situation.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>The sword flashed brilliantly in an arc of red as it stabbed at Bai Yunfei’s shoulder, forcing him to dodge to the side.</p>
 <p>“I was—”</p>
 <p>“Hua!”</p>
 <p>Fei Nian leapt into the air in preparation to land a kick onto Bai Yunfei’s throat.</p>
 <p>“I—”</p>
 <p>“Clank!” The sword came slashing down onto him, forcing Bai Yunfei to block with his bracer.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Now, Bai Yunfei was angry.</p>
 <p><em>“Since when was there such an unreasonable person like this in the world! If you’re not going to listen to reason, then I’ll say it after you’re beaten on the ground!”</em></p>
 <p>Having no other words to spare, Bai Yunfei snorted. His feet slid across the ground as he began to make use of the Wave Treading Steps so that his body flickered at times. When the sword of his enemy came flashing at him in an attempt to stab him, Bai Yunfei made a sixty degree incline backwards to duck under it and made several steps backwards.</p>
 <p>With a shake of his right hand, the Fire-tipped Spear appeared in it. Pushing his soulforce into the spear, Bai Yunfei brought it in front of him so that it’d clash with the fire sword into a dance of sparks. Due to the sword being bolstered by the red light, Bai Yunfei’s body shook from the collision, but he continued to move forward anyways. With renewed speed, Bai Yunfei spun his spear so as to strike at Fei Nian’s waist!</p>
 <p>When the spear came into sight, Fei Nian had a slight look of surprise on his face, but Bai Yunfei’s sudden counterattack forced him to grow serious. Using his sword to block would be fruitless, and so would dodging. So instead, Fei Nian decided to put away his sword and brought out a giant hammer in a burst of light. With a grunt, he slammed his hammer in direction opposition of the spear.</p>
 <p>This was the very first time Bai Yunfei had ever met someone that’d respond to a sweep of his spear like this. With the abrupt change in momentum, the spear was forced out from his hands. But because Fei Nian wasn’t adept with using a hammer, his body gave a slight rotation before he could correct his footing. Turning back to face Bai Yunfei, he put away his hammer in favor for a golden saw-tooth chakram. With a buzzing sound, the chakram was flung towards Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Following the momentum of his spear, Bai Yunfei managed to get a better grip onto it. As soon as he did, the whistling sound of something circular spinning through the air suddenly drew close to him. A golden light began to exude from the blade, and in no time at all, the blade was already nearly at Bai Yunfei’s eyes. Surprised, Bai Yunfei brought his spear up to block it.</p>
 <p>There was a clanking sound before the chakram was repelled away, but the force of it was enough for Bai Yunfei to stagger back yet again. Just as he prepared himself to counterattack, he came to a realization that Fei Nian’s right hand was clenched tightly. He looked as if he was holding onto something, but before Bai Yunfei could even look at it any closer, Fei Nian suddenly gave it a powerful yank backwards!</p>
 <p>There was an ear-piercing whistle coming from behind his head, causing Bai Yunfei to blanch. Instinctively, he tilted his head downwards and brought his bracer up to protect himself. There was a flash of golden light that arced past and destroyed the clothing on his right arm first, and then a flurry of red sparks and a screeching metallic grunt. That golden chakram had been brought back to attack his head!</p>
 <p>Fei Nian held his hand up with his fingers outstretched, revealing a practically invisible thread connecting the chakram to his hand.</p>
 <p>In this battle alone, three different soul armaments were used by Fei Nian alone. Bai Yunfei had used the Fire-tipped Spear and the Flameblade Bracer, but he wasn’t using them to kill his opponent, he was merely just surprised on how this person was fighting.</p>
 <p><em>“So this is how a student of the Crafting School fights…”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up with a strange glow. In all of his past battles, he had fought his enemies with a constant stream of different soul armaments. Never had he imagined that today would come a battle where’d he be on the receiving end of that!</p>
 <p>But still, when it came to soul armaments, Bai Yunfei didn’t have a shortage of them either!</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear was strong, but even if it were to miss a stab at its opponent, the explosive effect would certainly cause trouble for everyone involved. Thus, Bai Yunfei put away the Fire-tipped Spear in favor for several throwing daggers for a battle of long-ranged weaponry.</p>
 <p>Fei Nian wasn’t slow on his part either. Seeing that this person that was bullying his junior wasn’t weak either, his anger for this man caused Fei Nian to feel disinclined to prolong the fight any longer. With a snort, he began to make use of his surefire killing move.</p>
 <p>With a shake of his right hand, a half meter by meter tall black wooden box suddenly appeared right in front of him. In the moment before Bai Yunfei could throw his daggers, Fei Nian immediately pushed all of his soulforce into the box and then tossed the box away.</p>
 <p>Instead of tossing this box at Bai Yunfei, Fei Nian threw the box upwards. Under Bai Yunfei’s surprised look, Fei Nian stuck out his linked-together forefinger and middle finger towards that box and twisted them as if he was twisting a key.</p>
 <p>“Open!” He cried out.</p>
 <p>Following his command, the wooden box began to creak and crackle before opening up. Red light washed out from the box and filled up the entire area around it; in an instant following the cranking sounds coming from within this box, beams of red light shot out from the ‘main body’ as well!</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei managed to get a clear look at these red beams of light, he had been so shocked that the daggers in his hands were dropped to the ground. These red beams of light; they were clearly longswords made of red flashing light!</p>
 <p>There was a spasmodic twitch on Bai Yunfei’s lips as he glared at the sight. <em>“I was planning on using these daggers to stop you, but you’ve clearly one-upped me with this rain of swords!!”</em></p>
 <p>It was clear to see that this box Fei Nian threw out was a sword box. And all these swords hailing down from the skies were the swords that used to be stored inside it!</p>
 <p>But despite Bai Yunfei’s ridiculing moment, all of these seemingly incomplete soul armaments or soul armaments began to drop down from the skies onto him. Grim-faced, Bai Yunfei began to weave left and right in an extreme display of dexterity to dodge everything. Even though it looked exceptionally thrilling, he had to focus on every single movement at the most crucial of moments to avoid being hit. If he got hit, it’d not be for a minor injury.</p>
 <p>Truly, Fei Nian was so shocked by this display that he found it hard to recover from. This was his personalized soul armament, the Unlimited Blade Box. It was an earth-tier weapon to say the very least, but here it was, completely uneffective! He had put in his entire strength, but each sword had been dodged with some sort of strange movement skill, how completely and utterly amazing!</p>
 <p>It was a concentrated rain of swords, but it didn’t last long either. In a few scant seconds, the earth was filled with over three hundred swords, and the sky was already a dark red color from the light of the box. Another two rounds of swords were thrown out before the red light finally scattered away for a ceasefire. With a whistling sound, the box then dropped down from the skies and onto the ground.</p>
 <p>At last dodging the final blade thrown at him, Bai Yunfei was finally able to let out a sigh of relief. But just as he started to let down his guard, a wave of danger suddenly washed back over him again. Looking up, Bai Yunfei suddenly came to realize that Fei Nian was already dashing up close to him with his right hand in some sort of golden glove. As it approached him in an attempt to punch him, this golden glove began to release two rays of red and gold light.</p>
 <p>The irises of Bai Yunfei’s eyes contracted slightly, but he wasn’t too far gone with shock. Taking a half step backwards, Bai Yunfei clenched his right fist and met his opponent’s fist with an equally strong move of his own.</p>
 <p>Ninefold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>But before the eve of collision, the rays of red and gold light suddenly curved outwards to avoid Bai Yunfei’s fist and slammed straight onto Bai Yunfei’s wrist!</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>Practically instances before the fists met, Bai Yunfei could feel his entire right arm go numb as something was transmitted into his body.</p>
 <p>Startled, Bai Yunfei thought to himself, <em>“Crap!”</em></p>
