 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally with Bai Yunfei’s personality, such a ‘ruthless’ scene like this wouldn’t be something he’d do. And the expression on his face could easily be seen by anyone that knew anything about him that he had lost all sense of rationality. It was as if some sort of vicious personality within Bai Yunfei’s mind had broken loose and was now releasing a world of pain onto these insignificant ‘nobodies’ and deal significant injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai remembered his grandfather saying before that because of the Soul Refining Palm, Bai Yunfei’s soul was damaged. Consequently, Bai Yunfei would have to deal with a variety of side-effects as his soul repaired itself—some of which were appearing now in the form of him losing emotional control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Bai Yunfei’s case, the small amount of anger and desire in Bai Yunfei was now manifesting in several degrees greater than what would normally be shown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Bai Yunfei hadn’t shown anything out of the ordinary since he recovered, Zheng Kai figured his grandfather had been wrong about his guess. But Bai Yunfei’s situation right now only proved that his grandfather was right about Bai Yunfei losing control over his emotions and actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai had additionally figured that Bai Yunfei would deal with the situation as he would. But now that things were progressing aberrantly, Zheng Kai was beginning to worry that Bai Yunfei might kill these seven. It was an extreme reaction to a relatively minor case, and it wouldn’t be favorable to Bai Yunfei either if he killed them. While not too obscenely strong, Cao Jun did have some backing of sorts that could go after Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei stepping on Cao Jun’s arm and leg heavily enough to break them had been more than enough for Zheng Kai to bear. Striding forward, he spoke up, “Yunfei, that should be enough. They’ve been properly punished, let’s forgive the—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t finished speaking when Bai Yunfei stared at him with the same expression on his face….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the moment Bai Yunfei stared at him, Zheng Kai felt a sudden chill crawl up his spine, shutting him up instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Bai Yunfei’s face had been freakishly monstrous. Not only was his left eye dyed with blood, but even his right eye was starting to grow scarlet as if he was transforming into a beast. There was still not even a hint of emotion on his face, he looked nothing more like a beast getting interrupted by someone as it was about to have its meal. He stared Zheng Kai down with a bone-chilling glare. “It’s my business, don’t interfere!!” He snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah—you got it!! I won’t, I’ll be good. You do you…” Zheng Kai obeyed with a ‘smile’. In that one moment he was snapped at, Zheng Kai felt as if he was about to be attacked. If he were to try and ‘speak’ again, Bai Yunfei would’ve used that strange soul armament in his hand to riddle him filled with holes….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Helpless to the situation now, Zheng Kai could only give a pitiful look at Cao Jun on the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How unlucky of you, I can’t save you even if I try. May you have luck in saving yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was in fact in shock at the situation. He hadn’t thought that the normally kind and harmless Bai Yunfei would become so terrifying like this at the flip of a switch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei snapped his head back, his right foot grinding back and forth on Cao Jun’s arm, creating a bone-chilling sound along with the howls of pain again from Cao Jun. In his actions, it seemed as if….Bai Yunfei was taking enjoyment at this situation!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You made my student cry, so, I’ll take your eyes in return!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A freakish smile came onto Bai Yunfei’s face. The words he spoke had immediately bled any remaining blood from Cao Jun’s face, prompting him to plead with all his might, “Pl—please don’t! Please...please for—forgive me. I was wrong! I was wrong!! Please….please forgive me….please…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his pleas fell on deaf ears. Bai Yunfei’s right hand stretched forward with his index finger burning slightly with elemental fire at the tip. Extending towards Cao Jun’s right eye, Bai Yunfei was prepared to stab and burn out the eyeball!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In—instructor Bai….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a meek voice called out to Bai Yunfei, somehow stopping Bai Yunfei for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked up. Fang Tianmeng, who had been hiding for most of the time, was now slowly making her way forward, her face looking deathly white from her terror. Staring fearfully at Bai Yunfei, she couldn’t help but yelp again in fright when met with a cold stare from him. She stepped back twice, her delicate body trembling mightily as if she had just seen a ghost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she didn’t shy away from him completely. Somehow managing to overcome her fear, she raised her head up to look back at him. “Instructor Bai….you...you can let him go….it’s...it’s enough already….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a sensible person. She knew that if news of this event were to get out, Bai Yunfei would get into a great deal of trouble. So even if she was terrified out of her mind, she just had to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei stared emotionlessly at her for two seconds. As if suddenly realizing something. He was doing this for his student after all, and if she was saying it was enough, then shouldn’t he stop?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Confusion and hesitation ran across Bai Yunfei’s eyes for a moment. Emotions ran conflict with his mind as he tried to think about the situation. Pained, Bai Yunfei’s body began to shake, his feet taking several steps away from Cao Jun. Shaking his head, Bai Yunfei looked like he was starting to turn back to normal if his eyes were any indication.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kneading his eyes as if to try and remove the remaining blood, Bai Yunfei blinked several times, revealing mostly-white eyeballs rather than scarlet. For what seemed to be the first time, he looked around himself and then to Fang Tianmeng, “Fang Tianmeng….what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fear in her eyes had been a very noticeable hint to Bai Yunfei that something was wrong. He was curious and confused on what was going on. He turned around even more, only to realize that everyone here was staring at him with similar fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked to Cao Jun and his miserable group of companions in mute shock. Narrowing his eyes as the realizations started to hit him, Bai Yunfei slapped his head as if in pain, “I….remember. I did all of this….I….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was completely stunned at his actions. While it was true he did these things, Bai Yunfei didn’t want to believe it. Though he did these things, Bai Yunfei had only wanted to teach them a small lesson, not do something do drastic to a degree like this. And if his memory served him correctly, then with the murderous intent that had been in him, Bai Yunfei really was on the verge of killing the group!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I….what have I done?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rubbing at his temples in his incredulity, Bai Yunfei began to feel like hundreds or even thousands of insects were starting to wriggle around his head. Even in the depths of his soul, he was starting to feel like something was moving ‘away’ from him, something strange that was gradually starting to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whew….Yunfei, you’re finally back!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just then, the relieved voice of Zheng Kai spoke out, turning Bai Yunfei in his direction. Zheng Kai was already walking towards him with a look of concern and worry for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zheng Kai, I feel a little strange….” Bai Yunfei spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai waved his hand, “Let’s leave this place first. I’ll explain it to you later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes….” Bai Yunfei nodded, taking one last quick look around before to Fang Tianmeng and the other young man with her, “Let us leave here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The worry and fear on Fang Tianmeng’s face gave way to relief when she saw that Bai Yunfei was back to normal. Nodding, she and Ye Yu followed Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai away from the alleyway.</span></p>
