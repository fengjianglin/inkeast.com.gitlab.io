 <p>Chapter 308: There'll Always Be An Unexpected Windfall Admist the Buyout</p>
 <p>Compared to Redfire City, Mo City was many times bigger in size, economy, and city life.</p>
 <p>Out on the streets, Bai Yunfei and Tang Xinyun walked shoulder to shoulder as they laughed and chatted with one another. Every so often, Bai Yunfei would remark on a particularly popular sight or would comment on some scenery. When he did mention something, Tang Xinyun would quip a quiet line or two about each place like a tour guide giving a tour. In a way, her being more willing to talk was a sign that she was feeling better after returning home, else she wouldn’t have been so ‘interested.’</p>
 <p>Not even a meter behind the two stood a ‘burlish’ figure in simple clothing. At first glance, this person looked like a farmer aunty coming to the market to sell her wares for the day, but she stuck to Tang Xinyun like a shadow.</p>
 <p>It was Zhao Mancha.</p>
 <p>Nowadays, Zhao Mancha didn’t treat Bai Yunfei with the same ‘guarded’ feeling as she had before. The things Tang Xinyun had said to her about Bai Yunfei had surprised even her, and even though she was quick to anger and quicker to speak because of her personality, she wasn’t someone that wasn’t completely unreasonable.</p>
 <p>After careful consideration, she had to admit that Bai Yunfei wasn’t too bad of a person. After the debacle yesterday with the Hua, Zhao Mancha had gained a new level of respect for Bai Yunfei since he went and did all those things for the sake of Tang Xinyun.</p>
 <p>Since Bai Yunfei didn’t have any accessories left to ‘upgrade,’ he had Tang Xinyun take him to a place where he could buy more. The place she had in mind was known in Mo City as ‘Jewelry Street.’ The street was a kilometer long and contained eighty percent of Mo City’s jewelry traders.</p>
 <p>Both sides of the streets were filled to the brim with all sorts of jewelry stores as far as the eye could see. Not only were there jewelry stores, there were also small vendors on the streets with sparkling ware lined up on a counter.</p>
 <p>Under the illumination of the morning sun, each piece of jewelry reflected an extremely illustrious light.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei browsed the two sides of the streets as he wished. He soon came to the realization that the highest grade accessory was only of ‘superior’ quality. Not a single ‘rare’ grade item could be seen.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei noticed that some of the smaller vendors on the streets had some superior grade items after buying a few from the store, but the censors products weren’t as gorgeous or as precious as the ones sold in the stores.</p>
 <p>Distinctions like those weren’t a problem since Bai Yunfei only wanted accessories based on their grades. With that in mind, Bai Yunfei bought them as he wished.</p>
 <p>Despite money not being a limiting factor anymore, Bai Yunfei still found it hard to spend lavishly. He tried to save money if possible. It was inherent to his nature. Something that persisted with him despite the wealth he accumulated.</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun would follow Bai Yunfei to each store as well. She never bought a single item, but she still window shopped while he was busy doing the actual buying.</p>
 <p>It confused Zhao Mancha since she didn’t understand why Bai Yunfei was buying all of these accessories.</p>
 <p>Could he be buying them for Tang Xinyun?</p>
 <p>It didn’t seem like it…</p>
 <p>Searching each piece of accessory for their stats was second habit to Bai Yunfei now. Time was not an issue, so he could take his time and move as slowly as he liked. With each piece of accessory going through his hands, Bai Yunfei could test to see if it was a superior item or not. At first, there hadn’t been a problem with what he was doing, but after going through several vendors, the owners were starting to gossip to one another.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had already bought almost half their wares!</p>
 <p>By the time Bai Yunfei reached halfway down the street, he and the ones around him were the topic of discussion on the streets. Each vendor would stare curiously at Bai Yunfei. Even passersby would stare strangely at him.</p>
 <p>The males all revealed looks of scorn on their faces; Bai Yunfei was practically flaunting his wealth by buying out the majority of the vendor’s stock, and the females were all looking jealously at Tang Xinyun next to him with sighs.</p>
 <p>If only they had a wealthy boyfriend that would treat them as well as he did.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s selection speed wasn’t too slow, but the street was extremely long. This gave the many store keepers Bai Yunfei hadn’t reached enough time to pull out their wares.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei did reach them, the amount of wares he looked over was such a large number that Tang Xinyun found it extremely ridiculous.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Yunfei continued to pick out accessories without a care in the world.</p>
 <p>An unknown amount of time went by before Bai Yunfei finally reached the end of the street. By now, everyone was staring at him as if he was a monster or something similar.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, can… can we leave now?” Unable to withstand all of the strange looks she was being given, Tang Xinyun tugged at his robes, pleading with him.</p>
 <p>“Hm?” Snapping out of his thoughts, Bai Yunfei suddenly realized all of the strange glances being thrown in his direction. Scratching his head in embarrassment, Bai Yunfei smiled, “Haha, alright. Let me buy from one more store and then we can leave.”</p>
 <p>The owner of said store let out a sigh of relief. If rich Mr. Money Bags didn’t buy anything from his store, the owner would’ve puked blood straight from his mouth.</p>
 <p>Refusing the owner’s kind introduction, Bai Yunfei began to look through each of the accessories.</p>
 <p>Not long after, Bai Yunfei walked up to the counter with nearly a hundred new accessories to buy. Happily calculating the final bill, the store owner was in such glee that he relented and discounted the price to eighty percent.</p>
 <p>With all of the accessories stored in his space ring, Bai Yunfei was about to walk out of the store when the shop owner suddenly stopped him.</p>
 <p>Sneaking a glance around first, the man then whispered to him, “My lord, this store of mine has several more rare goods. Would you be interested in perusing them?”</p>
 <p>“What?” Bai Yunfei asked, “What rare goods? Let me see them.”</p>
 <p>Chuckling, the man replied, “They’re some recently unearthed oddities. I was planning on taking them to the more knowledgeable stores to appraise them, but if my lord has some interest, I’ll let you look at them first. If any catch your eye, we can agree on a suitable price.”</p>
 <p>The man took out a tightly wrapped bag from underneath the counter. He unfurled it to reveal several more accessories. Many of the items were caked with dirt or were faded from age, but nonetheless, each of them possessed the aura of ‘antiquity.’</p>
 <p>Just from aura alone, they looked as if it had been years since they had last touched air.</p>
 <p>The first two items Bai Yunfei picked up were disappointing to say the least. Whether they were artifacts from another time or not wasn’t relevant to him. Many of the items he picked up weren’t even ‘high’ grade, and only a small few were of the ‘superior’ quality.</p>
 <p>With a frown on his face, Bai Yunfei picked up a dirt-encrusted earring before he decided he would leave.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>“Eh?” Bai Yunfei froze up. Renewed interest flickered across his eyes as he inspected the earring in his hand.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When buying things in large amounts, there’ll always be a rare quality good.</p>
 <p>That was a fact!</p>
 <p>A great big smile had been carved into Bai Yunfei’s face when he walked out of the store. Happy beyond happy, Bai Yunfei never would’ve thought that he’d come across an accessory-type soul armament while he was buying accessories to upgrade; what luck!</p>
 <p>“Bai Yunfei?”</p>
 <p>A skeptical voice suddenly called out to him.</p>
 <p>Each of the three curiously turned their heads toward the source of the voice. They saw a young man in blue robes not too far away from them. He was staring at Bai Yunfei in confusion as if unsure of what he was seeing. Right next to him was a younger woman dressed in pink robes.</p>
 <p>“You’re… Zhao Xiluo!!”</p>
 <p>The name came to Bai Yunfei after a moment of consideration. This was the very same Zhao Xiluo Bai Yunfei had come across way back in Gaoyi City!</p>
 <p>“Haha, it really <em>is</em> you!” Zhao Xiluo roared with laughter before racing up to them. Bowing in greeting, Zhao Xiluo smiled, “Brother Bai, I never imagined that I’d meet you here, talk about coincidence!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei smiled in return, “Haha, it really is. I didn’t think you’d still remember me, brother Zhao.”</p>
 <p>“You’re a young hero, brother Bai. How could I possibly forget?” Zhao Xiluo asked, “It’s been, what, a year since we met in Gaoyi City? How fast time goes…</p>
 <p>“Actually, did you ever join the Crafting School, brother Bai?”</p>
 <p>This question caught the attention of the female next to him, earning Bai Yunfei a strange look.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I managed to gain a spot in the Crafting School last year on the eleventh month.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? As expected of you, brother Bai! Everyone on the continent knows that the Crafting School is the hardest school to get into! Of course, that’s probably because of how specific their test for testing ‘crafting’ talent is.” Zhao Xiluo chuckled in admiration.</p>
 <p>“Ah, speaking of the Crafting School, you should definitely meet this person!” Zhao Xiluo added after that.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he beckoned to the girl next to him, “This is the disciple of our Water School’s second elder, Kou Tingting. She’s…”</p>
