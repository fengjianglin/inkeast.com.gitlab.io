But unfortunately for him, him putting so much power into his attack meant being hit with an equal amount of backlash, hurting him enough to drop a third of his normal fighting efficiency. It wasn’t a fatal amount, but still something that noticeably weakened him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know how to expect such a thing. He hadn’t any idea that this could even happen. As a Soul King, he had to admit he was absolutely shocked. And by the time he could reattune himself to reality, a giant ‘wall’ was already coming straight for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mid-heaven tier soul armament!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The power behind the Cataclysmic Seal was astounding, and before he could do anything but put both arms up to defend himself and try to retreat to widen the distance between him and the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite his best efforts, the brick was flying far too fast for him to escape. Mercilessly, the Cataclysmic Seal crashed into the front of him, sending him flying forward with the brick as it traveled. The two of them slammed into the ruins of a nearby building with a resounding crash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The feeling of contact was felt by Bai Yunfei through the connection. It hadn’t done much damage, but it did its job. Waving his right hand, Bai Yunfei called the Cataclysmic Seal back to him in its regular size so that it didn’t use up any more soulforce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, he and Zheng Kai were both standing on the rooftop of a building two hundred meters away from the Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the Cataclysmic Seal was gone, the ice-type Soul King stood there among the ruins with a blank look on his face. When he looked up and saw Bai Yunfei standing there, anger registered in his eyes. The Soul King hadn’t expected to suffer any damages by the hand of these two little Soul Exalts. Furious, the man sneered and flew towards Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai with the power of flight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of the backlash from his previous soul attack attempt, the Soul King was afraid of using another soul attack without knowing more about the situation or having a secondary piece of insurance. In either case, he’d use his own strength and control over elemental energy to beat the two Soul Exalts. In those two aspects, he was still a lot stronger than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damnit!! Who are these people?! They’re even willing to fight us while inside the limits of the Capital!” Zheng Kai cried out in exasperated anger. “We have to run, brother Bai! If we can just buy ourselves some time, the Soul Kings in the Capital will come! There’s plenty of them among the guards, and a battle like this will definitely catch their attention. We’re safe as long as they get here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Bai Yunfei didn’t seem to agree with Zheng Kai’s plan. “If they’re willing to attack us, don’t you think they’ve planned it out already? Do you really think we can outrun a Soul King? There’s no time but to protect ourselves!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He called the fireseed within the Cataclysmic Seal to him. Letting it enter his body, Bai Yunfei felt his strength explode into the stage of a peak late-stage Soul Exalt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going into Berserk Mode!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was powering up, the ice-type Soul King was already making his way towards them with the speed of a demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden increase in strength from Bai Yunfei alarmed Zheng Kai, but not for long. Forcing himself into a state of calm, he withdrew a black folding fan from his space ring and prepared his remaining soulforce to fight against the Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A feeling of dread washed over the two Soul Exalts before the Soul King was even there. Icy crystals were already spreading through the area as if trying to freeze the entire place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chirp!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a furious chirp from Xiao Qi as it flew back into the air. With a flap of its wings, five large blades of space shot towards the Soul King in order to prevent him from reaching Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” The Soul King uttered in slight surprise at the fact that Xiao Qi was capable of such an attack. But before it could reach him, the Soul King concentrated slightly before flashing forward in a burst of strength, almost making it seemed like he teleported twenty meters in one single stride to get to Bai Yunfei! The Spatial Edges of Xiao Qi hadn’t even been close enough to touch his robes and sailed harmlessly away from him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His speed had already been very hard to get a hold of beforehand, but now that he was even faster than before, both Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai were both completely caught off guard. In his fear, Zheng Kai moved to swing his fan to send out a cut in space, but before he could go through with the action, a white ray of elemental energy shot straight through his right wrist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grunting in pain, Zheng Kai dropped his fan, unable to hold it anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another ray of white light had shot towards Bai Yunfei as well, only to have Bai Yunfei try to smack it away with his Fire-tipped Spear. But when the two made contact, the concussive force from the impact had nearly dislodged Bai Yunfei’s spear from his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sneering in disdain, the ice-type Soul King lashed out with his right hand towards Bai Yunfei’s throat, threatening to tear it out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His strength would be more than enough to do that, no matter how strong Bai Yunfei’s defense was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how fast Bai Yunfei and Zheng Kai’s reactions were, they may as well been a child in front of the Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like the claw of an eagle, the Soul King’s hand drew closer and closer to Bai Yunfei’s throat. If he didn’t do anything, then Bai Yunfei would have his throat torn out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was about to bring up his left arm to defend himself, Bai Yunfei felt someone’s arm grab onto his right arm. The world blurred in front of him for a brief moment before he was teleported forwards thirty meters so that his back was no facing the Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Teleportation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His enemy hadn’t been the one to teleport, it was Zheng Kai who brought the two of them away from danger in the nick of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But barely any time after they teleported, the ice-type Soul King turned around and chased after them again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exhaustion filled Zheng Kai’s face. Teleportation required plenty of energy, and with his wounds, the exertion was even worse. He couldn’t use it again and again either since in front of a Soul King, short-ranged teleportation wasn’t very useful….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a short two breaths, the enemy was already back on them. His forefingers were pressed together like a sword, elemental ice flowing outwards from the fingers to stab into Bai Yunfei’s throat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gritting his teeth, Zheng Kai was about to try and teleport the two of them out of the way again when he felt Bai Yunfei’s person split….into three!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bai Yunfei on the right grabbed hold of Zheng Kai and then threw him away to safety!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two raised their spears up high to then stab at the incoming Soul King from slightly different angles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">+12 Additional effect of the Fire-tipped Spear, Doppelganger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dangerous glint entered the eyes of the ice-type Soul King, “You insignificant worm!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Waving his left hand in front of him, a single blade made from ice materialized in front of him. Cutting into the head of one of the doppelgangers, the Soul King noticed the Bai Yunfei in front of him move to strike him through the heart with his spear. Rather than moving, the Soul King opted to aim for Bai Yunfei’s throat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his eyes, the spear wouldn’t be capable of breaking through his elemental ice barrier. And his own hand would more than enough to lacerate and tear apart Bai Yunfei’s throat!</span></p>
