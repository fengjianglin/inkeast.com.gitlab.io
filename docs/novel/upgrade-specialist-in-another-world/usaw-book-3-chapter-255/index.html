 <p>Chapter 255: A Sword Through the Heart!</p>
 <p><em>“Dammit, dammit, dammit!! What kind of early-stage Soul Ancestor has strength like that!? Who is he in the Crafting School! How does he have so many strong soul armaments!!”</em></p>
 <p>The middle-aged man howled to himself in fear as he retreated. Both of his hands were motioning wildly as he tried to force the python to come to his rescue while trying to make the azure bird get away from Xiao Bai long enough to cast several blades of wind at him.</p>
 <p>But that only resulted in the quickshade bird slashing the other bird’s left wing, greatly crippling its strength.</p>
 <p>Several blades of wind did manage to make their way toward Bai Yunfei, allowing the middle-aged man to let out a sigh of relief. He thought that Bai Yunfei would hesitate, but what he saw next caused his pupils to dilate in surprise; Bai Yunfei just tossed three throwing knives ahead at him!</p>
 <p>After he tossed the three knives, Bai Yunfei had the Cataclysmic Seal expand ahead of him to block the four blades of wind. He was successful in his attempt and had enough time to move the brick away just in time to see his enemy dodge the three knives. He was just about to let loose another barrage of throwing knives when his eyes suddenly lit up in inspiration. Changing his plans, Bai Yunfei tightly clenched his spear and sped up so that only ten meters remained between the two!</p>
 <p>His left hand touched the agility bracelet on his wrist to activate the effect of temporarily increasing his speed!</p>
 <p>Even though the man was trying his best to retreat, Bai Yunfei was able to catch up to him with the Fire-tipped Spear ready to stab into his throat!</p>
 <p>The man’s eyes darkened when he realized that both Bai Yunfei and the spear were right in front of him. A flash of orange light radiated from his body before he stomped down on the ground. There was a trembling sensation from his stomp, but after he took another step back, a wall as tall as him immediately rose up to block the spear’s path!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed at the sight, but he didn’t slow down in the slightest. He brought the spear back by just a small amount before stabbing forward again to activate the Threefold Stab.</p>
 <p>One explosion later, the spear effortlessly pierced through the wall. There wasn’t any explosion, but Bai Yunfei didn’t expect the effect to be activated again in this case. It wasn’t a small chance to begin with, but that didn’t mean it would always activate.</p>
 <p>He did have a backup plan if the effect didn’t activate though; if he twisted the spear, he could ignite the elemental fire around the spear to set off another explosion himself!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>The resulting explosion blasted away the rest of the wall. This explosion wasn’t as strong as an explosion from the Fire-tipped Spear’s effect, but destroying a wall like this was still quite manageable.</p>
 <p>Still, the wall did manage to bring Bai Yunfei’s speed down a notch, enough for the middle-aged man’s eyes to light up in glee as he widened the distance. The python was making its way toward Bai Yunfei from behind. If he could hold off for just another two breaths, he’d be able to escape danger and use the python to hopefully strike at Bai Yunfei when he dropped his guard!</p>
 <p>From the small dust cloud that was kicked up when Bai Yunfei blew apart the wall, three figures came leaping out to charge straight at the shocked man!</p>
 <p>The +12 Additional Effect of the Fire-tipped Spear: Doppelganger!!</p>

 <p>“Mirror images!?”</p>
 <p>The man cried out as he realized what was going on. He could see that the three of them were without a doubt real, but the problem was which one was the real body.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” Just then, the python’s tail came swooping in to slam into the back-most Bai Yunfei. There was a ‘bang’ from the impact before Bai Yunfei was flung away!</p>
 <p><em>“Ah, the one at the back was the real one!”</em> The man smiled in glee. As he prepared himself to attack with the python, a scorching heat suddenly rolled through the area as two of the red spears stabbed at him from right in front of him. These two spears were without a doubt not an illusion since they were so hot and sharp!</p>
 <p>Startled, the man twisted his body to the right in an attempt to dodge. He managed to dodge the spear coming at him from the left while using his left hand to grab at the right spear, but when his hand swept out to grab it, only air met his hand!</p>
 <p>Three seconds had passed, meaning the doppelgangers would now disappear!</p>
 <p>“Tzk!!” In his distraction, the spear from the left stabbed straight through his left shoulder!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s doppelgangers had caused his enemy to be distracted twice before an injury could finally take place. It was unfortunate that the explosion effect didn’t trigger. The man would be dead if it had.</p>
 <p>“Aghhh!!”!</p>
 <p>Pain coursed through the man as he let loose a furious roar. Scratching at the spear embedded in his shoulder, the man tried his best to pull it out, but to no avail! A breaking point had been reached in the man, causing his entire body to explode in orange light as his soulforce washed through the area. His right arm swelled several times larger than before his light-infused arm moved to punch Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>Beast tamers didn’t enjoy fighting at close combat very often, but this man was still a mid-stage Soul Ancestor. In terms of pure strength, he was stronger than Bai Yunfei! If Bai Yunfei was hit with the man’s attack, he’d be unable to accept it without harm.</p>
 <p>Despite that, Bai Yunfei remained as calm as ever. The very notion of dodging didn’t even occur to him.</p>
 <p>Instead, Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up as he watched his enemy’s right fist come at him. Taking a slight step back with his left foot, Bai Yunfei brought his left arm up before punching out with his own right hand!</p>
 <p>“Pow!”</p>
 <p>The two fists clashed together in a brilliant collision. The man’s fist was filled with anger, but even that was fully returned by Bai Yunfei’s Ninefold Fist Force. As such, both men staggered back half a step, but the Fire-tipped Spear in the man’s shoulder prevented him from moving too far back.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s left arm ached from the exertion of trying to keep the spear in place. A mid-stage Soul Ancestor’s strength couldn’t be underestimated it seemed.</p>
 <p>With how things were looking right now, the other man wasn’t taking this collision with ease either.</p>
 <p>Since his enemy wasn’t making a move, Bai Yunfei decided to be the first to lead the counterattack!</p>
 <p>Summoning the Cataclysmic Seal to his right hand, Bai Yunfei reverted it to its normal mode and slapped it straight into the man’s face.</p>
 <p>Due to his shock about the current chain of events, the man wasn’t able to see what type of powerful soul armament Bai Yunfei was using. Unable to make heads or tails of its mysterious nature, the man brought his arms up to protect his face from the blow!</p>
 <p>“Pow.” When a slight tap was felt, the middle-aged man felt surprise in his heart again. He didn’t really feel anything when he was hit, not even pain!</p>
 <p>That moment had only been that, a moment. As soon as the moment passed, the man suddenly felt his body start to fly into the air without a single warning! Without a doubt, the man felt perfectly fine before some sort of mysterious power spread throughout his body. He hadn’t even the time to readjust himself before his legs separated from the ground and his body spiraled into the air as if by some sort of irresistible force!</p>
 <p>While lifting off, the spear was dislodged from his shoulder, making the man cough out a mouthful of blood. When the spear was pulled from his shoulder, parts of his left hand wrapped around the spear were nearly taken off as well.</p>
 <p>Preparing to use the Threefold Slap on the man again, Bai Yunfei was suddenly caught off guard by the python’s tail when it connected with his waist. Grunting, Bai Yunfei was sent flying in the same direction as his enemy!</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Yunfei had taken a direct hit from a mid-stage fifth-tier soulbeast. His soft-leather soul armament was strong in defense, but not strong enough to leave him completely uninjured. From the amount of blood that escaped his mouth and the cracks he heard, Bai Yunfei felt several of his ribs break.</p>
 <p>Due to the brick, the middle-aged man had been sent flying into the sky. He was at a loss of the situation and simply didn’t know what was going on beneath him. It didn’t take long for him to recover thanks to his veteran experience as a fighter. Upon seeing that the python had slapped Bai Yunfei away, he was slightly relieved knowing that the crisis was pretty much over.</p>
 <p>As long as he could get the python to imprison Bai Yunfei again, he’d have a good chance at attaining victory!</p>
 <p>But there was something amiss!</p>
 <p>When his eyes saw the look on Bai Yunfei’s face, he was surprised.</p>
 <p>Even with the blood that was trailing from Bai Yunfei’s mouth, Bai Yunfei could be seen smiling?</p>
 <p>“Wh—”</p>
 <p>“Tzk!!”</p>
 <p>Unnerved by this, the man dropped back down on the ground. He hadn’t even had the time to think properly when a sound barely audible to anyone else was heard.</p>
 <p>To him, this sound may as well be as loud as a rumble of thunder in his mind!</p>
 <p>Growing rigid in the face, the man slowly tilted his head down—only to see a bright-red sword stabbed straight through his chest.</p>
 <p>Blood could be seen dripping from the point of the sword, and in the illumination of the red light, the blood seemed especially eccentric.</p>
 <p>Right behind him, a figure in white could be seen grasping a sword. The funny thing was this person was wearing such a shabby-looking strawhat.</p>
 <p>The unfunny aspect was how this person was holding the sword that had been stabbed through the mid-stage Soul Ancestor’s heart.</p>
 <p>This person was… Tang Xinyun!!</p>
