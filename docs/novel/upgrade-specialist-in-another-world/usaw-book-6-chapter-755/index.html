 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person on fire flew ten meters into the air after having been struck. He came flying through a boulder before finally down onto the ground, spent in both momentum and energy to even consider getting back up to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man had been punched with a flaming fist from Bai Yunfei. He drew his right hand back to step half a step backwards just in time to dodge a tiger claw poised at his chest. His left hand drew the Fire-tipped Spear up to stop the gray-robed man from stabbing him with his sword from his left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He punched outwards with his right hand, slamming it into the tiger right on its waist and drawing a pained roar from it before he sent it flying away. Not even drawing his hand back this time, Bai Yunfei swung it to the side to block a blade of wind with the Flameblade Bracer. The attack bounced uselessly off from the bracer before he kicked off the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His leap upwards into the air hadn’t been fast enough to prevent something from slamming into his back. Rather than do any harm to him, the blow merely aided Bai Yunfei in his leap up to go a few dozen meters. He landed softly on the ground and turned to stare at the remaining two soul cultivators and two soulbeasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A minute had gone by since Yue Feng left Bai Yunfei to deal with the five soul cultivators and two soulbeasts, and in that time, Bai Yunfei had managed to only just deal with one of the Late-stage Soul Exalts. Not only had he managed to do so while dodging the fierce attacks of the other four, Bai Yunfei had also managed to break out from their encapturing after the deed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gray-robed man was a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt and his soulbeast a late-stage class six luminous tiger. There was also a stout man in green robes that was a wind-type Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt with his late-stage class six four-armed wind ape. The blow Bai Yunfei last experienced on his back had been when the wind ape slammed one of its fists onto his back. His armor had nullified most of the damage by dissipating the concussive force in the punch and neutralizing the elemental wind from messing with his internals. All that was left by the end of the punch was just a light jolt that merely served to push Bai Yunfei away more than hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s….strong! How is he this strong? Just how many soul armaments does he have?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A look of disbelief was on the gray-robed man’s face. He hadn’t a single clue that fighting Bai Yunfei would end up like this. In just that one minute of battle, Bai Yunfei had fought with a level of skill far beyond what the group expected from a lone person. None of their attacks even seemed to make a dent onto Bai Yunfei with how he was punching them or blocking with his arms. Even worse, he was essentially shrugging everything off like how he simply allowed a single blow to hit his back to aid his escape. The worse they managed to do to Bai Yunfei was ruin his clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that was when the gray-robed man could see Bai Yunfei’s body. Both sides of Bai Yunfei’s arms and hands had defensive covers on them, and when he took a closer look at them, the man realized that the grade of each of the four soul armaments was at least high-earth tier in quality!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible! Is he….is everything he’s wearing heaven-tier?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man’s lips twitched and spasmed in disbelief at what he was seeing and thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s just a brat relying on his high-leveled soul armaments to fight us! I doubt he’s really strong enough to defeat all four of us! Attack him all at once! Don’t attack where he’s wearing a soul armament! If we kill him….then all of his soul armaments are ours!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a tint of hesitation as he spoke. He gritted his teeth and spurred his soulforce into the golden longsword in his right hand, extending the blade another meter in length with light. Settling into an offensive stance, the man prepared to launch a soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of the other man lit up at his words. He nodded and prepared to attack Bai Yunfei with all he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two soulbeasts growled menacingly, prepared to tear Bai Yunfei to shreds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s head was turned in the direction Yue Feng disappeared to. He couldn’t even sense his aura anymore, which by extension meant he wouldn’t be able to catch up if he didn’t finish up soon. He turned his head back towards the gray-robed man when he heard his shout, but not before casting a quick glance to the right a moment before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it….no point in being merciful. It’s a battle of life or death, so I shouldn’t be holding back either. I don’t really have time to be messing with these people….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the first time since the battle begun, killing intent began to leak from Bai Yunfei’s person. From the Cataclysmic Seal at his side, Bai Yunfei withdrew the fireseed within it and had it melt into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gray-robed man felt a chill go up his spine the moment the look in Bai Yunfei’s eyes took a change. He could see some sort of ephemeral form of fire come out from the strange weapon by Bai Yunfei’s side come out and enter Bai Yunfei’s body, and when he realized what it was, his eyes widened in shock, “Tha—that’s…!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never managed to say the words ‘essence fireseed’ since Bai Yunfei’s aura began to spike rapidly the moment before he could!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dual Flame Artes: Coil Form!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was a man who was already a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt. In his Berserk Mode, he could fight a Soul King on equal levels almost. In his ‘coil’ form, Bai Yunfei could still manage to make do with an early-stage Soul King while maintaining the level of a Peak Late-stage Soul Exalt. In a way, his ‘coil’ form was a mode in which Bai Yunfei was already pushing the limits and essentially a Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Power coursed through his body in unending amounts the moment the second fireseed entered his body. Bai Yunfei looked around himself with a curious glance, he could’ve sworn the atmosphere of the pocket was drawing away from him as if stung from something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As I thought…this pocket can’t handle the energy of a Soul King. How strange, how can such a tremendous pocket like this be so ‘fragile’?” Bai Yunfei muttered. “If that’s the case, I can’t use Berserk Mode or else the pocket will collapse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Bai Yunfei was off thinking to himself, the gray-robed man was already in motion. Kicking off to the ground to launch himself at Bai Yunfei, the gray-robed man unleashed a shower of golden light as his sword danced in the air. Golden swords were starting to materialize all around him before shooting forward to shower Bai Yunfei in a rain of swords!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind around Bai Yunfei was starting to pick up in speed at the same time the gray-robed man took action. A violent gale of wind was kicking up stone and grass within a hundred meters of him, hundreds of wind blades forming as well to cut at the surrounding trees and boulders into pieces before closing in on Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar! Roar!”</span></p>
