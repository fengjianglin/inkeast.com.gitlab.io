 <p>Chapter 325: Friends?! (Third)</p>
 <p>“Lord Bai?! What brings you here?” Wu Gang froze still as soon as he saw Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“You look worried, brother Wu, are you heading somewhere?” The concern on Bai Yunfei’s face grew with each second spent looking at the worried look on Wu Gang’s face. “Did….did something happen to the fireseed spirit mushroom?!”</p>
 <p>“How did you know?!”</p>
 <p>His confirmation caused a stormy look to settle on Bai Yunfei’s face, “What happened?!”</p>
 <p>Wu Gang hesitated for only a moment before he relented to answer, “Lord Bai….the fireseed spirit mushroom was...was stolen by someone before it arrived in Mo City!!”</p>
 <p>“What?!” He roared in anger before realizing now wasn’t the time to be getting angry, “When? Where? And what’s going on now?!”</p>
 <p>Cutting straight to the chase, Wu Gang answered, “We only just received notice from our men who was transporting the fireseed spirit mushroom. A battle’s taking place right now with my father being nearby. I was on my way to ask for assistance from the Tang. The battle is….just five hundred meters away from Mt. Rubble to the south of the city!”</p>
 <p>“How strong are the enemies?”</p>
 <p>“That isn’t known so far….but there’s a middle-stage Soul Sprite supporting our men, so I assume there’s someone of equivalent strength in the opposing side….”</p>
 <p>In other words, the difference in strength between both sides wasn’t too vast…..</p>
 <p>The gears in Bai Yunfei’s mind turned furiously as he thought about his options. “Xinyun,” he turned his head to her, “you and the others should stay here and wait for me. I’ll be back with the fireseed spirit mushroom!!”</p>
 <p>His words were accompanied with a twist of his right hand and a flash of green light as the Tempest Sword came to being in front of him. Jumping onto the blade, Bai Yunfei was about to set off when he felt the back of the sword dip slightly from the weight of another—</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—I</span>t was Jing Mingfeng.</p>
 <p>A jovial slap on the shoulder was given to Bai Yunfei, “Haha, you really think I’d miss out on some action like this? You can’t even use any elemental fire right now, so don’t try playing the hero. Allow me and my new strength help you out this time!”</p>
 <p>Gratitude surged into Bai Yunfei’s mind, but he said nothing and only nodded in response. With a final look to Tang Xinyun to reassure her, both he and Jing Mingfeng flew off towards the south on the sword in a blast of green light.</p>
 <p>Prior to his departure, all Tang Xinyun could say to him when he looked at her was whisper a quiet “Be careful”. Nothing else was said as she clutched at the hems of her robes, but when Bai Yunfei disappeared off into the distance, a look of concern started to show in her eyes.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Since it was the very first time Jing Mingfeng ever rode a flying sword, he found the winds coursing past his ears rather ridiculous at first, but it didn’t take long for him to adapt. Now that he had a solid foothold on the sword, he could spend the rest of his time looking left and right while screaming out in joy.</p>
 <p>“Ol’Bai, you really have the best stuff! Haha, a soul armament that can fly! Even the weakest ones are as rare as a heaven tier soul armament. There’s plenty of treasures in the Crafting School if you have one!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was nervous about the fireseed mushroom, but Jing Mingfeng’s excitement was contagious to even him, “Haha, we’re about to battle and probably kill people, how can you be so relaxed?”</p>
 <p>“Oh stow it. You should know how strong the enemies are by now, shouldn’t you? At best, they’ve three Soul Ancestors. Let me be totally honest, I’m not afraid of any of them. And you! You may as well be the wolf wearing the sheep’s skin. I’ve heard from your very own mouth that you killed even a Soul Exalt before, so who cares for one or two Soul Ancestors? There’s also the people from the Wu, so as long as the enemies don’t run away, wouldn’t capturing them be a pretty easy task?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, are you that confident that they don’t have any other strong people in hiding?”</p>
 <p>“Well…it’s not impossible, but it doesn’t really matter. If we can’t handle it, we run. I’ve faith in my speed, and you’ve your flying sword, what danger is there?”</p>
 <p>“That’s a good analysis, but I hope it won’t be as you say it might….”</p>
 <p>Looking to the front, Bai Yunfei thought, “No matter who stole the fireseed spirit mushroom, I’ll kill them all without mercy!”</p>
 <p>The Tempest Sword was originally a very fast traveling sword, but under Bai Yunfei’s control, it was traveling at even greater speeds than usual. Shrieking through the air for dozens of minutes, Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng soon spotted a small group of people rushing in the same direction they were on the ground below. The person leading this group was a man in his middling ages and looked similar to Wu Gang; presumably Wu Gang’s father.</p>
 <p>Though they were spotted a while before, the Tempest Sword was moving faster than they were, so the group was soon left behind without Bai Yunfei looking behind or slowing down.</p>
 <p>“Brother-in-law, wasn’t that….”</p>
 <p>A purple-robed man near the front of the group spoke out from down on the ground. He was the cousin of Wu Gang, Wu Jian. He was a late-stage Soul Sprite, and the one he called brother-in-law was Wu Gang’s father, Wu Peng, a late-stage Soul Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Looking up as he maintained his current pacing, Wu Peng spoke, “Indeed, that is our ‘client’ for the fireseed spirit mushroom, Bai Yunfei….It’s no wonder he’s a student of the Crafting School if he has a flying soul armament. They should arrive at the scene faster than we will….</p>
 <p>“We should hurry up. Aside from getting the fireseed spirit mushroom, we can’t allow anything to happen to Bai Yunfei lest we suffer the inevitable wrath of the Crafting School!!”</p>
 <p>Not only was Wu Peng a client of the Tang, they were also the ones who were in possession of the fireseed spirit mushroom, so them knowing about Bai Yunfei wasn’t all too strange.</p>
 <p>With a command to the rest of the people with him, Wu Peng had the entire group run even faster in a blur of golden light to charge ahead and leaving behind their weaker members.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng traveled to Mo City from this direction once before, so he was knowledgeable about the area to a certain degree. Under Bai Yunfei’s current speed and thirty minutes of traveling, Jing Mingfeng was able to tell him that there’d be a certain forest of strange stone trees, and that the ‘Mt. Rubble’ Wu Gang mentioned before would be at the peak of the forest.</p>
 <p>As they drew close to the mountain, Bai Yunfei could distinctly hear the sounds of battle explode here and there on it.</p>
 <p>He let out a sigh of relief<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>if the battle was still ongoing, that meant the fireseed spirit mushroom wasn’t yet completely stolen.</p>
 <p>Urging the Tempest Sword forward in a burst of green light, Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng soon found themselves in the airspace near the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Hopping down to the ground a kilometer away, the two hid themselves behind the foliage and suppressed their auras to almost undetectable levels.</p>
 <p>A kilometer away from them, a group of five or six people could be seen. At the sight of these people, Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed slightly while he brought out the Ardent Sun Glove onto his right hand. In a flurry of red light, the nearby elemental fire in the air began to gather around his hand, and in just a single moment or two, a two-meter long fireball was floating above his palm!!</p>
 <p>This was the long-ranged effect of the Ardent Sun Glove where he could use a fireball to attack his enemies. It didn’t require any control over elemental fire to do; just a single thought to activate the effect.</p>
 <p>Without even a word from Bai Yunfei, he brandished his finger forward to send the fireball flying!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!”</p>
 <p>Like a meteorite descending from the skies, the fireball impacted against the ground with such force that the ensuing dust cloud took on the form of a mushroom. The earth quaked tremendously with the nearby mountain side starting to have its loose stones cascade downwards.</p>
 <p>But more importantly, there was a ten-meter long crater from where it struck on the battlefield!!</p>
 <p>Not a single one of the fighters there were too slow to get away from the fireball. Leaping to the edge of the impact radius, they all looked towards Bai Yunfei who was coming back down from the skies in his approach.</p>
 <p>Putting away his Tempest Sword, Bai Yunfei stepped down onto an empty patch of ground to the north of the crater. Because of the crater, he was on the other side of the other five combatants.</p>
 <p>Looking at the five wary individuals, Bai Yunfei was surprised to see that he recognized someone from the five.</p>
 <p>“You guys?” He spoke to two figures on his left.</p>
