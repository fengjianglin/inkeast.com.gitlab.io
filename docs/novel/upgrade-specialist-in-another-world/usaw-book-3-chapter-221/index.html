 <p>Chapter 221: Confusion</p>
 <p>A spark of light clicked in Bai Yunfei’s head. With all the haste he could manage, he shouted out loud,</p>
 <p>“UPGRADE!!”</p>
 <p>……</p>

 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t too sure if it was just an illusion, but when he managed to pull off an upgrade, the oppressing aura around him stopped for just that one moment!</p>
 <p>Even if it wasn’t an illusion, Bai Yunfei was determined to seize this opportunity. If he was drowning in a pool of water, upgrading would be the life-saving piece of reed for him to grab hold of.</p>
 <p>Without hesitation, he shouted out again, “Upgrade!”</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

 <p>As sudden as could be, another notification popped up before the first one could even fully reveal its stats!</p>
 <p>Though shocked, Bai Yunfei gave no time to think about it and thought, “Upgrade!”</p>

 <p>Just like before, another notification had interrupted the first one.</p>
 <p>But when he succeeded in upgrading, Bai Yunfei could feel the pressure around him grow noticeably lighter.</p>
 <p>“It really worked!” Bai Yunfei was astonished and relieved. He had no idea what in the world was going on, but his mind had already come to a conclusion.</p>
 <p>“Upgrade!” He thought next.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade Successful</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Just like how Bai Yunfei had been throwing in materials and equipment when he was crafting, Bai Yunfei was now ‘mechanically’ upgrading each equipment he had left.</p>
 <p>As it were, the situation at hand was completely far beyond what he could comprehend. He couldn’t even begin to imagine just how things could develop to such a point. If his hand were to pull out a moment earlier, an injury from the cauldron would’ve been for certain. Bai Yunfei knew that if the ‘thing’ inside the cauldron exploded, death would’ve been the least of his worries….</p>
 <p>There was no time for regrets or even second thoughts. All he could do now was to concentrate completely on upgrading in hopes of stabilizing whatever it was that needed to be stabilized. It would be even better for someone to notice what was going on so that the elders could hopefully come over and help him….</p>
 <p>The ‘substance’ his right hand was touching was about the size of a small soccer ball by this point. Thanks to his constant upgrading, it didn’t take long for a stern look to grow on his face<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>he was running out of soulforce!</p>
 <p>Notifications popped up in his head one after another so often that it was no longer shocking to Bai Yunfei. Each equipment wavered in between low regalia to middle regalia before, but now, all sorts of equipment ranging from superior to regalia could be had. Neither pattern nor rest could be found here!</p>
 <p>Some of the notifications that’d appear would often be the stats of an equipment after it was upgraded. Sometimes, some would appear as soon as it was upgraded, and other times, notifications would pop up right before another equipment was upgraded!</p>
 <p>It was a chaotic mess of time for Bai Yunfei….</p>
 <p>That wasn’t the only mess, however. Bai Yunfei’s thoughts, the energy in the cave, and even the Upgrade Technique. Everything was in disarray….</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The definite time had been lost to Bai Yunfei by the time his soulforce ran out and his eyes had gone bloodshot from exertion when he ended the last upgrade with a gasping breath.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade Failed</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Destroyed</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>The last string of notification had been for a +10 dagger. It had failed to upgrade, but the ‘sphere’ above the cauldron failed to change in situation. A second notification popped up in Bai Yunfei’s head after that.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: High Rare </strong><br><strong>Attack: 461 </strong><br><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 77 Soulpoints</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>By now, Bai Yunfei’s mind was completely hazy with fatigue. Withdrawing the stockpiled 300 soulpoints in his space ring, Bai Yunfei clenched his teeth, “Upgrade!”</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Upgrade Successful</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: ....</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>The notification continued to pop up in Bai Yunfei’s head one after another. Not even a while later, Bai Yunfei was on the verge of collapsing to the ground. If he were to try and upgrade an item that needed over a hundred soulforce, then he would be completely devoid of any soulforce.</p>
 <p>It was at this time that Bai Yunfei could feel an item fall straight onto his hand.</p>
 <p>A notification popped up then, but the stats of this item caused him to go blank in the face.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>It was the damned +13 brick!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s earlier attempt to ‘save’ the brick had resulted in this situation from happening. But now it had finally ‘returned’ to his hand.</p>
 <p>But….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t feel a sliver of ‘joy’ about this. In fact, he didn’t even feel like taking the brick out at all.</p>
 <p>The chaotic energy had decided to make a ‘counterattack’ whilst Bai Yunfei was in his moment of stupor, prompting him to sigh and say, “Upgr—”</p>
 <p>Not even the final part of the word could be stated when something happened out of the blue!</p>
 <p>A wave of attraction suddenly came from the ‘thing’ and made contact with Bai Yunfei before he could even react. As soon as it touched his right hand, the very last sliver of soulforce was usurped straight from it!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s heart stopped in that one brief moment out of fright. He could feel his soulforce being practically ripped from his body, and the light-headed sensation that came prior to knocking out was knocking at his head. In the moment he began to lose consciously, two final words made its way into Bai Yunfei’s head….</p>
 <p>“It’s over!!”</p>
 <p>It had felt as if the elemental fire all over the cave had stopped in that one moment. The resplendent red light that was shining out above the cauldron was starting to expand and contract over and over again as if it were a tidal wave in a surging storm. Splashing outwards like a red wave, the fire was then immediately ‘sucked’ into the cauldron!</p>
 <p>It was roughly at the same time when Bai Yunfei fell to the ground. He was unconscious. But the red light continued to flood the cave around him, ultimately covering up Bai Yunfei as well.</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>A loud explosion rocked the area and resonated to even the outside of the caves. Startled, all of the students of the Crafting School looked up towards the dark skies. They were just in time to see a bright fiery sun come shining out from the Western Point with a light that could illuminate the surrounding hundred kilometers!</p>
 <p>The light from the sun persisted for a few seconds before it started to ebb in intensity. Gradually, the center of the sun was exposed, revealing the cliff where the crafting caves were.</p>
 <p>But!</p>
 <p>All that was left was half of the cliff side!</p>
 <p>The very topmost part of the cliffs was completely and utterly gone from sight!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had been at ground zero of the explosion. He was out cold from where he laid on top of the ruined cliff side, but it didn’t quite seem as if the explosion had affected him. There wasn’t even a scratch to be seen on him!</p>
 <p>There was an even bigger oddity to be seen there. About a meter in front of him following the explosion, a liquid sphere the size of a soccer ball floated in the air!</p>
 <p>At its conception, ‘it’ had been burning bright with a crimson light. But now, there was a different color mixed in. As ‘it’ continued to pulsate and billow over itself, the other colors could be just barely seen in the red.</p>
 <p>Right underneath ‘it’ was a flame about the size of a fist. It danced and flickered delicately as if it would go out at any second. But at the same time, it felt as if a boundless amount of energy was contained in it.</p>
 <p>Essence fireseed!!</p>
 <p>Somehow, Bai Yunfei’s essence fireseed had detached from his body!!</p>
 <p>There was yet another peculiarity to the place. A few meters all around Bai Yunfei, there was a transparent air bubble that encapsulated him inside. It looked completely disharmonious with the air around it, and anyone that looked at it would feel as if this air bubble didn’t belong in this world.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei, the essence fireseed, and the storming ‘sphere’ were all completely surrounded by this air bubble. From the outside, there as a ripple that moved along the three objects, as if it were scanning the three.</p>
 <p>Each time a ripple glossed over it, the essence fireseed would give a slight jump.</p>
 <p>The sphere itself would try to jump and roar to life, but the air bubble would ‘restrain’ it.</p>
 <p>This transparent ‘entity’ was seen once before<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>it first showed up when Bai Yunfei obtained the Equipment Upgrade Technique.</p>
 <p>It was called the planar laws!!</p>
 <p>If the planar laws were showing up yet again, what new change would it be bringing this time?</p>
