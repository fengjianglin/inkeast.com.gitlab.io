 <p>Chapter 452: Incinerated</p>
 <p>Due to his inexperience with fighting against soul refiners, Bai Yunfei had fallen for the trap, and now his soulforce was being drained away!</p>
 <p>In just under ten seconds, Bai Yunfei’s soulforce was already down to less than half! He’d die if the soul refiner was left unchecked!</p>
 <p>Then when the soul refiner made another push to absorb his soulforce…..</p>
 <p>The black mist around Bai Yunfei’s arm was rapidly condensing when all of a sudden, the Yun’s Soul Ring on Bai Yunfei’s right hand lit up in a brilliant gleam of light, preventing from anymore of his soulforce from being absorbed!</p>
 <p>Yun’s Soul Ring’s +12 additional effect, activate!</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong><strong>10% chance of immunity to a spirit-based attack.</strong>&nbsp;<p><strong>Cooldown of 1 hour.</strong></p></strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p><em>“Now’s my chance!!”</em></p>
 <p>Eyes flying wide open, Bai Yunfei knew then it was the time to strike. Disregarding the fact that his left arm was still enshrouded with black mist, he punched at the soul refiner with a heavy right straight!</p>
 <p>Eighty-one Fold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>The sound of bones cracking accompanied Bai Yunfei’s fist punching the man, and under his startled eyes, the soul refiner flew a hundred meters away from Bai Yunfei!!</p>
 <p>Contrary to what the soul refiner thought, Bai Yunfei had actually been biding his time to wait for the Yun’s Soul Ring to activate. It was an effect that was well worth the agonizing ten second wait since it’d allow Bai Yunfei to attack with all he had!</p>
 <p>Prior to the fight, Bai Yunfei had swapped out several of his equipment for some others more well-suited to fighting a soul refiner. The rings on his were well suited for this battle, with the left granting him “15% decrease to all spirit related attacks”, and the Yun’s Soul Ring with its +12 additional effect.</p>
 <p>The soul refiner came to a stop a good hundred meters away from Bai Yunfei, coughing twice to spit up the blood. From how things were looking internally, his internal organs were in quite a bad shape. The Eighty-one Fold Fist Force had done a great deal of damage to him since he hadn’t been expecting it, and the strength Bai Yunfei showed to him then was nearly enough to destroy his heart completely.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Bai Yunfei wheezed slightly to himself. The feeling of having his soulforce sucked out of him was very unpleasant to say the least.</p>
 <p>Looking hatefully at the soul refiner, Bai Yunfei bent a finger to call the Cataclysmic Seal to him. In response, the brick grew in size before flying at the soul refiner!</p>
 <p>Still looking unwell, the soul refiner gritted his teeth and moved to the side in an attempt to dodge. Due to his present weakness and the Cataclysmic Seal suddenly expanding in size just enough when it passed him, the sword was knocked out from his hand!</p>
 <p>Disarming the man of his sword hadn’t been the only thing the Cataclysmic Seal did, as a stream of fire then wrapped itself around his body!</p>
 <p>+10 Additional effect of the Cataclysmic Seal, activated!</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px; text-align: left"><strong><strong>10% chance to activate ‘Flame Twister’ and restrict the mobility of another by 10% for a maximum of ten seconds upon attacking.</strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Cooldown of 1 minute.</strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>It was with great fear that the soul refiner watched and felt the coil of fire wrap around his body and make him feel even slower than before!</p>
 <p>The wail of a bird behind him gave rise to yet another source of concern then!</p>
 <p>He knew this cry; this was his contracted soulbeast, the shadow vulture! Besides himself with fear, the soul refiner tried to turn his head to see what was the matter when an agonizing stab of pain in his chest halted his movements and forced him to spit another mouthful of blood out!</p>
 <p>The same mournful wail was heard by Bai Yunfei, who turned to look rather than attack. From what he saw, Xiao Qi had managed to land two Spatial Edges onto the throat and left wing of the shadow vulture before its dead carcass fell down to the ground below.</p>
 <p>The thunderfire wolf and Xiao Qi had managed to dispatch the shadow vulture faster than he thought!</p>
 <p>He turned back to the soul refiner who was preoccupied with the sudden feeling of pain he was having. Knowing an opportunity when he saw one, Bai Yunfei stored away his spear to bring his hands together. Formulating seal after seal, Bai Yunfei allowed himself to bask in the warmth of elemental fire as they converged around his arms.</p>
 <p>The Dual Dragon Burst!!</p>
 <p>He was willing to use his strongest move without hesitation. This attack would be undodgeable with the soul refiner’s current state of health, and the Dual Dragon Burst would ensure that he’d die without any further issues!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!!”</p>
 <p>A maelstrom of fire descended upon the plane, covering the soul refiner with the fire left behind by the two dragons.</p>
 <p>But rather than feeling satisfied, Bai Yunfei inhaled sharply, “He’s not dead?!”</p>
 <p>The aura of the soul refiner was very clearly still in the maelstrom! Somehow, the man had managed to pull up enough elemental energy to protect himself from dying.</p>
 <p>“Chirp!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi chose then to dive into this battle, shooting a Spatial Edge to strike at the center of the maelstrom of fire!</p>
 <p>It dove into the eye of the maelstrom, carving out a crescent-shaped hole as it traveled….</p>
 <p>There was a cry of pain, and then after that....</p>
 <p>The soul refiner’s aura was no more!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>The soulforce holding the maelstrom together collapsed, inciting the maelstrom to explode in a flurry of elemental fire into the area!</p>
 <p>Hotter than what the soul refiner’s body could handle, the elemental fire reduced it to cinders, leaving behind only a space ring for Bai Yunfei to call into his hand.</p>
 <p>The ring hadn’t yet fallen into his hand when Bai Yunfei turned an eye to Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>Had Xiao Qi actually been contesting against him for his ‘prey’?</p>
 <p>Both of Xiao Qi’s wings were folded inwardly on itself--the natural pose of Xiao Qi when it entered its meditative pose to ‘level up’.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei shook his head; he’d worry about that issue later.</p>
 <p>Looking all around, Bai Yunfei was this time prepared for any other ambushes. Soulsense on high alert, Bai Yunfei waited for it to warn him of anything.</p>
 <p>The detection of another living being came quick, much to Bai Yunfei’s dismay. Whirling around towards the direction of it, Bai Yunfei withdrew his Fire Eagle and fired off a bullet to the east!</p>
 <p>“Skreee!!”</p>
 <p>From the area Bai Yunfei fired at, the shrill cries of a soulbeast made itself known to Bai Yunfei before a bat-shaped figure took off farther towards the east.</p>
 <p>But the bullet from the Fire Eagle continued onwards to chase down the fleeing soulbeast; this wasn’t an ordinary bullet, it was a homing bullet!</p>
 <p>“An early-stage class five blood bat…..” Bai Yunfei murmured, “I’m being overly cautious if I’m getting riled up over an ordinary soulbeast….”</p>
