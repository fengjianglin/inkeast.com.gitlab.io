 <p>Chapter 471: Devotion of the Heart and Carnal Advances?</p>
 <p>Sneering, Bai Yunfei fed soulforce to his feet, and in a burst of purple light, he...disappeared without a trace!</p>
 <p>Disappearance was a bit of a misnomer. What really happened was that no one there saw what Bai Yunfei did. His actions had been fast enough to evade their eyes before he came to a stop right by the earth affinity Soul Exalt with a solid punch to his waist!</p>
 <p>Eyes dilating in shock, the man brought his sword back reflexively, hoping to slash at Bai Yunfei with the return stroke. But Bai Yunfei’s fist slammed unflinchingly onto the flat side of it!</p>
 <p>“Claangggg!!”</p>
 <p>Like the ringing of a bell, the sword echoed as it bounced, rebounding into the Soul Exalt’s chest! Even more surprising was the fist-shaped indentation on its face!</p>
 <p>Struck by the deflected blade, the man was sent flying backwards with a splurt of blood coming out from his mouth!</p>
 <p>Surprised that such an outcome could happen, he dragged his feet against the ground, slowing his momentum. He looked back up only to see a crimson-red spear come straight for his eyes!</p>
 <p>“Aaahhhh!!!” Furious with how he was being forced so much, he brought his sword up to protect himself once again, his soulforce bringing up another barrier of elemental earth.</p>
 <p>“Pcht!”</p>
 <p>The sickly sound of spear stabbing into flesh was heard then. In disbelief, the Soul Exalt looked down first at the barrier in front of him, then to the spear that had stabbed through both that and his sword to penetrate his chest.</p>
 <p>The blood drained from his face first, and then his life drained from his eyes….</p>
 <p>“Y-you!” The other Soul Exalt came to a grinding halt. The sight of his brother struck dead by Bai Yunfei’s spear left him practically speechless, and his actions to help his brother left uninitiated.</p>
 <p>His words was met with an ominous glare from Bai Yunfei, who turned to meet him. Feeling the area around him suddenly turn dark, the man looked up, only to see a giant ‘stone’ appear out of nowhere to come falling down onto him!</p>
 <p>It was as though a bucket of icy water was dumped onto him. Without consideration for anything else but his escape, the man tossed himself away from the impact zone. The burst of elemental water he was about to attack Bai Yunfei with was instead used to attack the object so that it’d hopefully delay its fall by just a moment longer.</p>
 <p>There was an explosion as the elemental water smashed against the underside of the Cataclysmic Seal, failing to slow its descent down by even a millisecond. The man was happy to find himself outside the impact area by this time though, so he wasn’t too upset with his failed attack.</p>
 <p>But before he could rejoice, the Cataclysmic Seal flashed red with light before expanding in size once again!</p>
 <p>“Boom!!!!”</p>
 <p>With a sickening crash, the gigantic Cataclysmic Seal collided into the earth, burying the Soul Exalt out from sight and extinguishing his life like a candle!</p>
 <p>He had been killed!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Only a minute had transpired before the battle was over. In that one minute, two mid-stage Soul Exalts met their demise at the hands of Bai Yunfei before they even know what hit them!</p>
 <p>It took only a simple few attacks for Bai Yunfei to kill the first Soul Exalt; the Eighty-one Fold Fist Force and a stab from the Fire-tipped Spear to be exact.</p>
 <p>And the Cataclysmic Seal was all it took to take care of the next.</p>
 <p>He hadn’t even needed to use the ‘coil’ form, pleasing Bai Yunfei with how strong he had gotten!</p>
 <p>He did use the +13 additional effect of the Fire-tipped Spear though, meaning he had to sacrifice half his soulforce into order to disregard the barrier and kill the man behind it.</p>
 <p>A battle concluding this fast had its consequences. While Bai Yunfei looked quite at ease with himself, his soulforce reserves was substantially lower than what it was before.</p>
 <p>Taking the two dead Soul Exalts space ring into his own, Bai Yunfei turned around. As he made his way back towards the flabbergasted woman, his body swayed a little with fatigue, his face clearly showing the fact that he was not completely fine. But he still managed to make his way over without stumbling.</p>
 <p>The woman stood there, completely silent and still other than her eyes. They followed Bai Yunfei from where he was to where he walked to without ever stopping. What she was thinking about at that moment was a complete mystery.</p>
 <p>But then when she saw Bai Yunfei sway a little, she decided then to finally speak, “My lord, are you alright?!”</p>
 <p>Her feet were already in motion as she spoke. Taking two steps forward, she suddenly gave a pained yelp before her injured leg gave out and sent her tumbling.</p>
 <p>Narrowing his eyes, Bai Yunfei flew to her side, grabbing her by the shoulder so that she wouldn’t fall. Slowly setting her down, Bai Yunfei spoke, “Worry about yourself first, how are you?”</p>
 <p>“Th<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>thank you, my lord. I….I should be fine, aside from a few small injuries….b<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>but they shouldn’t trouble me too much….”</p>
 <p>She fidgeted shyly, trying to disengage herself from Bai Yunfei’s hands with reddened cheeks. Her speech was stammered out, but whether it was from her pain or from her embarrassment was a mystery.</p>
 <p>It was only when she twisted away from him did Bai Yunfei see some tears in her robes, especially in the area where her chest was supposed to be hidden. A sword must’ve torn through it earlier just enough to unearth her snowy-white skin. The area most revealing was where two ‘mountains’ were, and the valley in between….</p>
 <p>A sight paired with such a beautiful face would’ve mesmerize any single man, and even Bai Yunfei found his breathing hitch a bit….</p>
 <p>“Ahh!!”</p>
 <p>It was then that woman noticed the state of her dress. Both of his arms flew up to cover her modesty, but with how weak she was feeling now, her legs gave up, seeing to her drop to the ground completely.</p>
 <p>Subconsciously, Bai Yunfei grabbed hold of her in a semi-hug.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright? You must be quite injured, let me help you.” He spoke, his hands preparing to send soulforce into her body to hasten her recovery.</p>
 <p>“No! That’s fine…” The woman spoke up suddenly and pushed herself away from Bai Yunfei’s hands, “Thank you for your concern, my lord….but I practice a very particular style of cultivation and cannot accept the soulforce of another….”</p>
 <p>“Oh? A style like that exists?” Bai Yunfei asked, “You said you’re….from the Aroma School in the Northern Ridge Province?” He asked curiously.</p>
 <p>She nodded. “I am. My name is Fen Die, an apprentice of one of the elders. I came with my sisters to the Soulbeast Forest through the Skywards Mountains in hopes of finding a soulbeast to contract with. But….but we never thought we’d be ambushed…..My sisters were killed, and their killers….they….they wanted to humiliate me….I tried my best to run away, I did. I managed to make it out from the Crack in the Sky, and if not for you, my lord, I…..I would most likely not have been able to escape from them….”</p>
 <p>She started to shudder, as if traumatized by her experience and what would’ve befallen her if not for Bai Yunfei. Half-choked with tears, the woman looked extremely pitiful, and any man would’ve long since been hit with the urge to console her with a hug.</p>
 <p>Even Bai Yunfei found himself breathing slightly heavier than usual….</p>
 <p>“My...my lord….were you not hurt by those evildoers earlier?” She inquired, looking up to face him with concern.</p>
 <p>Quirking an eyebrow, Bai Yunfei smiled, “I might’ve exerted myself a little bit, but I’m still fine. Thank you for your con<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>”</p>
 <p>He hissed softly, feeling his soulforce slacken slightly enough to draw sweat to his brows, though he covered his discomfort just as quickly as it appeared.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for him, the woman noticed his discomfort. She bit her lips, as if hesitating for a moment, and her breathing grew slightly faster when she looked again at him.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei looked curiously at her, she looked back with a flushed expression, “My lord, I...I can perhaps help you with your healing….”</p>
 <p>“Hm?” He asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“Do you know why, my lord, I said I could not accept the soulforce of another?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t.”</p>
 <p>“It is because….we of the Aroma School have a very unique style of cultivation. If we take in the soulforce of another, especially that of a male, then….then we start to feel lust, lust that we cannot escape from….”</p>
 <p>“Ah??” Bai Yunfei’s jaw dropped slightly open.</p>
 <p>The flush on the young woman’s face grew to her neck with her embarrassment. Summoning up her courage, she looked at him straight in the eye, her own eyes filled with timidity. “Our Aroma School is very well-suited to dual cultivation and in healing situations. It can increase the potency, especially if its our….our first time….</p>
 <p>“My lord, you saved me from those evil men, and you were hurt as a result….I….I am will<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>willing to give my heart to you, my lord….”</p>
 <p>“Er….” His mouth still half-way open, Bai Yunfei wasn’t sure what to say and stared at the woman.</p>
 <p>Her hands had already dropped from her chest. Both of her ample breasts were trembling erotically for Bai Yunfei to see as the woman waited for his answer. Her upper teeth bit down softly at her bottom lip, and just faintly, Bai Yunfei smelt the soft aroma of something strange, nearly intoxicating him.</p>
 <p>“Hu….huff…” His breathing grew more and more labored, his face reddened like a tomato now. A never-before light in his eyes while he looked like he was trying to fight with himself over something.</p>
 <p>“My lord….”</p>
 <p>Her voice sounded melodic to the ears and as hypnotizing as magic.</p>
 <p>Unable to contain himself any longer, Bai Yunfei found himself stretching his right hand out to swipe at the tattered parts of the young woman’s clothes!!</p>
