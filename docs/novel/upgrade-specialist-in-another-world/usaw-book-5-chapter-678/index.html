Only sparing a moment to widen his eyes, Cheng Xin whirled to face the man and brought out a golden longsword to send a wave of soulforce at the killer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whoosh!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden energy wave flew out from the sword with great power to attack Qiu Bailu. Without even caring to see if it landed or not, Cheng Xin turned direction and leapt out the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took only a moment for Qiu Bailu to reflexively dodge the blow. Heading for the right, he aimed another sword swing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this was a failure as well. Cheng Xin was already too far away. As it so happened, Zeng Fei was now the closest one to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Bailu turned on him without any further consideration. Stalking for Zeng Fei with an outstretched hand, he lashed out to grab at Zeng Fei’s throat! Like a savage beast, all Qiu Bailu cared about was landing his prey!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!!! Get away from me!!” Zeng Fei shrieked. He had been relieved to see Qiu Bailu go after Cheng Xin first and was planning his escape, but then when Qiu Bailu turned his attention onto him, Zeng Fei was terrified. Bursting with soulforce, Zeng Fei tried to emulate what Cheng Xin did to beat Qiu Bailu back. Unfortunately for him, he was far too weak and lacked a good soul armament, so Qiu Bailu caught up to him in a flash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah—…” The terrorized scream from Zeng Fei came to an abrupt stop. He hadn’t the chance to dodge and was powerless to stop Qiu Bailu from gripping onto his throat. There was a sharp crack as the pressure in Qiu Bailu’s grip tightened, and then in a nasty spray of blood, Zeng Fei’s throat was reduced to a pulp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than ten seconds, three of the people were already killed!!</span></p>

Giving each other only a brief look, they ran off into the opposite direction while Qiu Bailu came exploding out from the window behind them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hrnf…..Huuuu…”</span></p>

His soulforce was fluctuating crazily as blood began to drip from each of his seven apertures! Not even caring in the slightest for his own state of being, Qiu Bailu glared with his bloodied eyes down at Li Chen. Locking down on his target, he took off like a bullet to give chase!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin hopped onto the roof after he split ways with Li Chen. Qiu Bailu going after Li Chen had filled him with joy, and since he hadn’t any intentions to help Li Chen out, Cheng Xin took off into the skies to get as far away as he could possibly get. He could feel several powerful guards stationed within another part of the property—two of which were late-stage Soul Exalts—if he could just get to them, he’d be safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahh!!!!”</span></p>

Qiu Bailu had caught up to Li Chen and had a fist of his punched straight through him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin’s heart nearly came to a stop at this frightening sight. Any last vestige of color was now gone from his face as he redoubled his efforts to run like a madman! Now that Li Chen was gone, Qiu Bailu would be going after him next!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did this happen! How the f*ck did this happen!! Why is Qiu Bailu coming to kill us, why!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin was brought up in the safety of the Capital where no danger had ever been anywhere close to him. For him to have all four of his companions die such violent deaths in front of him terrified the living daylights out of him. There wasn’t any time for him to even think. There was only time for him to run!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To run for his life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two figures came to view up on the rooftops—the two late-stage Soul Exalts he felt earlier. Several other guards Cheng Xin first brought with him were already starting to gather due to the most recent disturbance. None of them had thought that there’d be someone willing to attack this property, but they were quick to come over. And when they saw Cheng Xin running so doggedly as if being chased by the dogs from hell, the guards looked a little farther away just in time to see Qiu Bailu toss the now deceased Li Chen to the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s heart trembled in fright—especially the two late-stage Soul Exalts that were Li Chen’s guards. Their eyes were filled with despair since their young charge was now dead. “Die!!!!” They cried in fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bodies lighting up with soulforce, one person brought out his green longsword to swing it in Qiu Bailu’s direction to send out ten blades of wind!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following his lead, the other late-stage Soul Exalt fired off an orange ball of elemental energy about twenty-meters forward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two powerful auras that were the late-stage Soul Exalts blew past Cheng Xin to attack Qiu Bailu. As they blew past, Cheng Xin sighed in relief and changed directions to head downwards and to the side so the guards could deal with Qiu Bailu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an explosion of power as soulforce blew outwards behind Cheng Xin. Surging with such power that a shockwave was created, the only thing the guards saw was a person completely on fire come charging at them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu Bailu!!</span></p>

Wounds deep enough to see bone could be seen on his body, and his abdomen had been cut deep enough to have a part of his intestine start to trickle out. Even more terrifying, his left arm had been blown straight off to have only his shoulder remain, blood spraying out like a spring of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He….he had simply brute-forced his way through the two late-stage Soul Exalt’s attacks!</span></p>

There wasn’t even a twitch in his face! His soulforce was still fluctuating crazily as if it was….as if it was on the verge of explosion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone could tell that whatever Qiu Bailu was doing was beyond abnormal!</span></p>

His relief was gone as quickly as it came. Anxious as ever, he began to make his retreat with all due haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Qiu Bailu had made a beeline for him and was already right in front of him!</span></p>

Get awayyy!!” Cheng Xin howled at the top of his lungs. As hard as he tried, he simply couldn’t get away from Qiu Bailu and was within arm’s reach in just two seconds. With a right arm dripping with blood, Qiu Bailu grabbed onto Cheng Xin’s shoulder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soulforce spiked violently with elemental fire gathering all around him now.

Knowing that Cheng Xin was there, Cheng Chaochuan gave up chasing Bai Yunfei to hurry back to the villa. In his mind, Wu Shang would’ve been more than strong enough to chase down that one person and come back. His run back to the villa had been a bit long, and it looked like he was a bit too late!</span></p>

No longer able to give the command for Qiu Bailu to hold on, Bai Yunfei knew Qiu Bailu would carry out the command left in his mind as soon as he was out of range. He waited for Wu Shang and Cheng Chaochuan to chase after him before Qiu Bailu could carry out his orders. Hidden in the bushes when the two of them were chasing after Bai Yunfei, Qiu Bailu ran into the villa to deal with Cheng Xin and the others!</span></p>

The Cheng could investigate as much as they wanted, and it was possible that they might link what happened to Cheng Xin and the others to Bai Yunfei, but since they were all dead and the Desert Wolves—who were the only outside link that knew about this mission for Bai Yunfei—were gone, Bai Yunfei was safe. Qiu Bailu had thrown away his life for everyone to see, and his death destroyed any evidence that it was Bai Yunfei that did it all while getting rid of this final headache.</span></p>
