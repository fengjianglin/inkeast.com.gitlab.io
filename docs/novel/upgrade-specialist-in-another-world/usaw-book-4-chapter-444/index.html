 <p>Chapter 444: Battling Xing Yuan Again (Third)</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi was blessed with many factors to give it a speed that’d outstrip that of a late-stage class six soulbeast. It had an affinity for both elemental wind and lightning, meaning that it was already naturally gifted with faster speed than most, and with the Wind and Lightning feathers, Xiao Qi was able to double its speed.</p>
 <p>So in a very short amount of time, Xiao Qi was able to fly extended distances in a flurry of multi-colored light, and far away enough to have the rumbling thunder decrease in volume.</p>
 <p>According to Bai Yunfei’s own calculations, they’ve must’ve flown over a hundred kilometers by now.</p>
 <p><em>“We’re still not caught up….just how far did was the Nephrite Throne thrown for?! If this keeps up, the throne will be taken by someone else!”</em></p>
 <p>A few seconds later, Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up with excitement, “This is….this is Xing Yuan’s aura!”</p>
 <p>Standing up on Xiao Qi’s head, Bai Yunfei looked off towards the direction where he sensed Xing Yuan,<em>&nbsp;“At last! He’s stopped, does that mean the throne has stopped too?!”</em></p>
 <p>That final line of thought gave no small amount of glee to Bai Yunfei. Preparing himself to fight, Bai Yunfei spurred Xiao Qi onwards.</p>
 <p>Since he didn’t know just how Xing Yuan would react to his arrival or if anyone else would be there, Bai Yunfei was careful in having them move carefully. They’d need to move in the most optimal way for an ambush, since rushing to their deaths would be completely counterproductive to their goals of grabbing the Nephrite Throne.</p>
 <p>Killing a beast tamer wasn’t anything bad, in Bai Yunfei’s opinion. And that was before his grudge with Xing Yuan could even be factored in.</p>
 <p>Since Xiao Qi had no way of hiding its presence, Bai Yunfei chose to forgo hiding as well. He didn’t even bother using the Face Change technique. Xing Yuan would know who he was when they fought, so the technique would be useless.</p>
 <p>No one else was within the vicinity, meaning no one would know who Bai Yunfei was if he killed Xing Yuan.</p>
 <p>“No matter the case, I should hurry up and finish up this battle before making my exit!”</p>
 <p>The soulforce within Bai Yunfei’s body was nearing its optimal levels for combat now.</p>
 <p>Xing Yuan was ahead of him, standing ready for combat as well.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>It was with surprise that Xing Yuan realized who the newcomer was. His entire body immediately tensed up after he did, though.</p>
 <p>“It’s him!!”</p>
 <p>While Xing Yuan was in the middle of his confusion, Bai Yunfei was already within a hundred meters of him. Stepping down from Xiao Qi, Bai Yunfei leapt down to the ground.</p>
 <p>At first, he saw the corpse of Bian Dangnan. Then he looked to Xing Yuan’s floating person in the skies, and then to the Nephrite Throne in his hands.</p>
 <p>“It’s you?!” Xing Yuan remarked, completely bewildered that Bai Yunfei of all people would be here.</p>
 <p>“You’re here of all places? As an...early-stage Soul Exalt? And with a soulbeast?”</p>
 <p>But then he smirked, as if ridiculing Bai Yunfei, “A prisma oriole, though? Haha! Brat, where’d you find the balls to even appear in front of me again? Did you think you can beat me now now that you’re a little stronger? You ran away last time, but this time you’re offering yourself up to me! Consider yourself unlucky that….your life will be forfeit here!”</p>
 <p>Xing Yuan suffered plenty of humiliating feats by the hands of Bai Yunfei. Not only was his twinheaded vulture and seven dreamwind hawks killed, the three-eyed bloodlion he had been hoping to get was also slaughtered by Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>And to make it even worse, Bai Yunfei managed to even injure Xing Yuan before successfully escaping…..</p>
 <p>All of this combined made Xing Yuan absolutely furious with Bai Yunfei. So furious that Xing Yuan wanted nothing more than to tear him apart limb to limb if he ever saw him again.</p>
 <p>From the other side, Bai Yunfei stared at him with a look of utter passivity. “You talk too much. I just want to say one thing to you, and it’s the last thing you said to me before.”</p>
 <p>“You!!” He spat, holding his middle finger up, “Are going to die here today!!”</p>
 <p>But the thunderfire wolf was already nearly upon Bai Yunfei and ready to clamp down on him! Xing Yuan had the Nephrite Throne pushed back to its cave as he prepared to take care of Bai Yunfei<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>with how precious the item was, he needed to be extra careful that nothing would happen to it while he fought, else he’d be in hot waters afterwards.</p>
 <p><em>“This time, I’ll be sure to take away all of this brat’s soul armaments!”</em> Xing Yuan decided. This time, he’d definitely kill off Bai Yunfei once in for all!</p>
 <p>Rain was currently falling from the skies, but that didn’t matter much to either Bai Yunfei or Xing Yuan since they were both fire-type soul cultivators. In fact, the rain was probably more beneficial to Xing Yuan, as he had the thunderfire wolf, whose affinity for lightning would come in handy here.</p>
 <p>Xing Yuan smirked. He wouldn’t even need to bother thinking about the early-stage class six soulbeast with Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>So with the utmost speed, the thunderfire wolf’s jaws were ready to clamp down onto Bai Yunfei! Thanks to the relative distance between them and the wolf, it hadn’t been a problem for it to get close!</p>
 <p>“Heh! I won’t be the same as last time!” Bai Yunfei laughed. He was already in the middle of activating his ‘coil’ form when the thunderfire wolf was ready to strike, meaning he could activate it with some time to spare.</p>
 <p>Now armed with the power of a middle-stage Soul Exalt, Bai Yunfei withdrew the Cataclysmic Seal, using its barrier to completely stop the wolf’s fangs and claws from reaching his body!</p>
 <p>Blocked from biting down on him, the thunderfire wolf immediately went for another tactic. Again opening its mouth wide open, a ball of violet light began to shine in it to prepare to fire!</p>
 <p>Shifting his feet, Bai Yunfei traveled immediately to another destination by means of the Flash Step, resulting in the ball of light to sail harmlessly away from him.</p>
 <p>Without any other move to follow it up, the thunderfire wolf could only try again the snap at Bai Yunfei with its jaws!</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Yunfei didn’t bother to dodge. Calmly waiting as the wolf approached, Bai Yunfei took a half step back with his right foot and extended both arms out.</p>
 <p>They collided noisily, with Bai Yunfei being knocked several meters backwards due to the built up momentum. Rather than being bitten, both of Bai Yunfei’s hands were expertly fastened to the jawbones of the wolf!</p>
 <p>“Die!” What Bai Yunfei did was an extremely silly move, and Xing Yuan was all too happy to capitalize on it. Sending the command, he had the thunderfire wolf gather up elemental lightning between its jaws again to fire it at point-blank range!</p>
 <p>A fireball was simultaneously brewing in the hand of Xing Yuan a good dozen meters away.</p>
 <p>Though beast tamers had soulbeasts to use as their main means of attack, they weren’t completely helpless and had other ways to launch an offensive.</p>
 <p>But rather than being intimidated by the ball of lightning forming in front of him, Bai Yunfei smirked. The blue bracelet on his right arm suddenly began to glow and grow in size. Loosening around his wrist, it slid down and over the wolf’s head!</p>
 <p>What he was doing wasn’t an attempt to dodge the ball of light, but to clamp down the Beast Taming Ring over the wolf’s throat like a collar!</p>
 <p>As if a switch had been flicked, the ball of light immediately went out, and its body started to tremble!</p>
