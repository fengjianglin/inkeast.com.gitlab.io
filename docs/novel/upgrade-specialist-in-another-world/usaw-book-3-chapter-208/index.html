 <p>Chapter 208: Rock Slicer</p>
 <p><em>“If you’re going to use me as a stepping stone, then don’t mind me if I use you myself!”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked up at Chen Huanghua with brightly-lit eyes and a smile on his face, “Alright! I’ll compare notes with you then!”</p>
 <p>“Uh…” The sudden change in attitude had caught him off guard, but Chen Huanghua recovered just as quickly with a joy in his heart. “Haha! This is what a disciple should be like! Come then, please teach me well, <em>senior</em>!”</p>
 <p>The two of them moved away from one another so that some distance could be had.</p>
 <p>Chen Huanghua swung his right hand out. A “bang” followed suit as a giant sword suddenly materialized in it. The blade of the sword was nearly as big as door itself, and when it fell to the ground, there was a noticeable crater.</p>
 <p>“This is my soulbound armament, the Rock Slicer! <em>Senior</em> Bai, be careful, my blade knows no end!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Senior</em> Bai, are you really going to fight him?” Asked Si Kongxian. He stared fearfully between the two before whispering in an even lower voice, “He’s a late-stage Soul Sprite. He got a high-earth tier soul armament after his examinations, but turning it into a soulbound armament turned it into a low-heaven tier armament. He’s really strong, I think you should…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei shook his head and smiled appreciatively, “Don’t worry. I’ve faith in myself. Wait on the outside, I’ll be back later.”</p>
 <p>This ‘outside’ he spoke of was the external ring the other students were giving him. There was a five hundred meter area given for the two as an ‘arena’.</p>
 <p>Helpless, Si Kongxian walked off to the side and stared at the two nervously.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Thinking about something, Bai Yunfei took off the Ardent Sun Gloves he wore on his hand and stored it away in his space ring. Noticing the skeptical eyes of everyone that saw his actions, he explained, “This was the heaven tier soul armament given to me as my reward on becoming a disciple. I won’t use it for the sake of a fair match.”</p>
 <p>In a brilliant flash of red, the Fire-tipped Spear appeared in his hand. Twirling it around him and then stabbing it into the ground, Bai Yunfei exclaimed, “This is the soul armament I had when I joined the Crafting School. Well then, junior Chen, please learn all that you can!”</p>
 <p>The fact that Bai Yunfei was storing away the heaven tier soul armament he got as a ‘reward’ for becoming a disciple had infuriated Chen Huanghua.</p>
 <p>Back when he first tried so hard to become a disciple, he had failed to do so. All he got for his troubles was a high-earth tier armament which was later turned into a low-heaven tier soulbound armament.</p>
 <p>Thusly he was angry that someone who could only walk 3.7 kilometers managed to get something he did not!</p>
 <p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. Without another word, Chen Huanghua let out a yell before lifting his sword up into the air. Twirling the sword over his head as if it were a feather, Chen Huanghua’s foot stepped down hard in front of him with such force that a crater was left in the ground. In the next burst of action, he dashed towards Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, he was adept in battles of strength.</p>
 <p>The two of them weren’t too far away from one another, so Chen Huanghua’s explosive leap forward had propelled him exceedingly close to Bai Yunfei. He brought the sword down onto Bai Yunfei, but rather than using the sharp edge of the blade, the flat side of the sword was used instead!</p>
 <p>The very first action Bai Yunfei took had been equally surprising to everyone there. Rather than dodging to the left or right or bringing his spear up to block, Bai Yunfei took a half step backwards with his right foot. Priming his weight on that foot, he swapped his spear over to the left and immediately punched forward with his right fist!</p>
 <p>Ninefold Fist Force!</p>
 <p>“Pow!”</p>
 <p>The metallic ring of the blade striking flesh resonated through the air with a crisp tone, and the entire audience clenched their right fists as if feeling the phantom pain.</p>
 <p>What shocked everyone however, was the fact that Bai Yunfei remained unmoved from his initial position. Both of his legs were rooted slightly deeper into the ground, but Chen Huanghua on the other hand had been driven back three steps!</p>
 <p>“This….”</p>
 <p>Many of the audience had been dumbstruck by the sight. Even the ones watching the fight from their caves quirked their eyebrows up from surprise at the sight.</p>
 <p>Chen Huanghua staggered backwards several more steps before finally stabilizing himself. Even now, his right hand was shaking slightly from the impact. <em>“So strong! What kind of soul skill is this?”</em> He thought to himself in shock.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a habit for Bai Yunfei to yell out the name of the move he was using, so there’d be no way Chen Huanghua would know what it was. Bringing his Fire-tipped Spear up, Bai Yunfei immediately charged towards Chen Huanghua after just a small moment of time for him to regain his breath.</p>
 <p>It was true that Chen Huanghua was jealous and wasn’t accepting of Bai Yunfei’s success, but he wasn’t so arrogant that he’d ignore the skills Bai Yunfei had. Having experienced the first trade off of blows, Chen Huanghua was fully convinced that he should get serious in this match. Grunting out loud, he charged straight at Bai Yunfei as well.</p>
 <p>Crossing paths once again, sword met spear as the two became entangled into a close combat fight.</p>
 <p>Chen Huanghua fought vigorously with an offensive style that was powerful in its offense and all-protecting in its defense. At times the sword could be used as a shield to block. In other words, he had both offense and defense in one single package filled with energetic movements.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Bai Yunfei was like a leaf drifting in the wind. With the Wave Treading Steps, his feet moved one after another so that he was akin to the wind itself. There were times where he’d just narrowly escape danger, but each movement he made had been done skillfully and easily.</p>
 <p>After a dozen exchanges or so, Bai Yunfei began to have his doubts. He noted that his opponent was completely focused on using that giant sword of his rather than using any of his other soul armaments.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t a fight between students of the Crafting School done with soul armaments? Back when he fought Fei Nian, that person had used a multitude of strong soul armaments….</p>
 <p>He had fallen for a misconception.</p>
 <p>Not every student of the Crafting School liked to use soul armaments one after another to fight. Many of them loved to fight with just their soulbound armaments. It was only under the most special of circumstances that they’d decide to use another soul armament. Chen Huanghua was one of those people.</p>
 <p>The soulbound armaments of the Crafting School were strong without a doubt. Even if a soul cultivator were to use a heaven tier soul armament to fight against Chen Huanghua’s Rock Slicer, they’d not be a match for him. Bai Yunfei was of a different make, however.</p>
 <p>His Fire-tipped Spear was also of the heaven tier (after being upgraded), and was also a soulbound armament. In terms of soul compatibility, Bai Yunfei’s spear was much higher than Chen Huanghua’s sword.</p>
 <p>The more Chen Huanghua fought, the more he felt as if he was being choked. His opponent was fighting at an even quicker pace than he was, and his own strength wasn’t able to secure the advantage for him. Their soul armaments were ‘equally matched’, and from the very beginning, Bai Yunfei’s face had been completely calm. This fact alone was enough to make him angrier beyond angry.</p>
 <p>“Don’t get so cocky!!” Right after Bai Yunfei dodged yet another strike from him, Chen Huanghu began to sneer. Exploding with anger, the amount of soulforce rising from his body began to increase in amount. His muscles strained together, and the sword that was raised in the sky came flying down onto Bai Yunfei’s shoulder with even more speed than before!</p>
 <p>In all honesty, Bai Yunfei was beginning to grow confident in the fact that his strength had increased since the past. A smile crept onto his face as he regarded his opponent. Even though Chen Huanghua was clearly stronger than before now, Bai Yunfei wasn’t worried. Gripping onto the Fire-tipped Spear from both sides, he brought the spear up to receive the sword.</p>
 <p>But the amount of power in this blow was considerably large! Even though Bai Yunfei wasn’t forced backwards, his feet dug an inch deeper into the ground. Right before he could deflect the sword away, Bai Yunfei noticed a ‘sinister’ smile creep onto Chen Huanghua’s face. In the next second, the giant sword began to explode into a dazzling light of orange!</p>
 <p>Startled by the sight, Bai Yunfei then felt a rush of elemental earth start to explode outwards from the sword and cover his entire person!</p>
 <p>His very first instinct was to retreat backwards, but even as he started to implement the plan, Bai Yunfei realized that his legs were suddenly unable to move!</p>
 <p>Looking down, Bai Yunfei saw that the ground around his feet were squirming as if something inside was wriggling in it. In an instant, the earth ‘crawled’ up to his legs and sealed them into the ground!</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of the stunned look on Bai Yunfei’s face, Chen Huanghua brought his sword back up. With the same sinister smile and mocking eyes, he swung the sword back down onto Bai Yunfei who couldn’t even move anywhere now!</p>
