 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an art Bai Yunfei invented. By using two Desert Eagles in conjunction with one another, Bai Yunfei was capable of using a ‘soul skill’ capable of attacking multiple enemies at once. This was something he hadn’t used in a long time since he hadn’t the need for it. It was useless against Soul Kings, so there wasn’t much of a point for Bai Yunfei to show off his Gun-Fu, much less bring out the Desert Eagles to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now was a good example of when to use it. He was in a fragile state right now with how much soulforce he had used up, but his enemies were all Early-stage Soul Exalts or Soul Ancestors. There was no point in wasting time or energy using the Fire-tipped Spear or Cataclysmic Seal on them. The Desert Eagles had ‘ammunition’ created from primal stones, so there was no usage of soulforce in their usage. Gun-Fu was the most optimal and fastest strategy against these foes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! Ah! Ah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As proof of that, several of Bai Yunfei’s enemies had already fallen prey to the bullets!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bullets were exceedingly fast, no student would be able to escape it. The farthest student from Bai Yunfei had only a moment to think before he was faced with a screen of bullets with no way out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single student so far had been met with at least a dozen bullets tearing through their flesh!</span></p>

Any student that rushed at Bai Yunfei was dropped with the utmost speed and fell to the ground like drops of rain. Only a few had managed to pull up a barrier of elemental energy to protect themselves, but that only allowed them to fend off a few bullets. Their defenses fell before long and were struck by thrice as many bullets as they defended from and had more holes in them than a wicker basket…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>

His right hand was still pointing at Bai Yunfei while his juniors were all mowed down by Bai Yunfei’s bullets. At this, the only thing he could do was just stare in horror at the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even five seconds and thirty of his fellow students were all dead on the ground! Many of them had at least a dozen holes in their body! He was the only student left alive!</span></p>

He was hyperventilating now as the weight of the situation began to push onto him. “What…” He gaped at Bai Yunfei as he was a ghost, “What are y—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to try and teleport away from this place. It was a waste of whatever meager soulforce he had left and could possibly alert the others of his whereabouts…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s biggest priority right now was finding a safe place. Somewhere where he could recover his soulforce and then teleport away. The Yun’s Soul Ring was already working overtime to replenish his reserves along with the other soul armaments on his person. It’d take perhaps another ten minutes or so before he could be back at full health.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But safety wasn’t meant to be his. Another hundred meters later, Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed as he felt something pop up into his soulsense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! How are they this fast?!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Soul King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only an Early-stage Soul King. Given ordinary circumstances, Bai Yunfei probably could’ve killed the man with ease. But now was a different story. He was so weak that a single exchange of blows with a Mid-stage Soul Exalt was enough to make him stagger a bit without doing much damage. Fighting an Early-stage Soul King right now would mean he’d only be killed without much trouble…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A battle was unavoidable. Using the Core Stone to teleport would only be enough to bring him another few kilometers away, but that would still definitely be within the Soul King’s range of detection. So it was useless…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was he…doomed?!</span></p>

He really didn’t want to fight, but there was no other choice!</span></p>

Things weren’t going the way he wanted it to go, but Bai Yunfei wasn’t about to lie over and let himself go without a fight. Raising both hands up, he began to go through a series of complicated hand seals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining soulforce within his body began to bubble violently within his body. A red hue emanated from his body to stain the air around him. Then a large amount of elemental fire began to materialize in the air to be pulled into his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a snowball rolling down a hill, the amount of soulforce was taking on more and more power with each passing moment!</span></p>
