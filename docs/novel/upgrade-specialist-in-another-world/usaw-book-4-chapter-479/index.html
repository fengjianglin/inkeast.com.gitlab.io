 <p>Chapter 479: Carelessness</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t the only one surprised by the actions of that soul cultivator. The one who spoke on behalf of the Liu looked surprised as well.</p>
 <p><em>“Are these people not together then?”</em> Bai Yunfei thought. Thinking about the matter was pointless, though, and Bai Yunfei decided to ignore the matter. He turned around to let the man come for him.</p>
 <p>This man who was attacking Bai Yunfei was Wu Han. He didn’t care who Bai Yunfei was or who he was with. All he wanted to do was kill anyone that stood in his path and accomplish the mission given to him by his school. Everything else could go to hell as far as he cared. The mid-earth tier ice soul armament he wielded was similar to the Glacial Pricker, but a little longer and translucent.</p>
 <p>This brat in front of him was just a mid-stage Soul Exalt; it wouldn’t take more than ten rounds to deal with him.</p>
 <p>He was a little surprised at Bai Yunfei’s subpar reaction, though. Wu Han had expected to get the drop onto Bai Yunfei when he was speaking to Xing Qiugu and be able to kill him before Bai Yunfei could put up any defenses. But the moment his Arctic Pricker drew close to Bai Yunfei, an orange barrier suddenly stopped it.</p>
 <p>Since the enemy attacked first, Bai Yunfei was disinclined to be polite himself. The Cataclysmic Seal protected him from Wu Han’s attack as he unleashed the Eighty-one Fold Fist Force onto him!</p>
 <p>As Wu Han was about to unleash another attack, Bai Yunfei’s fire-wrapped fist moved to strike Wu Han’s chest!</p>
 <p>Realizing the power behind Bai Yunfei’s fist, Wu Han resolved himself to strike first. Leaning backwards, tried to stab at Bai Yunfei’s outstretched arm before it could hit him!</p>
 <p>“Clang!!”</p>
 <p>There was a metallic clinking sound as Wu Han’s weapon touched upon Bai Yunfei’s arm and gave off sparks. He was astounded, but that was to be normal<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>how could a mere mid-earth tier soul armament overcome the defenses of the Flameblade Bracer?</p>
 <p>“Bang!!”</p>
 <p>And with his failure, Wu Han was rewarded with a sturdy punch straight into his chest! Doubling up in pain, Wu Han’s body was sent flying several dozen meters away before finally coming to a stop.</p>
 <p>Despite how powerful the Eighty-one Fold Fist Force was, it wouldn’t be enough to put down a mid-stage Soul Exalt or even incapacitate him. But it could at the very least hurt him to some degree and make him the loser of this particular exchange.</p>
 <p>The instantaneous exchange between Bai Yunfei and Wu Han wasn’t fully watched by the other people there. As soon as Bai Yunfei started to fight, Xiao Qi flew into action as well. With a clear chirp, it launched a flurry of wind blades towards the other four soulbeasts and soul cultivators.</p>
 <p>Throughout all of this, the blue-eyes wyrm was experiencing a myriad of emotions as soon as it saw Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi. It was happy that Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi was here, and even without the Beast Taming Ring to control its movements, the wyrm still fought quite well with Xiao Qi in the past. Moving just half a beat slower than Xiao Qi, the wyrm roared furiously and unleashed three blades of water and swung its tail to slam into the three-eyed kong bear.</p>
 <p>Fighting a two-against-five was clearly not in the favor of Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan, Bai Yunfei thought. He looked back to the ice-type Soul Exalt in front of him. Since words were useless now, he’d have to defeat this one as quickly as possible so that he could help Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>He of course, was only thinking about ‘defeating’ them, and not killing. If he could defeat them and take away the blue-eyes wyrm, there’d be no point in doing anything else. What group would so readily admit that they lost like that?</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal pulsated once with red light as the fireseed in it flew out from it and into his chest.</p>
 <p>‘Coil’ form, activate!</p>
 <p>The Tempest Sword returned to his ring so Bai Yunfei could stand comfortably on the ground and feel as the power of a late-stage Soul Exalt coursed through his body. Stepping forward once, he took off into a sprint towards Wu Han!</p>
 <p>Needless to say, Wu Han was shocked. He took the brat in front of him to only be a mid-stage Soul Exalt, and yet, the brat was now boasting the strength of a late-stage Soul Exalt! How was that even possible!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s increase in strength wasn’t the only factor of surprise, his increase in speed caught Wu Han off guard as well! Left with barely any time to react, Wu Han watched as Bai Yunfei reappeared in front of him with his right arm ready to punch!</p>
 <p>He blinked, refocusing on the situation at hand. He was a late-stage Soul Exalt, how could he be so easily defeated like so? Twisting his body with his soulforce, Wu Han moved so that the Eighty-one Fold Fist Force traveled right underneath his left armpit!</p>
 <p>Wu Han pressed his arm to his side, clenching Bai Yunfei’s right arm to him while bringing the Arctic Pricker in his hand to stab Bai Yunfei through the forehead!</p>
 <p>Unflinchingly, Bai Yunfei had the Cataclysmic Seal come forward to block the weapon and prevent Wu Han’s arm from going forward.</p>
 <p>Wu Han’s eyes narrowed dangerously. The left arm that was holding onto Bai Yunfei’s arm tightly started to shake before his palm started to gather not elemental ice, but a black mist in it!</p>
 <p>His left arm relaxed then as the palm moved forward to grab onto Bai Yunfei’s waist.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang!”</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal and Arctic Pricker collided with one another, blowing his arm back and then him with it. But before he flew too far away, Wu Han’s left palm slammed into Bai Yunfei’s waist and send him flying back as well.</p>
 <p>His eye lit up with glee when he saw his palm connect. With a sneer, he pushed off against the sky and dived straight for Bai Yunfei again!</p>
 <p>A strange expression was on Bai Yunfei’s face. The palm strike hadn’t been too powerful, but there was clearly something else at work, as Bai Yunfei’s face was now slightly white with astonishment. For that one moment, Bai Yunfei felt like he had lost control of his body!</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of that loss in control, Wu Han drew forward to stab Bai Yunfei through the forehead with his Arctic Pricker!</p>
 <p>It was only when the item was practically centimeters away from his forehead did Bai Yunfei finally regain control and leaned towards the right. In the next second, he kicked off away from Wu Han to try and gain some distance.</p>
 <p>Seeing that his attack failed to land, Wu Han sneered. Rotating the Arctic Pricker in his hand, he angled downwards and stabbed it into Bai Yunfei’s left shoulder!</p>
 <p>It drew blood, but Wu Han wasn’t finished with him just yet. His left palm came out again and slammed itself into Bai Yunfei’s chest!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei ignored the wound on his left shoulder, as he felt the incoming palm strike to be the bigger concern and met the palm with a right punch of his own!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Yunfei was sent flying backwards again, his face even more ashen than before, and his right arm laying uselessly by the side!</p>
 <p>To cover his retreat, Bai Yunfei had the Cataclysmic Seal erect a barrier around him. With the added distance between him and Wu Han, Bai Yunfei now had a little more breathing room.</p>
 <p>What once seemed like an ordinary battle had ended up with him eating up a loss just barely a minute after it started!</p>
 <p>Now that he was at rest, Bai Yunfei regarded Wu Han with a renewed look of surprise, anger, and then….murderous intent!</p>
 <p>Clutching at his right arm with a trembling left hand, Bai Yunfei’s teeth gritted together for a moment before he spat out three words!</p>
 <p>“Soul Refining School!!”</p>
