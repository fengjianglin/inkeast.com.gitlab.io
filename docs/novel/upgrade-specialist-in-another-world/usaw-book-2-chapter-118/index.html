 <p>Chapter 118: Taking Care of the "Small Fry"</p>
 <p><span style>The sudden and unexpected development surprised the group from the Beast Taming School. Some of them were stupefied to see the rapid arrival of both Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The taller Soul Sprite was the first to react. In befuddlement, he did not approach to stop the two; instead, ye shouted, “What are you spacing out for? Stop them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halfway through his speech, Jing Mingfeng’s and Bai Yunfei’s right hands moved quickly, launching objects from them. By the time the man finished speaking, the daggers that had been thrown were already on a direct collision course with the rope he was holding in his right hand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again shocked, he hurriedly moved his hand aside. However, he did not move his hand away fast enough since it was being subjected to a great amount of force. Thus, a bloody gash could be seen forming on his wrist as blood began to flow out from the deep wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s… a soul armament!!” The man cried out in despondency. He had felt extremely confident in the defensive ability of the golden aura around him, but it had been easily cut apart by that weapon. Only a soul armament could accomplish such a feat. Were these people using a soul armament merely as a projectile to throw!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shock on his face had not even left his face when something else caused him to cry out once more, “No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the time he had tried the dodge the dagger and was injured by it, the slackened rope had given just enough leeway for the captured bird to escape. With a mighty flap of its right wing, the bird managed to fly back into the air. With its legs escaping the confinements of the rope, the bird was able to let out a weakened chirp. Then with a bit of soulforce, it flew further away. The speed of the quickshade bird was rather slow because of the injuries it had sustained. On the verge of collapse, it finally managed to regain some energy as it flew several hundred meters into the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the bird flew away, Bai Yunfei and Jing Mingfeng had already approached the other soul cultivators. Jing Mingfeng was positioned in front of two Soul Personage while Bai Yunfei was side by side a Soul Warrior and Soul Personage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the time it took to narrate this sequence of events, they had happened in a relatively short amount of time. Before the weaker ones could even react and turn to two to fight them, Bai Yunfei and and Jing Minfeng were already there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Smallfry shouldn’t be getting in the way!” Jing Mingfeng was exuberantly fast and forced the two Soul Personages back half a step before grabbing them both by their faces. His muscles began to bulge, and with two grunts, he immediately smashed their heads into the ground, knocking them out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yunfei had not been any slower, and threw a dagger from his hand. His feet moved furiously as he charged at a Soul Personage. With a fist to the neck, the Soul Personage let out a mouthful of blood before flying a meter way, coming to a rough stop onto the ground. He did not get back up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Warrior reacted slightly faster than his companion and took a full step back. He lifted his right hand and a black jackal type soulbeast came to his side with its jaws wide open to deliver a fatal blow. With a single fist from Bai Yunfei, it was sent flying back, and with his other fist, Bai Yunfei sent the owner flying sideways as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unclear on whether or not Bai Yunfei had intended to hit them in the direction of Jing Mingfeng or if it was just bad luck on their part, but Jing Mingfeng had not been kind to them. With a single kick at the midriff of the man, Jing Mingfeng sent the man flying back to the ground. The jackal soulbeast remained motionless where it was since it had not received a command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a single instant, four men had been felled. Aside from the two Soul Sprites, there were still two Soul Warriors and a Soul Personage. However, there was still a huge gape in strength. Faced against a Soul Sprite, a Soul Warrior had very few ways to defend themselves. A Soul Personage was practically defenseless. They would be out of the equation in a fair match, let alone an ambush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you two!? To interfere with the matters of the Beast Taming School, do you plan to make an enemy out of our school!?” The taller soul cultivator had finally regained his wits as he uttered very typical questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already staunched the bleeding on his right hand, and had also confirmed, with the other Soul Sprite, that one of invaders was an early-stage Soul Sprite while the other was a middle-grade Soul Sprite. Strength like this was not something they could afford to slight, so they called back their four soulbeasts and glared grimly at the opposing two men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who cares about the Beast Taming School. If you displease me, then you’ll have to right your wrongs with a beating!” Jing Mingfeng snorted before lashing out with blinding speed at the Soul Personage on his left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah, you bark louder than a dog!” The shorter Soul Sprite snorted. With a point of his finger, the gray bird let out a shrill chirp as it flew toward Jing Mingfeng. The black bat followed close behind, but its speed was much slower than the bird’s speed because of its injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The taller Soul Sprite didn’t mince his words either. The other side was clearly an enemy, so words would provide no benefit here. With a wave of his own hand, the golden eagle and the rainbow snake flew toward Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining two Soul Warriors had woken to the situation. They fell back to summon a boar type soulbeast and a jet-black python, the size of an arm, to fight Jing Mingfeng and Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Personage Jing Mingfeng had been fighting had already been knocked to the ground, completely unable to battle anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s still two fish to fry, one for you and one for me!” Jing Mingfeng laughed happily as the light under his feet lit up even brighter. Not even bothering to fight either soulbeast sent at him, he gracefully dodged the jet-black ball of liquid from the bat and the gust of wind from the bird before continuing on. Vaulting over the boar with a gentle pat of the hand, he landed on the other side without a single break in his stride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a sequence of movements as smooth as water thanks to his usage of the wind, Jing Mingfeng’s moved as smoothly as Bai Yunfei when he used the Wave Treading Steps, but on a faster scale. Naturally, this speed had been boosted by the agility boosting equipment he was wearing, so within several seconds, he arrived in front of one of the Soul Warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That man was stunned — his eyes simply couldn’t keep up with Jing Mingfeng’s movements; thus, he was struck by Jian Mingfeng’s fist shortly after he threw his hands up to protect himself. With a bang sound, the man was sent flying with an aching pain running through his arms. He hadn’t been able to even fight back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jing Mingfeng prepared to give chase, his eyes suddenly flew up as he hurriedly flew back. The moment after he had moved, a blade of wind swept past where he had originally been. It left a third-of-a-meter-long gap in the ground. After taking two steps back, Jing Mingfeng immediately threw himself to the side to avoid a glob of black liquid spat straight at his chest. Falling to the ground, a sizzling sound could be heard before the earth dissolved away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*cking hell, how ruthless that is!?” Jing Mingfeng cried out in exaggeration. With sparkling eyes, he stomped on the ground to leap a meter into the air to avoid the boar coming straight at him. When his feet touched the ground again, another two whirlwinds came once more…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jing Mingfeng was making a fuss over the three soulbeasts around him, Bai Yunfei himself was stuck in a siege from every side….</span></p>
