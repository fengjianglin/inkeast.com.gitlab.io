 <p>Chapter 229: Renamed as the Cataclysmic Seal! (Third)</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked over the stats of the brick once more before he muttered to himself,<em>&nbsp;“There’s a normal and special mode to the brick. That must mean the normal mode is the same as the +13 brick from before it became a lifebound armament, just with better chances to activate its effects….But the special mode….I wonder what that’s like….”</em></p>
 <p>He had some experience when it came to the upgraded version of the brick, so he begun with sending some of his soulforce into the brick. With a single thought, he had the brick glow bright with red light in preparation for the experiment. It was as if there was some sort of power threatening to explode out from the brick, and even the space nearby the brick was distorting under the red light. With so much of the elemental fire raring to go, the brick was ablaze with its power.</p>
 <p>Sensing the tremendous power from the brick, Bai Yunfei had the feeling that the brick felt more like his own flesh and bone rather than something inanimate. Closing his eyes, Bai Yunfei began to will the stats to appear once more in his mind.</p>

 <p>Lifting an eyebrow, Bai Yunfei asked himself, <em>“The order of the two modes were swapped so that the stats of whichever mode its in is shown first...so this means that it’s in its special mode right now, right?”</em></p>
 <p>Letting go, Bai Yunfei watched as the brick rose into the air and fly up to his eye level. With a second thought, Bai Yunfei watched as the brick flew around his head.</p>
 <p><em>“Go!”</em></p>
 <p>He pointed a finger towards a giant boulder a few hundred meters away from him, manipulating the brick into following his command like an obedient soldier and go flying towards his target in mind.</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>In an explosion of fire, sand, and stones, the boulder was reduced to powder with the utmost ease!</p>
 <p>Nodding his head in satisfaction as the brick returned to him, Bai Yunfei realized that he didn’t even sense the power of the brick. It had been like a tap at first, but the amount of attack that was revealed after the impact was truly worthy of belonging to a mid-heaven tier soul armament.</p>
 <p>Author Note: Please note that the brick is still considered a mid-earth tier armament. But with its additional attack, it can be considered as strong as a mid-heaven tier soul armament. That’s why Kou Changkong thought it to be a mid-heaven tier soul armament and that’s why it said in the stats that the brick was a mid-earth armament. There is no mistake here.</p>
 <p>The most important thing was still the results of the experiment still. The ‘Fire Twister’ hadn’t been tested yet, but that could be done later. For now, Bai Yunfei would try the +12 effect first, the ‘Earthen Barrier’.</p>
 <p>“Bzzzz…”</p>
 <p>The very first unexpected happening occurred then.</p>
 <p>The brick started to vibrate from where it was in the air, but even though he wasn’t touching the brick, Bai Yunfei could feel a large amount of his soulforce suddenly disappear from his body and into the center of his brick. An orange light began to spread out from the brick before immediately coming over to form a protective covering his own entire person.</p>
 <p>“I see now…” Bai Yunfei hummed as he felt the power of the elemental earth flow out from the brick.<em>&nbsp;“I can’t tell how strong the barrier is, but the effect can be clearly seen. It says it can protect me from attacks that are weaker than the attack of my lifebound armament, so the defenses of the barrier is the same as the attack of the brick….”</em></p>
 <p>Exerting himself even more now, Bai Yunfei urged for even more soulforce to go straight into the brick.</p>
 <p>The more soulforce he exported, the more the barrier spread out. Soon, the barrier reached a diameter of twenty meters before coming to a stop. And with some time, the barrier started to shrink back down.</p>
 <p>But as it shrunk, the elemental earth started to grow more concentrated in hue. By the time it was three meters wide in diameter, the orange light was already so thick that it wasn’t even possible to see through it anymore. But Bai Yunfei was still heavily concentrating on the brick in front of him with his soulforce continuing to flow into it.</p>
 <p>As the orange light grew more and more condensed, the light looked as if it was becoming more solid than ethereal. By this point, Bai Yunfei’s forehead was slick with sweat and his breathing was in erratic bursts. He was reaching his limit.</p>
 <p>“Whew…”</p>
 <p>After ten more seconds, Bai Yunfei finally let out a sigh in relief as he cut off the transmission of soulforce. Like shattered glass, the barrier was dispelled into several pieces before ultimately fading away from sight. Any remaining orange light was then sucked back into the brick.</p>
 <p>When the elemental earth was sucked back into the brick, Bai Yunfei was pleasantly surprised to feel that his soulforce was being recuperated at tremendously fast speeds!</p>
 <p>Pleased, Bai Yunfei sat down on the ground and started to focus on recovering his soulforce. The brick floated above his head with the occasional red and orange light basking him in its glow.</p>
 <p>Roughly ten minutes later, Bai Yunfei re-opened his eyes. There was not a bit of fatigue to them now.</p>
 <p>Looking at the brick, Bai Yunfei sighed, <em>“This isn’t enough….I already put in as much soulforce as I could into it, but the defenses were still increasing. This means that I don’t have enough soulforce to bring the barrier to its maximum potential….</em></p>
 <p><em>“Well, I’ve more or less understood the barrier. It’s time for...the last experiment!”</em></p>
 <p><br></p>

 <p>“<em>The description is pretty simple; it’s basically ‘gigantification’. Ten thousand times its size though….that means the brick would be at least a thousand meters in length!”</em> Bai Yunfei calculated in his head.<em>&nbsp;“But it’s pretty clear I won’t be able to do that….let’s try it out first!”</em></p>
 <p>Bringing the brick in front of him, Bai Yunfei looked at it with narrowed eyes and thought, <em>“Grow!”</em></p>
 <p>At his mental command, the brick lit up in a brilliant ray of orange before expanding in size with lightning quick speed!</p>
 <p>In practically no time at all, the brick had already grown larger than a meter in length and nearly a meter in height….perhaps it’d be better call this brick a ‘slab’ instead….</p>
 <p>But already he could feel his soulforce dwindling away in his body.</p>
 <p>Waving his right hand, the brick shot out to fly over the lake before coming to a stop at the center. From there, the brick lit up again and began to grow larger.</p>
 <p>Ten meters. Twenty meters. Fifty meter. A hundred meters. Two hundred meters….</p>
 <p>By the time Bai Yunfei’s breathing was erratic again, the brick was nearing five hundred meters in length, a hundred meters in width, and forty to fifty meters in height. It was a behemoth that floated over the lake surface and seemed to almost cover the entire world with its orange light….</p>
 <p>Narrowing his eyes, Bai Yunfei swung his arm up to point a finger at a small mountain point a few thousand meters away.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh….”</p>
 <p>Now several hundred times larger than before, the brick bolted towards where Bai Yunfei pointed with the speed of a raging gale. And in a few scant seconds, it was just about to break into the mountain.</p>
 <p>A small gleam of light streaked across Bai Yunfei’s eyes, “Drop!”</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>At the very same time the word ‘drop’ came out from his mouth, the brick immediately dropped down from the skies!</p>
 <p>There was an explosion as the surrounding thousand meters was disrupted by the ensuing earthquake. When he looked back up, the brick had disappeared into the mountain!</p>
 <p>Narrowing his eyes again, Bai Yunfei spoke up, “Rise!”</p>
 <p>Another explosion could be heard along with several trees flying up into the air along with something. It was the gigantic brick.</p>
 <p>As it flew higher into the skies, the brick began its short retreat back to Bai Yunfei. At the same time, the brick was decreasing in size as it traveled so that it was back to its normal size.</p>
 <p>With his soulforce back, Bai Yunfei began to sigh in relief. Standing up, Bai Yunfei jumped up to a nearby tree to get the higher ground.</p>
 <p>Looking a thousand meters ahead of him where the brick had impacted, Bai Yunfei could see that there was a clear crater left there! He couldn’t even see how deep the crater was from where he was!</p>
 <p>He continued to stare at the crater for about a minute longer before Bai Yunfei decided to call it quits. Sitting down on the coarse tree branch, Bai Yunfei looked at the ordinary-looking brick in his hands with a strange look.</p>
 <p>“Now <em>this</em> is <em>not</em> a brick….In its normal mode, the +13 effect can send people flying. In its special mode, the +13 effect….can kill a person. With strength like that, anyone could have the brick come slamming down on even the Blackwood Stronghold and eliminate it from existence…..”</p>
 <p>“It’s a good thing that this has the strength of a mid-heaven tier soul armament as my lifebound armament. I shouldn’t even call this a brick…..” Bai Yunfei chuckled to himself.</p>
 <p>And then an idea hit him.</p>
 <p>“From today onwards, your name shall be the Cataclysmic Seal!!”</p>
