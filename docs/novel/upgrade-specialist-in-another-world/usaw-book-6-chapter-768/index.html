 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Killing the second beast tamer hadn’t been a snap of the fingers for Bai Yunfei, he had to give up half his soulforce in order to have a guaranteed kill onto him. Using the +13 additional effect of the Fire-tipped Spear was a bit of an overkill, but it got the job done, and Bai Yunfei had no qualms about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next thing Bai Yunfei did was to reclaim his Fire-tipped Spear and store it back into his space ring. The space rings of the beast tamers, on the other hand, were looted by him shortly afterwards. One fireball later, the two corpses were completely disintegrated and the evidence of their being here wiped from the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei also helped himself to the soulbeast puppets of the beast tamers. Now that he knew it was possible to fly on soulbeasts, Bai Yunfei wasn’t very inclined to use his feet to run. He called out an early-stage class six thundertail bird and used the Beast Taming Ring to fly away from the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d have to stay away from the soulbeast puppets of the beast tamers he killed here for the time being. The whitegale eagle for example was far too conspicuous with most of the beast tamers knowing who it belonged to. The early-stage class six thundertail bird he was using was the soulbeast puppet of a beast tamer he killed long ago, and was a fairly common type of soulbeast. No one would take much consideration into a soulbeast like that beyond thinking it was his soulbeast partner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his senses, Bai Yunfei could feel the auras of several people within his range of detection. They were clearly here because they felt the disturbance in the air and came to observe, but only just observe when they saw it was Bai Yunfei that was one of the fighters. None of them saw who it was he was fighting, and some of them left shortly afterwards to avoid being caught up with any trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll meet up with senior You first before looking for Yue Feng. I wonder if he managed to save his friend…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Bai Yunfei thought to himself as he flew through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flying through the air was a great deal better than walking, and Bai Yunfei was able to see far more than he would’ve on the ground. His eyes took in the sights here and there, then something bright caught his eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That mountain over there!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain he had been fighting the two beast tamers on was at most a hundred meters tall, a height which was a great deal shorter than the surrounding ones. For that reason, Bai Yunfei wasn’t able to see much when he was fighting, but now that he was up above it, Bai Yunfei could see off in a distance a mountain peak that was shining slightly red in color!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still a great ways away from where Bai Yunfei was, but he recognized it! This was the same mountain peak the mirage outside the pocket showed to have the Extreme King Pills!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I found it! It’s over there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei shouted out in joy to his mind. He wasn’t too blinded by his excitement to rush straight for the Extreme King Pills first, he still had to go the other way and group up with the others. You Qingfeng and his friend were both in a very weak state due to their battle, and Bai Yunfei didn’t want to leave them unprotected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also didn’t really know what was going on with Yue Feng, and even though he didn’t know him as much, the man was a student of someone he knew and respected. To journey with him would make their life safer, so it was worth the attempt. Now that he could use a soulbeast to fly, Bai Yunfei wouldn’t need to waste any time or energy to fly then to where the Extreme King Pills were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thundertail bird’s flight was considerably fast and took only a few minutes before Bai Yunfei was nearly back to where he had left You Qingfeng and his friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? That’s…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was making sure he was traveling in the right direction when something in the corners of his eyes caught his attention. Focusing a little more on this sight, he exhaled slightly from curiosity and had the thundertail bird stop for a second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just about two hundred meters to the right was a mountain peak about three hundred meters tall. He leered at the top of the peak for a second, unsure if what he was seeing was real or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That….looks like….” Bai Yunfei muttered to himself. Wracking his brains for what it was exactly, it took him a good few seconds before he had his answer. “Are those boltgrass?! It is! They are!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boltgrass is a type of plant that is entirely violet in color and had forked leaves so that it looked like several bolts of lightning were running through them. While rare, the grass themselves aren’t worth much in value. Their true worth is in what grew nearby…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vein of boltstones!!</span></p>

It was practically an essential material for when crafting a heaven-tier soul armament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Crafting School hadn’t any boltstones! It was only because of an ancient record of materials Bai Yunfei once read that he even recognized what they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A vein of boltstones! There’s a vein here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s eyes shined with excitement. For a crafter like him, a rare material that could be used to craft soul armaments was something to salivate over. Directing the bird towards that direction, Bai Yunfei made a hasty approach to where the boltgrass were growing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He reached the cliffside in a few seconds, but he was stunned to realize….</span></p>

Bai Yunfei whipped his head into the direction of the source—it was coming from where he left You Qingfeng!</span></p>

The airwaves resonated with something else in the area and quickly revealed the rest of the ‘cliffside’ here, revealing all sorts of grass planted on the ground, each of them violet in color and shaped just like miniature lightning bolts….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the sight was only for a moment before it disappeared….</span></p>

A crater several hundred meters deep had formed in the plains with three different figures of light shining. Of the three, two figures were cloaked in red and the third was in green. They were fighting.</span></p>
