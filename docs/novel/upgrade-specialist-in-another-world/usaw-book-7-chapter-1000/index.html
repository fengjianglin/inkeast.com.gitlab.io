 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the Soul Refining School. On top of a large mountain with black clouds swirling around its top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single stone room several meters large in area was constructed at the mountain-top. There were no decorations in this room, but a single person sat inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person wore robes that were a grayish-black, but not something that was ultimately unordinary. The owner, a man who looked like he was in his forties, had sideburns that were shaved to have an edge as sharp as a blade and eyebrows equally sharp. His facial appearance was staunch, and his calm seated posture gave one the feeling as if he was seated in the center of the world. The only way someone could tell that he was alive was from how he breathed in like he was trying to take in all the air in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At some point during one of his breathing cycles, his eyebrows suddenly shot up on his forehead. As if he was twitching, a strange expression took place on his face. Outside the mountain, the black mist around it started to flow erratically!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expression on this man’s face only deepened as time went on. He looked like he was in pain. Soon, the twitches that had been apparent on his face had disseminated to the rest of his body before a wave of energy exploded out from his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahhh!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A scream followed suit. Eyes flying wide open at last, the man’s bright eyes could finally be seen. This man was…furious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wave of energy quaked the earth and cause parts of the mountain to fall apart like when a volcano erupted. A cloud of dust and stone was kicked up high into the air as the mountain began to crumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black beam shot up from the ruined mountain up into the sky like a shooting star to fly further and further away and out of sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The total destruction of the mountain led to all those who were in the vicinity of it to immediately make their way over. Three figures shot up into the air to stand on the same level as where the mountain-top and stared on in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?! What’s going on?! Where…why has the headmaster stopped his training?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He can’t have! The ‘Thousand Day Refinement’ requires exactly a thousand days of training! There was only just a few dozen weeks left, why…why would the headmaster give up after nine hundred days?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no way! The headmaster was nearly at the end of a thousand days! Three years of work! Why would the headmaster do such a thing?! What in the world has happened?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has to be something of the utmost importance! Didn’t the headmaster’s avatar go with the first elder to chase down the intruder? Does…does it have to do with that?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could…could it?! That person was only a Soul King! Even if he has the power to fight against a Half-emperor, that shouldn’t mean he’d be able to win against the headmaster’s avatar? Why would the headmaster go in the flesh?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whatever the reason, it surely can’t be for a minor reason! We’ll need to ask the headmaster when he gets back…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the area where Bai Yunfei fought Nether’s avatar. The battlefield still had clear skies with the fog not yet settling back in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the edge of where the fog was stood two figures. They were standing deep within the fog so that they couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the two wore a dark-purple robe and had a gold mask on his face. It was Yao Tong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A malnourished elder stood next to him. His white robes were in just as much of a mess as his hair. Matted and sprawled over the back of his neck, this elder looked like he had been stuck in quite a mess for some time. But even despite that, this elder had a powerful air to him that seemed to force even the fog away from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two were standing there with wide-open eyes at what they had just witnessed over the last few minutes. Shock&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">and</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;joy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Destroyed?! Nether’s avatar was destroyed?! Haha!! A beautiful sight! Beautiful! How pleasing!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder roared with laughter in a way that seemed like he was not all there in the head. As if laughing with him, the fog swirled around angrily under the influence of the energy he carried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yao Tong glanced around the place in curiosity. “Master…if the first elder is right there, should we take this chance to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one he called ‘master’ stopped laughing to give the faraway Qin Bangjie a brief look. “No. We should take this chance to run away, in fact. We might otherwise be too late if we don’t…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Yao Tong wasn’t quite sure what his master was getting at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Asura of the Nether just had his avatar vanquished. What do you think he’d do next?” The elder gave Yao Tong a hard look. “He’ll be here in a moment, and we’d be best not to be when he arrives. Let us be off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one visible pupil in Yao Tong’s eyes dilated at the realization of that. He nodded his head and followed his master deeper into the mist…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe…you said that person just now was Bai Yunfei of the Crafting School? What a marvelous youngster! What a shame he is dead…his tale simply cannot be laid to rest here. We should help him spread the news! Haha!!! The Soul Refining School suffered major losses by the hand of a single ‘youth’! How hilarious! How utterly refreshing, hahaha!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the laughter of the elderly man could be heard as the two walked deeper and deeper into the mist…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bzzz….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something began to buzz in the area, alerting Qin Bangjie to the presence of someone teleporting in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the figure in gray step out from a distortion in space, Qin Bangjie began to tremble. “Hea—headmaster!!” He greeted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nether glanced at Qin Bangjie. Seeing nothing in his hands, the man’s eyes snapped up to give Qin Bangjie a heavy glare. “Where is he?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was here for Bai Yunfei’s corpse. Surely, Bai Yunfei had to have died and Qin Bangjie picked it up. But…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Headmaster…” Qin Bangjie mumbled, unsure of what to say or do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is Bai Yunfei?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nether blew up with anger. He was done with beating around the bush.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He…he fell into a spatial crack!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you just say?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If glares could start fires, then Qin Bangjie would’ve been ashes by now. A wave of soulforce exploded from Nether in his fit of anger, distorting the space around him and leaving behind a path of destruction in its wake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nether used his very own avatar in order to use the secret technique, Samsara, so that Bai Yunfei could be killed and his corpse taken. It should’ve been a simple task to take the Soul Sealing Mandate, Core Stone, and the many other soul armaments he had in his space rings. Then another technique would’ve been used to salvage the ‘memories’ gotten from Samsara and obtain all that he wanted to know. In that regard, the Soul Refining School would at least gain&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">something</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;from this disaster and begin to recover from their losses…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after breaking out from his nine hundred days of training—and essentially throwing away three years of work—Bai Yunfei was lost in a spatial crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All that effort wasted and Nether had nothing to show for it! Not even a single thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pcht!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood within Qin Bangjie’s body began to boil from the amount of soulforce Nether was giving out and quickly escaped out from his mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A furious roar exploded forth from Nether to resonate throughout the entire Lost Swamp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Far far away from the Lost Swamp. In a certain area of the Swallow Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several streaks of light were flying through the air. In one of these streaks was Tang Xinyun. She was flying on top of a flying sword while Long Lan flew besides her. Her quickshade bird was perched on top of her shoulder while Xiao Qi was perched on top of Long Lan’s. Even the permafrost mastiff was out and flying about with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their departure from Swallow City had not been impeded. Not even Yan Tianxing stood up to stop them. None of them were willing to stop in any case so they could return back to Mo City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah! Noo!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were flying, Xiao Qi suddenly let out a squawk of panic, drawing the attention of Tang Xinyun and his other companions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong, Xiao Qi?!” She asked in nervous concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…” Xiao Qi was looking even more panicked than she was. “I can’t sense him! I…I don’t have any way of knowing where Bai Yunfei is!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” All semblance of color drained away from Tang Xinyun’s face. “But how can that be?! It can’t be because he’s too far away, can it? How can he simply just…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know, I don’t know! He just suddenly disappeared! Yunfei should be fine, shouldn’t he? He&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">has&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">to be alright!” Tears were already beginning to form in Xiao Qi’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something popped in Tang Xinyun’s knuckles, her hands had been gripped so tightly that her nails were already close to drawing blood. “He’s fine! He’s definitely fine! We have to go back! The Crafting School has Yunfei’s life slip! We might be able to find where he is! We have to go!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And just like that, the group exploded with even greater speed than before to return to the Crafting School!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">————————</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half a month later, news of what happened in Swallow City as quickly spreading throughout the entire continent and world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strongest family of soul cultivators within the Swallow Province, the Qin….was gone from the world of soul cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patriarch Qin had failed to become a Soul Emperor and fought with Jing ‘Reaper’ Wuying. In the end, patriarch Qin used the Soul Sealing Mandate to defeat Jing Wuying and was instead killed in turn! Then the twenty Soul Kings of the Qin were subsequently killed! And the current head of the Qin, Qin Long, was nowhere to be seen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason behind the downfall of the Qin was said to be the patriarch of the number one clan of assassins in the older days, Jing Wuying and another youth! And aside from them two, there was another main culprit, Bai Yunfei of the Crafting School!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only had he managed to kill multiple Soul Kings, Bai Yunfei was also rumored to have killed the Half-emperor patriarch Qin himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No sooner did news of the battle outside Swallow City began to circulate did the events outside Mo City start to circulate as well. Outside that city, Bai Yunfei had also been a part of a battle that saw to him killing even more Soul Kings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a shocking piece of information. The name ‘Bai Yunfei’ was already something many people were paying close attention to. At first, everyone only saw him as a prestigious figure of the ‘next generation’, meaning that while strong, he wasn’t quite there yet with being a part of the strongest. But now. He was a man capable of killing Soul Kings and even a Half-emperor! He was a man now capable of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the strongest of the previous generations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing that confused people was that Bai Yunfei had simply disappeared after his battle in Swallow City. Along with another mysterious person, Bai Yunfei had simply vanished into thin air and was nowhere to be seen after the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take much to notice that one of the Five Families, the Tang, was beginning to move. Their entire family was apparently in search of Bai Yunfei, and they weren’t the only ones. The house of Zheng in the Capital was embarking on the same quest to find Bai Yunfei.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Crafting School, the school everyone had long since thought to be content in ‘seclusion’ was starting to mobilize their entire school to find Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s when everyone realized what was going on. Bai Yunfei had gone missing after his battle outside Swallow City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul cultivators all over the continent began to buzz with activity. Each piece of information they were getting was getting more and more incredulous…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumors had it that the one who ‘ambushed’ Bai Yunfei was the junior headmaster of the Soul Refining School. When the two fought one another, the junior headmaster used a transporting soul armament to bring both him and Bai Yunfei to the Soul Refining School!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumors also had it that Bai Yunfei unloaded a great disaster onto the entire Soul Refining School. It was said he killed many students, over a dozen Soul Kings, and even a Half-emperor! And…it was said even the Soul Emperor ‘Asura of the Nether’ had his avatar vanquished in his battle with Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those rumors were far too much to believe. Not many people even believed those rumors to be remotely true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But several soul cultivators who had long since been thought to be dead began to reappear on the continent. They all claimed to have been held captive by the Soul Refining School if they didn’t swear allegiance to them. The soul cultivators said they were able to escape from the Soul Refining School after Bai Yunfei created the opportunity, and according to them…the rumors&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">were</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, in fact, true!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wouldn’t have been much to change the minds of the crowd if it was said by any unordinary person, but each of these persons was all very powerful Soul Kings. Their words held more weight in them than most, and so many people began to have second thoughts on whether or not what they heard was true…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With time, the entire world of soul cultivators began to realize something else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul Refining School used to have many of its members making moves in the continent before. But now, not a single member could be seen or even heard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more people began to collaborate on this. If the Soul Refining School were suddenly inactive when they used to not be, then…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rumors had to be true! And by extension…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">had</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;to have done it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While suddenly the talk of the empire, Bai Yunfei wasn’t the only topic that was talked about. There were a few other things that people were talking about that were astoundingly amazing to hear, but they were overshadowed by Bai Yunfei’s achievements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, it was made known that the ‘vanquished’ house of Qin was in cahoots with the Soul Refining School. The mines in their control had signs of an ancient matrix constructed in it where the Qin wantonly sacrificed hundreds of ordinary soul cultivators to progress their own selfish goals. It was even confirmed when the Tianhun School captured any surviving member and the school declared Qin Long to be a wanted criminal by the entire empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, the Tianhun School employed multiple members to go out seeking any Qin member that might’ve escaped. Each one of them met a ‘mysterious death’, however, as if they were being hunted and killed. At one point, the Tianhun School had an Early-stage Soul King in charge of protecting the ones they captured, only to have someone kill those members regardless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another astonishing piece of information was the fact that the whereabouts of the Soul Refining School was finally made known. It was said that the Soul Refining School was located within the Lost Swamps. As such, many groups began to employ their strongest to make forays into that swamp, but because of how dangerous and strange the swamp was, none of the people they sent in were able to find anything of value. Some of them didn’t even manage to come back…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another dozen days went by before the next bombshell dropped upon the continent. This time, the entire continent felt like it seemed a giant storm was coming, and the entire continent was to be the stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Crafting School was beginning to offer rewards for information!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a person were to have a clue about the Soul Refining School or their whereabouts and have it be verified, that person would be given a low-heaven tier soul armament! And if a person had details on Bai Yunfei’s whereabouts, a mid-heaven tier soul armament! And if they actively assist in the search for Bai Yunfei, a high-heaven tier soul armament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rewards of such things got the blood of every soul cultivator going. Everyone knew that the Crafting School—who had been quiet for the past two dozen years or so—was finally breaking their seclusion! They were waking up with a vengeance against the Soul Refining School!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, the Crafting School was the first to strike whenever news of the Soul Refining School came out. Not even the Tianhun School were able to react as fast as the Crafting School were before a stronghold of the Soul Refining School was wiped out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to eye-witnesses, they said that the Crafting School had the advantage in terms of power. With all their powerful soul armaments at each of their crafter’s disposal, there was no way their enemies could even hope to resist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most terrifying thing was Bai Yunfei’s soulbeast partner. It was said that the bird stormed into an enemy formation by itself and managed to destroy the two mountains the enemies were using as a base. Then after interrogating anyone that was alive about Bai Yunfei’s whereabouts, the bird would slaughter them all! Not even the Soul King hiding with them was spared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one particular school that was found out to have connections with the Soul Refining School. That school had almost ten Soul Kings within their ranks; not a small amount of firepower by any means.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And yet, the first elder led the charge into that school and managed to kill them all! The ‘supporting’ members of the Tianhun School hadn’t even had enough time to join the fray before they were left with ‘clean-up’ duty…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from Xiao Qi and Long Lan, the Crafting School had six Soul Kings take part in that battle! Not only were Xiao Binzi and Huangfu Nan there, four other Soul Kings from that had gone into seclusion took part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the proof many people needed. The Crafting School didn’t ‘decline’ at all in the past twenty years, they were still as powerful as ever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The drums of war were starting to grow louder, and the soul cultivators in the continent were excited to see the next battle take place. Many of them were already suggesting that not a single part of the continent wouldn’t see this war take place and that the evil Soul Refining School would soon be exterminated at last.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things weren’t as easy as many expected. News of the Soul Refining School started to peter out, and no one else was coming forward with any relevant information about them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a way, it had to be expected. The Soul Refining School stood for thousands of years. A few battles here and there wouldn’t be enough to root them out from the continent. They were still holed up in their base in the Lost Swamp, to which no one had found yet…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei hadn’t shown up to anyone’s knowledge either. Many people were already thinking that it was true he had died in his battle with the headmaster of the Soul Refining School. Bai Yunfei was dead…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Swallow City, the manor of the lord-mayor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door to a particularly dark room was pushed open. A small candle was lit inside the room to reveal a stern-faced Yan Tianxing striding inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it? Has the first prince left yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gravelly voice spoke to Yan Tianxing the moment he strode in. The candle flickered as it was jostled to the side to shed light onto a seated person in the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person wore black robes and had hair that was a grizzly gray color. The man looked especially haggard. This person was…the missing ‘criminal’ and head of the Qin, Qin Long!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was actually hiding within the lord-mayor’s manor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Tianxing nodded. “He has left Swallow City. I believe that…he is already starting to suspect me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?! You’ve been found out?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Tianxing shook his head. “He is suspicious, but nothing more. He will most likely send more people to keep an eye on me in the future, I cannot afford to do anything that might deepen his suspicions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Therefore,” He paused to take a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will need to leave now. Someone will bring you to the Soul Refining School. You…you should reside in there as a visiting elder…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Long said nothing. The muscles on his face twitched as he considered the reality of his situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me…has that Bai Yunfei really died? Are the rumors true?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Tianxing nodded. “He fell into a spatial crack…do you think anyone could survive in there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pleased smile ran across Qin Long’s face, but that moment passed quickly. “But…the Jing still live on, do they not?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It matters little if they do. You shouldn’t focus on revenge in the state you’re in.” Yan Tianxing rebuked, “The Soul Refining School has what you want. Seclude yourself and train. Perhaps you’ll become a Soul Emperor…then you can take revenge on the Jing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That got Qin Long’s attention. “Very well! I will go to the Soul Refining School!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Soul Refining School.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of a small mountain stood a melancholic young man. He surveyed the landscape around him. Though prideful, the face of this person had also a streak of desolation on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Mo Ni.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flash of light crossed the corners of his eyes. “You’re finally back, Black Dragon…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At some point while he was surveying the lands, a figure in black teleported behind him. It was the Black Dragon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Dragon King gave Mo Ni a scrutinizing look. “I heard a few rumors while outside…are they true?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rumors? Rumors that Bai Yunfei killed many of our numbers? Or rumors that my father’s avatar took Bai Yunfei down with him?” Mo Ni jeered, “If those are the rumors you mean, then yes, they are true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An eyebrow rose up on the Black Dragon King’s face. He had to admit, he was surprised. “Then…Bai Yunfei is truly dead?” He pressed on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is.” Mo Ni laughed. “He’s dead, but…not before leaving us with a humiliating slap in the face…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shook his head as if to rid himself of those thoughts. Sucking in a deep breath, he turned to head back down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go find a place…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To train.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Road to the Nether!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Crafting School. Also on top of a mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A graceful figure in white floated through the skies. A thousand strands of black hair floated gently in the wind as this person drifted down to the mountain. This person was refined and graceful in motion but looked quite melancholic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Xinyun looked off into the distance in sadness. In her hand was a small life slip that occasionally pulsated with a soft light. Her fingers closed over it in concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t be dead, Yunfei…I know you won’t die…you said you’d be back. I know you will…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She muttered to herself. Forcing the tears away from her eyes, she looked back up to the skies with a determined light in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We won’t give up. No matter where you are, we’ll find you…even if you’re at the opposite end of the world!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She took off into the sky once again. Flying into the horizon, Tang Xinyun quickly disappeared into the horizon…&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Author Notes:</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Book Seven has finally concluded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, I am rather pleased with how this book turned out. Compared to the previous two, I feel this one has been rather true to what I originally planned to write.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few conspiracies have finally been revealed and Bai Yunfei has grown stronger again. And yet rather than having more answers than secrets, the secrets have gotten more complex. As he is today, Bai Yunfei is now and truly entering the stage where the strong play. It won’t be too long before the true storm is unleashed onto the stage, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Our book has finally reached the mid-way point of the final phase, but because of the plot and finer details, this author cannot even begin to tell any one of you readers how many chapters or characters are left to write. Time will tell, but I will be sure to write to the best of my ability so that you may all enjoy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thousand chapters. Not one chapter less, not one chapter more. A thousand chapters! 2.6 million characters written! I never thought that I’d write this much when I first started out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that isn’t a good thing, I suppose. This&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">is</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;my first book, after all, and I’ve drawn out several things for far too long. It gets harder and harder to write in these cases, but fortunately this is an issue that popped up rather late. But now, I wouldn’t be able to write up the ending to this story quickly even if I wanted to. All that’s left to do is to slowly work at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now we begin the more ‘common’ problem: Income.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve written 2.6 million characters by this point. Generally, writing 1 million would mean getting a relatively high authors remuneration, but in truth, this author has been feeling rather ‘out of sorts’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several authors who started their works at the same time as I have have already started a new work, and their income is much higher than mine…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is a very ‘real’ problem, and this author cannot say I don’t ‘care’ about money. Who doesn’t care about money? Who doesn’t want to have proof of their own ‘worth’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I actually submitted a request for a raise when my novel reached the two million character mark. As some readers might know, that was around the time I began to have a few difficulties in real life. My publishing schedule became irregular and my subscriptions took a nosedive. My performance became an immediate wreck, and a result my request was denied…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six hundred thousand characters have passed since then, and my performance is finally picking back up to levels I’m happy to see. Soon, I’ll make another request for a raise, and hopefully that’ll succeed this time…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it does, then I’ll be happy to say that my income will have increased and I can be proud of myself when I have proof for my parents that the ‘path’ I chose was worth it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I wish to become a novelist. Writing novels is what I love to do the most…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My dreams have conflicted with my parents many times before, and I’ve always felt like I’ve been under pressure to show ‘proof’ that I can succeed in this path that I have chosen. I will try my best to improve my performance. I will do what I can, and I hope my readers will enjoy my work…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to have the website be willing to give a raise, one must have the appropriate performance for it. In this case, performance can be measured in the amount of times a novel has been bookmarked and licked. Red packets are secondary in this measure, the most important statistic for websites to make a judgment is to see the amount of ‘subscriptions’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subscriptions are what novelists need most from their readers for validation. It’s the backbone of how novels are ‘judged’ by the website.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in truth, the subscriptions of USAW has been almost unbearable to look at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twenty-six thousand readers have bookmarked USAW, but the subscription rate of it would probably lose out to novels that might have only ten thousand bookmarks…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And so I have to admit that I feel unbelievably frustrated. Is my work truly ‘not worth’ it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve increased my rate of release as of late and the subscription rates have increased as a result, so that gives me some hope. I am sure that if I keep working hard, then I will obtain the approval of even more readers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If you enjoy my novel, then I hope you will support me and subscribe. It’s not much for a thousand words, and hardly even ten dollars for a month. But for me, that little money is worth quite a lot…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was meant to be words of appreciation for reaching a thousand chapters has suddenly turned into me shamelessly begging for subscriptions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I am sorry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While it might be in poor taste for me to write such a message, it is truly what I have been feeling in my heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I have put in my all for this story, and I hope that I can achieve results that reflect as such. I hope that everyone will support me and allow my novel to reach a glory equivalent to the work I put in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Well, I’ll be quiet now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thank you to everyone that has supported me. I hope I will see you all walk this path with me in the future. I hope that my future stories will be to everyone’s satisfaction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And last but not least, I want to say it once again: Thank you everyone for your support!</span></p>
