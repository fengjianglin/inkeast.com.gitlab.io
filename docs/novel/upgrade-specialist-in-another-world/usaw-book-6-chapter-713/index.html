 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

It chimed through the air clearly and without a direction. Then right besides the bloody-robed man, a space in the area warped in on itself to allow for a person draped in black mist to come walking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Teleportation!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heart skipping a beat, Bai Yunfei flew back away from the two. In order to cover for his retreat, Bai Yunfei was about to have Xiao Qi send out a Spatial Edge at the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But rather than help the other person, the newcomer raised his hand to grab at the bloody-robed person. &nbsp;Was he stopping them for Bai Yunfei?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he not an enemy then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was suspicious now. This man did call out the name of the person he had just been fighting, so it was obvious they were companions or something. Him stopping the other was definitely not a gesture of goodwill towards Bai Yunfei, there had to be another reason for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!!”</span></p>

Aura not even weakening in the slightest, the bloody-robed person continued to stalk towards Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!!”</span></p>

Raising his right hand and stabbing a finger into the other person's flesh, the Soul King had the black aura around the bloody-robed person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Refrain from using that move or you'll die! Your death is inexcusable to the young master, so stand down at once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last few words of his command was accentuated with a burst of power only a mid-stage Soul King was capable of. In response to that outburst, the furious aura of the newly-advanced early-stage Soul King started to calm down. Even though it didn't seem like the person had heard the other Soul King, they were definitely looking a lot more restrictive in their movement. The indomitable aura that seemed raring to explode at Bai Yunfei was slowly starting to calm a bit, and the guttural growls was starting to grow silent. Even the blood construct was warping in on itself as the blood that made up its body started to fade or return to its master's body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the bloody-robed person crumpled like paper into the arms of the other Soul King. &nbsp;The person was completely unconscious now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their aura was completely deflated now. From where it used to soaring to the skies, the person's aura was now at an all time low. With all the blood flowing out from the multiple wounds on their body, it seemed as if the person was a corpse rather than a deranged Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei watched everything happen in front of him with a dropped jaw. As surprising as it was though, he was finally starting to understand what had happened in the fight. That mysterious technique the bloody-robed person used to devour the blood octopus and increase their strength was powerful beyond belief, but not perfect by any means. An explosive spike in power like that was at the cost of burning away their own lifeforce. If the person had actually used their strongest attack without being stopped, then they would've definitely died, even if the attack landed or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the Soul King came in to stop his comrade before the final attack could be used. It served to help Bai Yunfei escape with his life, but it was an indirect effect of trying to save his comrade's life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with the two powerful foes being dealt with, Bai Yunfei wasn't entirely happy with the situation just yet. In fact, he was still feeling quite sour. &nbsp;Right in front of him was yet another mid-stage Soul King after all......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He has to be someone else from the Soul Refining School. I never thought they'd have a Soul King like this, how troublesome......”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that the bloody-robed person was fully unconscious in and the arms of the other Soul King, the Soul King looked over to where Bai Yunfei was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei felt himself start when their eyes met. Taking one careful step backwards, Bai Yunfei prepared himself to go on the defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Soul King didn't seem on planning to do anything. He just stared. His eyes swept over Bai Yunfei first before to Xiao Qi, and then to the 'remnants' of the blood octopus down below. The black mist around him trembled a bit as if angered by its death, but the Soul King didn't do anything about that either. &nbsp;Looking away with a sigh, the Soul King started to....fly away to the north!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space in front of him warped in on itself when he waved his left hand. Stepping across it with his comrade in his hands, the Soul King disappeared and reappeared a great distance away. And with several repetitions, the two were now gone beyond the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was with silence Bai Yunfei watched the two leave the area, “Are....are they really just going to leave like that?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought he was in for a dreadful battle actually. The fact that the two of them left without fighting was completely unexpected to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still feeling uneasy about the situation, Bai Yunfei looked around the area carefully before he made any sudden movements. He turned back towards the direction where the Soul King came from first. &nbsp;Formagua City. &nbsp;He could sense a few auras coming from that direction; it had to be Zheng Kai and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their imminent arrival gave Bai Yunfei a great deal of relief. Not only did it mean they were safe, it also meant Bai Yunfei was too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of blue light came flying down from the skies before coming to a stop next to Bai Yunfei. &nbsp;It was Long Lan. &nbsp;He swept his eyes around the area to make sure there were no enemies before asking, “Yunfei, Xiao Qi, are you two both alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei's Berserk Mode was canceled out, leaving Bai Yunfei temporarily breathless. He managed to wave his arm at Long Lan. “I'm fine, the enemy's gone now, are you all alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was completely at ease and could smile now. But then when he looked to the group coming towards him, he paused. Several of them looked quite grim, especially Tang Xinyun and Kou Tingting who both looked like they were close to tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A little perplexed by the situation at hand, Bai Yunfei gave an inquisitive look at them. “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He came to a quick realization before any of them could answer, however. &nbsp;“Wait, where's Doraemon?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doraemon was missing! Everyone was here and accounted for in the group except for one little girl....Huangfu Rui!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yunfei....little Rui....little Rui is missing! What do we do...?” Tang Xinyun asked him in panic, her face twisted up and ready to cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“......” Bai Yunfei grew somber at the predicament. Tearing his eyes away from the despondent two girls, he turned to Zheng Kai, “Ah'Zheng, what happened? How'd Doraemon go missing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai was quick to calm down enough to tell the story. “When you disappeared down the hole to give chase, we were about to leave the city when we were ambushed out of nowhere. We were trapped in a strange underground labyrinth after that where we couldn't even use our soulsense. Plenty of tentacles attacked us while we were trying to find our way out, but we managed to gather together eventually. But we....never managed to group back with little Rui in the end.....”</span></p>

At first, the red magiboar was heading in the direction of little Rui, but then he said something was blocking the connection to her and could no longer sense her.....We tried looking around for her but then we sensed someone fighting something. We knew you were in danger so we decided to come to you first, and then the red magiboar....decided to continue to look for little Rui. We....we don't know where either of the two are now....”</span></p>
