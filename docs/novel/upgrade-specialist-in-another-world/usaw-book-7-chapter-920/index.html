 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Striking the earth with a mighty crash, the bolt of lightning illuminated the area for one instantaneous moment before it faded away to leave behind a crater and a storm of dust to cover all. Even Bai Yunfei and Qin Long were obscured by the dust.</span></p>

His eyes twinkled with a mysterious light as if thinking about something at first, but then a surprised expression came across his face as he watched a figure in red fly out from the dust before a figure in green flew out from the other direction.</span></p>

When he saw Bai Yunfei retreat, Yan Tianxing could’ve sworn he saw a flicker of purple lightning come to life within the red flames before disappearing back into it again.</span></p>

He tossed away the fragments a little absent-mindedly and retreated back several hundred steps more. He didn’t make another attack. Either Bai Yunfei’s tactics had frightened him off, or Yan Tianxing’s arrival was a large enough obstruction for him to think otherwise.</span></p>

I might not be as strong as you, but even I can help even the odds for you. But the case is indeed complicated as you say…how’d the two sons die in front of you? There’s no chance of a calm negotiation now…”</span></p>

The lord-mayor only started to head out from the city when he felt Qin Long’s aura blazing outside of it and hurried over. It was only a short while for him to reach this place, but the second son of Qin Long had actually died during that time! It was startling news that also made Yan Tianxing feel regretful. Any chance of an ‘amicable’ talk was no longer possible between Bai Yunfei and Qin Long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But his duties as lord-mayor of Swallow City and Marquis of the Swallow Province prohibited him from allowing Bai Yunfei to die here in the proximity of Swallow City.

He couldn’t exactly say that this was a case of misunderstanding and that they should talk things out over a nice cup of tea! The hate Qin Long had for Bai Yunfei was justifiable and unrelenting. How could he possibly stand to persuaded to ‘negotiate’ with the killer of his sons?</span></p>

I was originally leaving Swallow City to avoid any trouble. It was Qin Shoufeng that chased after me and started to fight. I only wanted to injure him, but he decided to self-destruct before I could take actions to prevent it. Then Qin Shouhao came. He wanted to fight me as well after he saw Qin Shoufeng die but knew he wasn’t strong enough to beat me and left to Swallow City. He came back shortly afterward and self-destructed just as quickly as his younger brother. I believe the two of them were influenced by someone to go crazy. In short…I didn’t do anything to kill anyone. I am confident many of the passersby can bear witness to this. Most of them are still here, in fact, you can ask them. I hope lord Yan will deal out justice in this matter.”</span></p>

He also wanted to make sure he had a way out in the case that people started to think he was the actual murderer.</span></p>

Is that so?” Yan Tianxing remarked. “Could the two brothers be bewitched? If that is the case…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What utter nonsense!! I can’t even bring myself to laugh at it!!” Qin Long barked, “Bewitchment?! My son was fine just the day before and when he was at the auction, how could he possibly have been bewitched? Illusionary arts wouldn’t even be able to influence a person’s emotions to self-destruct in the first place! You’re using an excuse for your crimes, but these excuses are utterly ridiculous!!”</span></p>

Little Hao and Feng were with me just an hour ago, and the both of them were just fine! How could the two of them be under the influence of any technique during that time? Hints of bewitchment would be noticeable to see, would they not? And I’ve never heard of anything that could possibly influence a person to decide to self-destruct! You are spouting nonsense of the highest order!”</span></p>

Then who is willing to testify?!”</span></p>

Those who had been there when the two brothers died were especially quiet.</span></p>

He knew that it’d be hard for anyone to want to testify in this case. The Qin wasn’t a family anyone would want to anger for no reason, especially if it meant sticking their necks out for someone they didn’t even know.</span></p>

What Bai Yunfei said earlier is true! The two brothers were the ones to self-destruct! Bai Yunfei didn’t even do anything that’d kill them!”</span></p>
