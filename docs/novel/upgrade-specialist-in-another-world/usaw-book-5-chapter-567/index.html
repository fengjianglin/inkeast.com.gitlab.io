 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And the five fingers on his right hand were all bent at an awkward angle—they had all been broken!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had activated the +10 additional effect of the Critical Glove upon impact—a critical blow worth three times the normal strength! Without putting in the proper amount of soulforce to defend himself or even realizing the damage, the elderly man was injured without a doubt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the old man flung away by Bai Yunfei, that left Cao Jun wide open to fall prey to Bai Yunfei’s hand. Before he could even react, Cao Jun felt himself be swung like a sack of potatoes into the five soldiers around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang bang!”</span></p>

In his hurry to protect himself, the soldier forgot about the dagger he had been holding. When he hit Cao Jun, the dagger had cut at Cao Jun’s leg just deep enough to draw blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than a moment, Cao Jun’s group had suffered a crushing defeat!</span></p>

But because of his fingers on the man’s throat, all Cao Jun was capable of doing was breath rather strangely as he struggled to detach himself from Bai Yunfei. Already his eyes were starting to roll towards the back of his head from oxygen deprivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single person but Bai Yunfei was in shock at what had happened. The elder still on the ground had his eyes bugged wide open, the soldiers were all afraid of moving, lest Bai Yunfei harm their charge anymore. Fang Tianmeng’s hand had flown straight to her mouth in her shock, and Ye Yu right next to her was absolutely gobsmacked. Even Zheng Kai, while not amazingly shocked like the others, tsked twice in his admiration of Bai Yunfei’s swiftness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In less than two blinks of an eye, a peak late-stage Soul Exalt was knocked away, an early-stage Soul Exalt was captured, and five Soul Ancestors were scattered into defeat. This was not a result anyone expected to see so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder’s head was slick with sweat now, though it still remained to be seen if it was due to the pain from his right arm or by the fact that Bai Yunfei seemed to be strangling Cao Jun to death. “Stop!! Don’t kill him!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His cry garnered no response from Bai Yunfei, who at the moment seemed to be looking a little strangely himself….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Cao Jun had been swung around in the air and cut by the dagger by one of his soldiers, some blood from the wound had splashed onto Bai Yunfei’s face. A droplet or two had even made its way into his left eye, stopping him for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His right hand was paused in the air with Cao Jun still held tightly in it. In his one second of blanking out, his left hand drew up to wipe the blood from his cheek. Though he got some off, his cheek was still splashed with several droplets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Noting the red blood on his left hand as he blinked his left eye several times due to the blood, Bai Yunfei could only see redness from the left side. For another two seconds, another strange flash of light came across both his eyes….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could hear a scream of sorts somewhere, but that wasn’t important right now. Sensing that Cao Jun was still struggling his hands, his eyes refocused the man’s face, Bai Yunfei loosened his hand, allowing Cao Jun to drop to the ground and gasp for air in several heavy gulps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder sighed in relief as he watched Bai Yunfei drop Cao Jun. He was slightly bitter that the opponent was so unbelievably strong. As he was now, he doubted that he’d be able to fend off any of the opponent’s attacks, and if Cao Jun was held captive, there was nothing he’d be able to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Climbing back to his feet with one hand holding onto his right, the elder slowly stepped forwards. “Sire,” He began to speak with his most negotiable voice, “this was all just a misunderstanding, we were foolish to not know our places. Please forgive us for this slight sire. Let go of the young master and the house of Cao will defi—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gut wrenching howl was heard before the elder could finish his sentence, causing the elder to turn pale with fright when he saw why!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had raised his right foot up while the elder was talking, stepping down heavily onto Cao Jun’s injured right foot in the next moment. There was the crisp sound of bone snapping as Bai Yunfei exerted some force, continuing to do so even after breaking the bone!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the strange thing was, while Cao Jun was screaming his lungs out, there was a….an unbothered look in the eyes of Bai Yunfei!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared coldly at the howling Cao Jun beneath him. “Did you not say you’d break an arm and leg of mine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I—I….do-don’t kill...please….I…” Cao Jun was close to faint, his mouths barely coherent as he tried to plead for his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei landed a swift kick onto Cao Jun’s stomach to flip onto his back. Lifting his right leg again, Bai Yunfei stepped onto his right arm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chirp!!”</span></p>

Rainbow light exploded from its body before a hundred purple lightning bolts crackled outwards to strike at the five Soul Ancestors and preventing them from getting within five meters of Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder avoided each of the lightning bolts. Since his right hand was out of commission, he could only lift his left hand to bring out a giant blade to swing it down onto his head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spark of fire shot across Bai Yunfei’s eyes. Whirling to meet the elder head on, Bai Yunfei’s right hand flew out. The blade came down onto his arm, but was unable to go any further!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For helping him in his crime….you are just as guilty!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei’s voice had been frosty, scaring even the elder. Clutching his left hand tightly, Bai Yunfei punched at the chest of the elder, cracking bones as he punched the man away. There was a small dent in the elder’s chest now, and a mouthful of blood came out from his mouth as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man was unfortunately very unlucky. He was a peak late-stage Soul Exalt, but even he wasn’t able to avoid being hit and injured by Bai Yunfei on behalf of trying to save Cao Jun. And with the strange methods of Bai Yunfei, the man wasn’t able to properly defend against Bai Yunfei before being hit again.</span></p>

His face was completely blank without emotions, but his eyes revealed a bloodthirsty look in them, making a strange contrast.</span></p>
