 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

According to our appraiser, this item is fragments of an unknown object discovered by accident in the Soulbeast Forest. We are clueless about what the object might’ve been, but the material is very special and is like the crafting stone.”</span></p>

Our lord-mayor of Swallow City, Marquis Yan, came by to evaluate this object himself. In his words, Marquis Yan proclaimed that this crafting stone can be evaluated as a mid-heaven tier. It can greatly enhance the chances of success when crafting a mid-heaven tier and perhaps even help improve the chances of crafting a high-heaven tier as well. Bringing this object to the Crafting School will definitely be of a great boon to anyone.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had at some point flew to his feet to stare at the tremendous chunk of jade with eyes filled with excited desire.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His reaction had alarmed Tang Xinyun. Though she too felt that the object being auctioned right now was a little special for its effects, what was there to be so excited about? She was confused by his reaction. This crafting stone was simply just something that could aid the success rate of a mid-heaven tier soul armament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even without such a stone, Bai Yunfei had managed to craft a mid-heaven tier soul armament without much difficulty, so…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Nephrite…that’s a fragment of the Nephrite Throne!” Bai Yunfei replied. “That’s definitely a fragment of it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Tang Xinyun’s eyes widened in disbelief. “The Nephrite Throne? Are you…saying one of the Ten Great Regalia, the Nephrite Throne?! I remember you saying that it broke into several fragments in the Soulbeast Forest, didn’t it? And…the fragments became a strange ‘Guaranteed upgrade Stone’....this stone is also a fragment of the Nephrite Throne?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Exactly! And this has to be the biggest fragment of it! There were portions of the Nephrite Throne that fell into the river and was flushed away. I looked for hours but couldn’t find some of the pieces…but here it is now! And look at the size of it…that’s definitely a +12 Guaranteed Upgr—no, a +13 Guaranteed Upgrade Stone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was right! The item the house was currently auctioning wasn’t just an ordinary ‘crafting stone’ (upgrade stone)! It was a very rare ‘Guaranteed Upgrade Stone’! A fragment of the Nephrite Throne!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nephrite Throne was one of the Ten Great Regalia. It’s previous ‘master’ had been the Black Dragon King who used it back in Soulbeast Forest as bait so it could run away when it was being surrounded by its enemies. Bai Yunfei and a Soul Exalt from the Soul Refining School had found and fought over the item. The Nephrite Throne ended up shattering due to the struggle, but Bai Yunfei found out that the fragments could be used to guarantee a successful upgrade on items!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The +13 of his Fire-tipped Spear, the +11 and +12 of his Soul Sentinel Scarf, and the +11 and +12 of his Ardent Sun Glove had been entirely because of these such Guaranteed Upgrade Stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His insights on the Upgrade Technique had been primarily because of these stones as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of his guaranteed upgrade stones were used up already despite his constant search for them. Unfortunately for Bai Yunfei, he couldn’t even find normal upgrade stones, let alone the Guaranteed Upgrade Stones. According to what he knew to this point, only the fragments of the Nephrite Throne had the ability to guarantee upgrades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei asked Xiao Fang once before on the specifics behind the Nephrite Throne. He wanted to know what kind of material the throne was made from, but his answer had been a disappointing one. Xiao Fang had said that Tianhun had once found a meteorite with a jadeite material at its center. The man took that material and forged the Nephrite Throne from it, but there had been no leftover material. Even if Bai Yunfei looked for it, there would probably be nothing like it in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t like Bai Yunfei wasn’t willing to go back to the Soulbeast Forest to look for the fragments, but he knew his chances were as slim as finding a needle in the ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He just never expected that a fragment of the Nephrite Throne would appear here of all places!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fragment was even larger than the +12 Guaranteed Upgrade Stone he used before, but also marginally smaller than the +13. Without being able to touch it, Bai Yunfei couldn’t guarantee which one it was, but he was interested in the item nonetheless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even more importantly, Bai Yunfei knew that if he used this to upgrade an item, the ‘Planar Laws’ would be attracted to him. He’d be able to take another step in figuring out the mystery behind that power! This fragment of the throne was necessary for him to understand another layer of the Upgrade Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

His ‘silence’ was stunning to everyone, and people began to gesticulate to themselves—perhaps Bai Yunfei wasn’t interested in it? Or was he perhaps running out of soul armaments and couldn’t muster up enough heaven-tier soul armaments for this crafting stone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Six hundred and fifty-thousand low-grade primal stones!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Six hundred and eighty-thousand low-grade primal stones!”</span></p>
