 <p>Chapter 492: Coming to Kill</p>
 <p>At the southern gates of Ventia City.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was taking Xiao Lan and Xiao Qi out from the city and away onto the official roads.</p>
 <p>After killing Xing Luo and the other two, Bai Yunfei had no desire to stay there.</p>
 <p>He was as calm as he could be. He wasn’t running away for his life, but he didn’t want to stick around either, hence why he was just ‘running’.</p>
 <p>Now that it was five in the afternoon, the streets were primarily empty of people. Walking quickly with purpose, Bai Yunfei ensured that he was walking faster than the others, and in time, he was well out of Ventia City and far away enough to have the city be only a blur now.</p>
 <p>Several kilometers away, Bai Yunfei was now by a wide river where the only way across was a stone bridge. As he was about to step on it, Bai Yunfei found himself looking backwards.</p>
 <p>“They’re finally here? Looks like trouble’s here then….”</p>
 <p>He sighed, but he knew that the house of Xing wouldn’t dawdle on a matter like this, and the only thing that helped hm in this matter was him leaving the city sooner rather than later. If the Xing hadn’t found enough evidence, they wouldn’t have caught up to Bai Yunfei so quickly, but since they were here already, that meant the obvious had happened and a fight was in bound.</p>
 <p>Fleeing wasn’t an option for him. If they wanted to take revenge for Xing Luo, then so be it.</p>
 <p>Already seeing several people of the Soul Exalt coming out from Ventia City, Bai Yunfei looked around himself, and then to his companions to start traveling across the river.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t running, he was just stepping away from the main roads and the bridge. A battle would definitely destroy the bridge, and that’d impact the lives of the commoners that lived here. If he could help it, Bai Yunfei wanted to avoid causing too much environmental damage.</p>
 <p>The people chasing him from behind sped up when they saw Bai Yunfei move. Clearly, they thought Bai Yunfei was trying to escape.</p>
 <p>Fire formed underneath his feet as Bai Yunfei stepped through the air over the river. Xiao Lan was traveling beneath him over the surface of the water, though its movements didn’t disturb the surface of the water in the slightest, as no ripples were coming out from where Xiao Lan stepped from.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei came to a stop roughly five kilometers afterwards. They were in a valley now, with two tall mountains standing next to each other and a river flowing nearby.</p>
 <p>As he came to a stop, the group chasing him from the city came to a stop several meters away.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked over to see who was chasing him.</p>
 <p>There was a late-stage Soul Exalt, two mid-stage Soul Exalts, and five early-stage Soul Exalts. There was also a late-stage class six soulbeast, two mid-stage class six soulbeasts, and three early-stage class six soulbeasts.</p>
 <p>Almost everyone here had soulbeasts of their own!</p>
 <p>This was definitely due to their close proximity to the Soulbeast Forest. With how wide the Tianhun Continent was, it was rare for people to have contracted soulbeasts, even Soul Exalts.</p>
 <p>“Ah? <em>He’s</em> here?” Bai Yunfei gave a small start in surprise. There was someone he ‘knew’! This person was one of the people that tried to capture the blue-eyes wyrm earlier, the late-stage Soul Exalt! He came riding on over with an equally familiar soulbeast, the late-stage class six tornado bird!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei also noticed one of the mid-stage Soul Exalts had a familiar looking mid-stage class six three-eyed kong bear.</p>
 <p>Come to think of it, Bai Yunfei could’ve sworn he remembered these people calling themselves as people from the ‘Xing’....</p>
 <p><em>“Didn’t think I’d meet them here. Guess I can’t avoid a fight this time….” He sighed, “I didn’t think much when they were with the soul refiner, but they probably have some sort of connection to the Soul Refining School…..”</em></p>
 <p>As he was thinking, the other group of people overtook it, seeing to Bai Yunfei being completely surrounded.</p>
 <p>Xing Qiufeng glared at Bai Yunfei first, and then to Xiao Qi and the blue-eyes wyrm next to him. “Are you the one who killed a man from the Xing?!” He demanded.</p>
 <p>“I am the one.” Bai Yunfei nodded.</p>
 <p>His ‘confession’ surprised Xing Qiufeng a little bit. “You’ve balls!” He replied, “Who are you to look down upon the house of Xing? To injure and kill so many innocent people without remorse, prepare to die here today!”</p>
 <p>But Bai Yunfei snorted in disdain. “You of all people want to talk to me about reason? Don’t play the idiot. You just want to take revenge for Xing Luo. If you’ve the skill, then come. If you can win, then you can deal with me as you wish!!”</p>
 <p>“You!!” Xing Qiufeng cried out, “The audacity of you! I should cripple you and take you back to the Xing to see how to punish you!</p>
 <p>“Take him!!”</p>
 <p>Everyone with him flew into action at his command, elemental energy of all kinds shining in the air to fill up the place with light.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get this over with!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei spat, his Cataclysmic Seal spitting out the essence fireseed in it to have Bai Yunfei absorb it into him.</p>
 <p>“Chirp!”</p>
 <p>“Roar!!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi and Xiao Lan flew into action faster than the opposing side. Xiao Qi’s wings unfurled to a wingspan of ten meters as the Wind and Lightning Feathers shined in him. Hundreds of blades of wind flew through the air to attack the people to the left of Bai Yunfei. Xiao Lan’s entire body grew in size until it was ten meters in height and blue in color. At the same time, the river underneath its feet churned violently before four waterspouts surged into the air to stab at the four people to Bai Yunfei’s right with the sharpness of swords.</p>
 <p>Their sudden actions surprised the group, and all of them were forced to put up a barrier in order to protect themselves before it collided with them.</p>
 <p>Due to his preconceived notion that Bai Yunfei was ‘too weak’, Xing Qiufeng didn’t see a need to act until the blue-eyes wyrm suddenly grew in size. When it saw the wyrm in its proper size, his eyes widened in shock.</p>
 <p>“That’s...that’s the blue-eyes wyrm!!”</p>
 <p>There had been a sliver of doubt when Xing Qiufeng first saw the wyrm. Since it was miniature-sized, he didn’t think too much about it. But now that he was face to face with it, and its aura was fully revealed….he remembered it as the same one he met in the Soulbeast Forest several months ago!</p>
 <p>How could he not be surprised!</p>
 <p>In the next second, Xing Qiufeng shivered, his eyes radiating with fear!</p>
 <p>“If the blue-eyes wyrm is here, then….”</p>
 <p>Before he could answer his own question, someone suddenly cried out in abject horror from the elemental energy filled area in front of him!</p>
