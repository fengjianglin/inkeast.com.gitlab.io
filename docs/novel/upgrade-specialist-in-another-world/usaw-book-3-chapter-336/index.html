 <p>Chapter 336: The Collision of Two Fireseeds! (Third)</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear, the Ardent Sun Gloves, the Flameblade Bracer, the Returner Bracer, the Eighty-one Fold Fist Force, the Lightning Bolt Dagger and the Glacial Pricker—</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>Not a single one had helped him overcome this foe…</p>
 <p>And now, his biggest crutch, the Cataclysmic Seal, had been overpowered by the same foe!!</p>
 <p>This time, Bai Yunfei really was out of trump cards. Every technique he knew, every item he owned, they had all been exhausted…</p>
 <p>Ta Shan on the other hand didn’t look much different after he had used his technique. Squatting down on the ground with both palms touching it, he fixed his Terra Armor once more. With his body and armor both currently recovering from the previous ordeal, Ta Shan wasn’t in a good enough state to deal the finishing blow to Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>But it wouldn’t take long for him to be able to. All he needed to do was relax for a moment. Then, he’d be able to finish the battle.</p>
 <p>The fearsome look in Ta Shan’s eye unnerved Bai Yunfei since he didn’t have much soulforce. He had to make use of the 300 points of soulforce stockpiled in his ring in a hurried attempt to replenish himself. As it filled his body, Bai Yunfei’s eyes flickered with light as he tried to assess the danger in front of him.</p>
 <p><em>“What do I do? What do I do!? Isn’t there any way I can win? Any type of secret technique? Any of the flying daggers? The Compliant Rope? The Walkon Strawhat!? Dammit all! I used to think I had more equipment than I knew what to do with, but now, not a single one of them can help me!!”</em></p>
 <p>The joints in his knuckles cracked rhythmically from the pressure being exerted in them. Bai Yunfei found his newly reformed essence fireseed starting to pulse rather erratically. Perhaps as an effect, the elemental fire in him started to flow erratically as well.</p>
 <p><em>“Wha??”</em> It was then that he realized something. The fireseed essence in his body just had to be planning something if it was moving like that. If he concentrated on it, he could just faintly detect an odd sensation fluttering in his heart.</p>
 <p>It felt as if… something was being called for… something that had once been with him but had been lost, but now the connection to it was slowly being rebuilt…</p>
 <p><em>“That’s… that’s my essence fireseed!”</em></p>
 <p>The summoning cry had knocked Bai Yunfei for a loop; it was trying to call to the essence fireseed in the Cataclysmic Seal!</p>
 <p>Elation started to fill his body now that he knew what was going on,<em>&nbsp;“This is it! I’ve still something up my sleeve! Something I can use!”</em></p>
 <p>After being forcibly knocked onto the ground by Ta Shan, the fireseed essence that was in the Cataclysmic Seal finally started to give off traces of existence!!</p>
 <p>After months of slumber, it was finally awake!</p>
 <p>If the fireseed essence was awake, then the battle outside Curopia CIty could be repeated. With the fireseed essence, the power of the Cataclysmic Seal would drastically rise!</p>
 <p><em>“This is my last hope… you’ve been asleep for so long, so it’s about time you wake up!!”</em></p>
 <p>Reinvigorated and refocused, Bai Yunfei stared heavily at the Cataclysmic Seal while wishing in his heart for the essence fireseed to awaken!</p>
 <p>It didn’t feel like there was enough power in it.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, the essence fireseed had woke up, but it wasn’t fully awake.</p>
 <p>By this point, Ta Shan was already getting back on his feet. Worried about what he’d do next, Bai Yunfei stared at him with clenched fists.</p>
 <p>His right fist slammed into his chest, <em>“Damn it! You better wake up! Otherwise, I’ll use you to fuel the Cataclysmic Seal again!!”</em></p>
 <p>His mental roar of anger had been the impetus that the essence fireseed in his body needed to explode in activity. It thought Bai Yunfei would really force it out his body.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a spark jolted through Bai Yunfei’s body, allowing him to feel as though something important was being established. The connections that had slowly been built between him and the fireseed essence were now reconnecting at a hastened pace, allowing a tremendous amount of power to pour out of his very soul. The power flowed to each and every corner of his body, replenishing him with power while his fireseed essence started to ‘crackle’ to life.</p>
 <p>“Bzz...” The partially submerged Cataclysmic Seal behind him started to vibrate where it was. Waves of red light and elemental fire started to billow out, and with the bewildered Ta Shan as witness, a fist-sized fireseed slowly started to float out of the Cataclysmic Seal.</p>
 <p>By an act of osmosis, the soul armament and the fireseed were dividing. The moment it successfully escaped from its confines, the fireseed flew straight for Bai Yunfei. It ‘dove’ right into his body before he could even understand what it was doing!!</p>
 <p>He had originally been planning to use the newly awakened fireseed essence to power up the Cataclysmic Seal again, so when it fully awakened, Bai Yunfei was surprised that it’d dive into his body so suddenly!</p>
 <p>It hadn’t even reached Bai Yunfei’s heart, but the fireseed was already starting to feel like it was at ‘home.’ Traveling through Bai Yunfei’s body with practiced ease, it returned to his core—the origin acupoint.</p>
 <p>When it arrived at the origin acupoint, the fireseed was quick to discover that it wasn’t empty…</p>
 <p>There was another fireseed existing at its core!</p>
 <p>Then… the two fireseeds trembled violently before colliding with one another…</p>
 <p>“Booom!!!!!”</p>
 <p>It was as though a mental bomb had exploded within Bai Yunfei’s mind. Not only was there a dreadfully loud sound, a wave of fire exploded from both fireseeds and the origin acupoint flooded his entire body with elemental fire.</p>
 <p>Even his body wasn’t enough to contain it all. It hit its limit and elemental fire started to explode out!</p>
 <p>The explosion of fire was like his body had been dipped into lava; it was unbelievably hot and painful!!</p>
 <p>“Aaaghhhhh!!!”</p>
 <p>All of the muscles in Bai Yunfei’s face spasmed with pain. His head snapped back as he let loose a powerful roar as all of the elemental fire in his body started to flow out.</p>
 <p>The elemental fire outside his body started to violently surge, like the forming of a typhoon. It completely enveloped Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>The wave of pain that shot through him threatened to knock him unconscious. Even though he wasn’t clear of mind, there was a feeling of contrast.</p>
 <p>He felt even more ‘free’ than ever.</p>
 <p>He felt as though if he wanted to, he could split apart the sky just by raising his fist!</p>
 <p><em>“Wha—what’s going on!? How’s he getting all this power. It’s inconceivable!!”</em></p>
 <p>Ta Shan was currently lost in his own thoughts. They persisted for only a few seconds before he cleared his mind and prepared to kill once more!</p>
 <p>For some reason, fear was starting to rise up in his mind.</p>
 <p>It was laughable, to say the least.</p>
 <p>How could a Soul Exalt ever fear a young Soul Ancestor!?</p>
 <p><em>“I can’t let him grow any stronger! I’ve got to kill him, now!”</em></p>
 <p>Roaring to himself as he leaped, Ta Shan flew forward to strike Bai Yunfei down with all his might.</p>
 <p>A ring of fire flew off Bai Yunfei’s body when he realized Ta Shan’s movements. Tilting his head, Bai Yunfei stared at Ta Shan with both of his fiery eyes for just a second before he…</p>
 <p>Disappeared!!</p>
 <p>He was gone without anything but a flash of fire from where he used to stand.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had disappeared from Ta Shan’s very eyes!</p>
 <p>Ta Shan was a Soul Exalt with all the perception granted to someone of his calibre, yet Bai Yunfei had disappeared without a trace!</p>
 <p>Another second later, the burning heat of elemental fire could be felt right behind Ta Shan. Eyes dilating in fear, Ta Shan tried to turn around. Both of his hands were ready to protect himself, but…</p>
 <p>It was too late!!</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang!!”</p>
 <p>There were the two distinct sounds of something being hit.</p>
 <p>Just slightly above Ta Shan in the air was Bai Yunfei. Both of his hands were outstretched right next to Ta Shan’s neck!!</p>
 <p>A double Eighty-one Fold Fist Force!!</p>
