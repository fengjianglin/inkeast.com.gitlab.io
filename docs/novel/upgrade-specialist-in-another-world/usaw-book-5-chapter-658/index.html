It was only because of Xiao Nan that an all out fight hadn’t happened. While Bai Yunfei knew Xu Sihan was Xiao Nan’s cousin from his wife’s side, what was Xu Sihan doing here still?</span></p>

He trawled a little hesitantly to Zhao Jie’s side to whisper, “Cousin, I….”</span></p>

Your family might’ve sent you over, but your cousin isn’t here to force you to do anything. If you want to leave, go, but I won’t stop them from punishing you if you do.”</span></p>

I wanted to take the chance today to apologize on his behalf. Little Han has been spoiled by his family since he was small and his behavior isn’t always the best. I hope today you and he will be able to work things out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ehh???”</span></p>

Biting his lips, he forced himself to look at Bai Yunfei with an earnest expression. “I unintentionally offended brother Bai the other day. Please excuse the slight I’ve made and forgive this one for it.”</span></p>

He had never expected Xu Sihan to apologize like this. He hadn’t even thought about Xu Sihan at all, in fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since his conflict with the family of the Right Minister, the matter with Xu Sihan and the Left Minister had been completely overshadowed, and Bai Yunfei didn’t bother to think much about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Bai Yunfei didn’t know was that there were others that took this event pretty seriously. The house of Xu. It wasn’t a major topic, though the higher-ups of the family had still managed to hear about it. As it so happened, they also heard about how Bai Yunfei also got into a conflict with Cheng Xin and then even the four sons of the other families that got along with the Cheng. When it ended with the five of them eating a loss, the Xu snickered to themselves and admitted that it was Xu Sihan that offended Bai Yunfei rather than the other way around, which is why the higher-ups didn’t care much for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mess the Cheng was in now was all in due part with how their pampered son had angered Bai Yunfei, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So the elders of the Xu sent out the order to have Xu Sihan not only cease his hostilities with Bai Yunfei, but to apologize!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was in personal status or strength, Bai Yunfei was racking up a great deal of value in the eyes of many other influential powers in the Capital. If this series of events with the Cheng was making them an enemy out of Bai Yunfei, then the Xu—who were fundamentally opposed to them—would definitely want to have Bai Yunfei’s support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Or at the very least, not make an enemy out of him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sihan had actually wanted to form a ‘feud’ with Bai Yunfei as well after he was hurt. But then when he heard about the conflict between Bai Yunfei and Cheng Xin, he grew a little cautious and decided to take the ‘wait and see’ approach. Things got even more unpredictable with Bai Yunfei dealing with the experts from the Li, Zeng, Zhu, and Peng ordered to ‘deal’ with him. Disbelieving almost at Bai Yunfei’s victory, Xu Sihan was starting to doubt the reasonability that was his grudge. At the same time, he was given a stern ‘talking’ to by his elders and was told to apologize to Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As hedonistic as he was, Xu Sihan was no simpleton. He could see how serious the elders were, and he didn’t dare go against their demands. Remembering that Bai Yunfei got along with his cousin and husband, Xu Sihan went reluctantly to them to see if his cousin would be able to help out or be ‘mediators’ at the very least. He felt quite embarrassed to be making the apologies, since he had never had to ‘apologize’ with him being the son of the Left Minister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stunned look on Bai Yunfei’s face gave Xiao Nan the impression that Bai Yunfei wasn’t quite ready to forgive Xu Sihan, so he decided to speak up. “Yunfei, I was there at the time and know that Xu Sihan’s behavior wasn’t right. However, I’ve already punished him several times after that and so I’ll hope you’ll spare me some face and forgive him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Nan didn’t really like Xu Sihan in truth, but he was still related to him through his wife, and the two of them were on good terms with one another. Zhao Jie herself had asked Xiao Nan if an apology could be arranged on Xu Sihan’s behalf so that the hatchet could be buried between him and Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blinking oddly at the sight, Bai Yunfei waved his hand, “Big brother Xiao, you are far too serious with your words. I...haven’t even thought about the events that day, let alone think about forgiving or not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Bai Yunfei had already taught Xu Sihan a lesson, he never really thought about the matter. He wasn’t one to split hairs over everything and form long-lasting grudges with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If only Cheng Xin himself were to come and do the same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sihan sighed to himself inwardly. He had been worried that Bai Yunfei would turn the nose and try to humiliate him. To have this matter resolved so easy had done wonders for his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then…thank you for your magnanimity, brother Bai. This is just a small gift of my thanks, please accept it on my behalf.” Xu Sihan took out a white stone from his space ring and sent it over to Bai Yunfei in a bubble of elemental energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was giving a gift too?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was doubly alarmed. Planning to refuse the gift at first, Bai Yunfei opened his mouth to do so when he saw the object floating over to him. Eyes sparkling when he recognized what it was, Bai Yunfei accepted the item and took it straight into his space ring. “Then this one will thank you for your kindness, lord Xu.

It wasn’t a bad thing either to make friends with the Xu and the Left Minister, so Bai Yunfei took the gift without much of a fuss.</span></p>

By accepting the gift, Bai Yunfei would most likely not treat him bad in the future. He was a little fearful of Bai Yunfei and didn’t want to end up a half-cripple almost like Cheng Xin and his group….</span></p>

Xu Sihan had dropped the hedonistic air he normally had and wasn’t quite the disgusting person Bai Yunfei first pegged him to be, causing Bai Yunfei to have a new perspective on him.</span></p>

I know what I’m saying might make you suspicious of me trying to instigate some disharmony, but I truly am speaking honestly here. Cheng Xin came to me a few days before and wanted to know if I had a grudge with you, brother Bai. He wanted to see if I’d be interested in taking revenge, but I refused. I think he and his friends haven’t given up yet, so I wanted to inform you of the potential, brother Bai.”</span></p>
