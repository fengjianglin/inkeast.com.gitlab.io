 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

They’re from the Soul Refining School. I was in the Southward River Province one month ago for the Extreme King Pills when I fought against the person…” Bai Yunfei offered up respectfully before telling the entire audience what happened during that time.</span></p>

A lot of them had a relieved look though. The Tang had in fact been planning on taking part in the race for the Extreme King Pills, but they ultimately decided not to due to time constraints. Had they done so and came across the murderous Mo Ni, most of the participating members surely would’ve died.</span></p>

Now that he thought about it, the people he wiped out were certainly not lacking in power in the slightest.

But the fact that the wandering soul cultivators were even willing to align themselves with the school was certainly not a negligible thing.</span></p>

A high-ranking elder at that. He became well known sixty years ago when he and the headmaster of the Soul Refining School killed many well-known figures. I fought him once before, but the two of us were only Mid-stage Soul Kings at the time. It took a whole day and night before our battle concluded with me as the victor, but he managed to flee before I could kill him. He stayed in the shadows after that, and I focused on my own training afterward.

This final thing he spoke about had been a pseudo-secret of sorts that no one really touched upon. But now it was out onto the table to be addressed.

At first, it took a great deal of energy to kill the first Mid-stage Soul King. The other two Soul Kings were slightly easier with him primarily using an overwhelming amount of power to kill them, and even the Late-stage Soul King he killed in the Core World had been easy due to the overwhelming difference in battle strength. In this, Bai Yunfei had to count his lucky stars it went as well as it did.</span></p>

If the people he fought were all strong figures, then the things they left behind would most definitely be of high standards.</span></p>

The first up would be the rings of the dozen Soul Exalts killed by Xiao Qi.&nbsp;</span></p>

The most valuable thing was a single heaven-tier soul armament, but even that was hardly worth calling a low-heaven tier. The rest of the items in those rings were either earth-tier soul armaments or primal stones, the latter of which wasn’t of much use to Bai Yunfei and his training.</span></p>

Separating the items, he sealed them away and moved on.</span></p>

First would be the rings of the three Early-stage Soul Kings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Much to his disappointment, Bai Yunfei failed to find much in any of their rings. Every single one of them had a type of low-heaven tier armor, but it was the armor they had been wearing when they died and were damaged. There were also a few offensive low-heaven tier soul armaments, but they were of general make and had no special attributes to them. For as excited Bai Yunfei was about finding goodies, he was downtrodden to see such a sparse bounty in their space rings. How could Soul Kings be lacking anything valuable and special?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Should the source of his disappointment be known to anyone else, they definitely would’ve vomited blood. Surely, this was the attitude anyone significantly wealthy enough would have towards riches. A single heaven-tier soul armament would have caused a stir in an auction house if they appeared. Those Soul Kings Bai Yunfei killed definitely must have spent an unordinary amount of time in order to get their hands on said heaven-tier soul armaments. To have Bai Yunfei treat the soul armaments this way was almost appalling.</span></p>

He took out the orange spear the elder had been using so prominently.</span></p>

Besides, he had the Fire-tipped Spear which simply couldn’t be replaced. He didn’t want to use two spears at the same time either, so there wasn’t much of a point to this one…&nbsp;</span></p>
