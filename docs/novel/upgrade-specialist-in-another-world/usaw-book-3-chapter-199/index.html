 <p>Chapter 199: Ardent Sun Glove, A Glove That Has Both Attack and Defense! (Third)</p>
 <p>Slackening at the information that swam into his mind, the hand that was touching the dagger immediately relinquished it. Now untouched by Bai Yunfei, the dagger regained its ability to float and returned back into ‘line.’</p>
 <p>Just barely, Bai Yunfei could feel the slightest of elemental fire circling the area around them. Even the soul armaments had the same feeling. Casting an eye to the silent first elder on the right side of the room, Bai Yunfei thought to himself with some awe, <em>“Just what type of strength is required for a feat like this??”</em></p>

 <p>……</p>
 <p>Nearly half an hour passed before Bai Yunfei was able to get a good look at nearly all the soul armaments there. By his side, Ye Zhiqiu looked as if he had already made up his mind.</p>
 <p><em>“All of them are low-grade Regalia. That means they’re the same as low-heaven tier equipment… the strongest one is at 2865 attack too; that means the threshold to a low-grade Regalia has to be between two thousand and three thousand in either attack or defense…”</em> Bai Yunfei’s head nodded with that conclusion, he wasn’t in much of a rush to select a soul armament; now was the time to find out the most impertinent information for the sake of his Upgrade Technique.</p>
 <p><em>“Well, which one should I take? A weapon or armor?”</em> Bai Yunfei looked up once more at the floating pieces of soul armament with indecision. There were a few soul armaments that he really liked out of the ones here, but he wasn’t very determined to make a choice yet.</p>
 <p>This was the most troublesome part—what decision should he make?</p>
 <p>In the middle of his wavering indecisiveness, something out of the corner of his right eye suddenly sparked his attention and curiosity.</p>
 <p><em>“That’s…”</em></p>
 <p>Turning about, Bai Yunfei walked two steps closer and stretched out his right hand to grab the floating soul armament in front of him.</p>
 <p>It was a single black and purple colored glove for the right hand.</p>
 <p>The material was supple and light, weighing nothing at the touch. The glove itself exposed half of the fingers so that the sense of touch could still be had. On the back of the glove was a red symbol depicting the burning sun.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong>Equipment Grade: Low&nbsp;Regalia<p></p><p>Attack:&nbsp;2236</p><p>Defense: 2580</p></strong><p><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 160 Soulpoints</strong></p></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>The expression on Bai Yunfei’s face instantly became rigid. In contrast, his mind was in a state of chaos as he tried to ensure that nothing showed on his face.</p>
 <p><em>“Wa—wha? This… this equipment has both attack and defense!!”</em></p>
 <p>With such a huge discovery like this, how could Bai Yunfei not be surprised!?</p>
 <p>Up until now, Bai Yunfei had never seen a piece of equipment like this. All of them were either attack only or defense only. An equipment with both of them was a completely unprecedented thing!</p>
 <p>Just because a piece of equipment displayed only attack didn’t mean that it had no defense. A giant sword could be used for defense if, for example, a throwing knife was thrown at it. The same case applied for defensive equipment. A shield was purely meant to be a defense item, but it could still be smashed against a person as a means of attack.</p>
 <p>The Upgrade Technique would only show the ‘main’ attribute of the item.</p>
 <p>Weapons would display a stat for attack, and armor would display a stat for defense.</p>
 <p>Today, however, today was a day where Bai Yunfei was shown a single glove with both attack and defense! This meant that in the eyes of the Upgrade Technique, attack and defense for gloves were equally important!!</p>
 <p>If another set of gloves were to be compared, the Upgrade Technique would only show an attribute for defense. The fact that this purple and black glove indicated attack meant that there was some sort of special case where it could unleash an attack worthy of a Regalia!</p>
 <p>Hardly any time was left to hesitate before Bai Yunfei made his decision.</p>
 <p>He wanted them!</p>
 <p>Now that he made up his mind, Bai Yunfei hadn’t bothered to look at the rest of the equipment. Exhaling comfortably, Bai Yunfei now had a look of happiness in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Touching the insignia stitched on the gloves Bai Yunfei decided to come up with a name for it—the ‘Ardent Sun Glove’!</p>
 <p>Author Note: Please consult Kyo Kusanagi’s gloves from King of Fighters for reference.</p>
 <p>When he turned around, Bai Yunfei could see Ye Zhiqiu currently staring at a meter long sword with some hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Zhiqiu, how goes it?” Bai Yunfei whispered to him as he approached.</p>
 <p>“I’m not quite sure which of the two swords I should pick…” Ye Zhiqiu replied with a shrug.</p>
 <p>Looking closely, Bai Yunfei saw another sword of similar make beside the first. The first sword was glowing with a violet light, and the other sword was glowing with an azure light. Aside from the glows, neither sword looked weaker than the other. Even with soulsense, a distinction couldn’t be made.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Yunfei could tell at a glance that the sword on the left had an attack of 2567 while the sword on the right had an attack of 2786.</p>
 <p>“If you can’t find a difference, then why not choose one at random…” Bai Yunfei smiled, but when he suggested Ye Zhiqiu ‘choose one at random,’ his eyes were looking straight at the sword on the right.</p>
 <p>At first, Ye Zhiqiu didn’t quite understand what Bai Yunfei was getting at, but when it hit, he smiled and nodded his head, “Well then, I’ll choose this one!”</p>
 <p>His hand stretched forward to grab the azure sword on the right.</p>
 <p>Together, Ye Zhiqiu and Bai Yunfei returned back to where Kou Changkong and the other elders were.</p>
 <p>The selection of soul armaments had puzzled the three men, even the first elder gave a barely noticeable nod of his head.</p>
 <p>He was clearly pleased with what the two chose.</p>
 <p>With a shake of his hand, the selection of soul armaments that were still floating were recalled back to his sleeved right hand. Whenever a soul armament grew within a meter radius from his hand, they immediately vanished into thin air.</p>
 <p>Just barely, Bai Yunfei could see the twinkling glow of a space ring; it must be the personal space ring worn by the first elder.</p>
 <p>No sooner did the soul armaments disappear then the entire stone room returned back to its normal light. The red glow that was once abundant in the room was now gone without a trace.</p>
 <p>“Not bad.” Kou Changkong nodded his head in satisfaction. Smiling at the two happy students, he said, “In our Crafting School, whenever a student reaches the inner school and becomes a Soul Sprite, they are given the opportunity to forge a personalized soul armament. You two, however, are already Soul Sprites, so this opportunity is lost…”</p>
 <p>Like Ye Zhiqiu, Bai Yunfei felt crestfallen by the news, but then a sudden thought hit him—no wonder everyone tried to join the Crafting School as a late-stage Soul Warrior; they knew about this opportunity beforehand.</p>
 <p>He had once heard Hong Yin say before that the Flame-tipped Spear and the Flameblade Bracer were already similar enough to being his own ‘personalized soul armament.’ Thus, Bai Yunfei had been afraid to take out either of the items when he arrived here.</p>
 <p>“Don’t feel disappointed. As disciples, there is another opportunity given so that even you two will be able to make a personalized soul armament!!” Kou Changkong spoke aloud, stunning the two students once more.</p>
 <p>Hong Yin had said that the personalized soul armaments of the Crafting School were forged from the gathering of the essence fireseed when one reached the Soul Sprite stage. By borrowing the amalgamation of pure elemental fire and soul, a soul armament could be refined and combined with the soul to create a connection between the two.</p>
 <p>And thus, a personalized soul armament was born.</p>
 <p>Since both he and Ye Zhiqiu were already Soul Sprites, was there still a chance to forge a personalized soul armament?</p>
