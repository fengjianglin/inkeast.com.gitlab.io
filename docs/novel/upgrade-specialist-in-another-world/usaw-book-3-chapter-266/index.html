 <p>Another never-before-seen effect! In the past Bai Yunfei would’ve leapt at the chance to research this effect, but this time, he only shook his head in disappointment, “Ugh… this doesn’t regenerate soulforce…”</p>

 <p>With the final +9 accessory turning to dust, Bai Yunfei could only look vacantly at the dust as it flowed through his fingers in disappointment.</p>
 <p>Out of the thirty-nine +9 pieces of equipment, only five of them managed to become +10. Having five pieces of +10 equipment was already a decent sum since the chances of being able to upgrade any equipment to +10 was drastically lower after he had become a Soul Ancestor. Out of a hundred of the equipment below Superior in grade, only two of them were able to become +10. Statistics like that were in accordance to what obtained before. Even though he had roughly the same chances as he did before, Bai Yunfei could infer that there was a correlation to be found when he had some elemental fire in him and when he didn’t.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had no desire to research that now. All he could think about was the sadness of it all—to have only five +10 accessories with none of them being able to regenerate soulforce. He was aware of such an outcome, but he still couldn’t help but feel disappointed.</p>
 <p>Of the five +10 pieces of equipment he had: two of them were rings, one was a bracelet, and the other two were earrings.</p>
 <p>Clenching the five accessories, Bai Yunfei snarled, “If +10 won’t do, then I’ll make them +12!”</p>
 <p>Focusing on one of the rings, he thought,<em> “Upgrade!”</em></p>

 <p>Out of the five +10 pieces of equipment he started with, only one was left.</p>
 <p>This was a situation Bai Yunfei had come across plenty of times by now. Despite that, he still couldn’t help but feel a great deal of disappointment this time, especially now that he was feeling sad. He had been extremely eager to upgrade one accessory to regenerate soulforce so that he could help save Xinyun, but with nothing appearing so far, he was unable to accept this outcome.</p>
 <p>There was a look of unease as Bai Yunfei eyed the remaining +11 ring in his hand. Biting his lip, Bai Yunfei shook his right hand to retrieve a small white stone.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>What he took out was the upgrade stone!</p>
 <p>Determined, Bai Yunfei spoke to himself, <em>“I have to succeed! I have to find an item with the recovery effect! I will save Xinyun, I must!!”</em></p>
 <p><em>“Upgr—”</em></p>
 <p>“Chirrp!!”</p>
 <p>Just as Bai Yunfei was about to upgrade the +11 ring, the sound of a panicked chirp flooded his ears, snapping him out of his trance.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Bai!” Bai Yunfei cried out. This chirp was a very familiar one; it was the quickshade bird of Tang Xinyun!</p>
 <p>“No! Xinyun!!”</p>
 <p>With practically no hesitation at all, Bai Yunfei leaped up from his bed. He tossed away the upgrade stone and ring and flew out of his room. Dashing through the doors, he leaped over the presiding wall to reach the other courtyard to reach the room where Tang Xinyun was.</p>
 <p>As soon as he entered the room, Bai Yunfei could see Xiao Binzi and the others seated there. Cang Yu was seated right next to the bed with an anxious look on her face as she gripped Tang Xinyun’s wrist. Xiao Binzi stood stone-faced behind Cang Yu while Jiang Fan and Song Lin both stood behind him with equally anxious faces.</p>
 <p>Running to Tang Xinyun’s bed, Bai Yunfei could see her extremely pale face was completely drenched with sweat. The strands of black energy coming off her face were extremely strange to see, and she looked like she was in extreme pain. Her face was scrunched up, and her teeth nipped at her lower lip hard enough to draw blood.</p>
 <p>The quickshade bird was the size of a very large bird as it lay by her right hand. Its head nestled against her right arm as it transmitted its soulforce into her body. The chirp earlier was from Xiao Bai, but now, the bird’s voice was barely audible as it appeared to be chirping softly into Xinyun’s ear.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei turned to Xiao Binzi, “First elder… what’s happening to Xinyun? Wasn’t she stabilized? What happened now?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Binzi sighed, “The Refining Soul Palm made its first outburst, and the resulting power wasn’t something we were expecting. At first, Xinyun’s soulforce was completely swallowed, but thankfully Xiao Bai was here to give her some of its soulforce. Since they have a soul contract with one another, Xiao Bai’s soulforce wasn’t rejected by Xinyun’s body, but the corrosive power of the Refining Soul Palm is really far too strong; even as a fifth-tier soulbeast, Xiao Bai’s soulforce is nearly running out…”</p>
 <p>If a fifth-tier soulbeast like Xiao Bai was nearly out of soulforce, the implications of what were happening with Tang Xinyun didn’t even need to be said.</p>
 <p>It was as though a bucket of ice-cold water was dropped over Bai Yunfei. “Then… what about medicine!? First elder, you’re a Soul King, there must be some sort of treasure that’ll help her, right!? Isn’t there any medicine that could save her?”</p>
 <p>Tapping a finger against his chin, Xiao Binzi sighed, “What medicine I had was… already administered to Xinyun that first night when you were asleep. The Xiao only has a few medicines as it is, and we’ve already used up all of theirs…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei fell silent.</p>
 <p>“Since those medicines didn’t work, there’s really only one method left…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s head snapped up when he heard that last remark in hope, “What method is there? What is it? First elder, please tell me!”</p>
 <p>It was Cang Yu who answered him rather than Xiao Binzi. “The last method the first elder mentioned is… to dissipate Xinyun’s essence fireseed. By harnessing that energy, she should be able to fend off the corrosive energy…”</p>
 <p>“That’s…” Bai Yunfei’s body froze up as he realized what Cang Yu was getting at. Using up Xinyun’s essence fireseed was basically using up her cultivation; which in turn meant she would return to being a Soul Warrior!?</p>
 <p>Furthermore, to recondense essence fireseed was practically impossible. It was a feat that was hundreds or even a thousand times harder than Bai Yunfei’s attempt to regenerate his essence fireseed…</p>
 <p>“Chirp!!”</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Xiao Bai let loose a chirp to alert the others in the room. Turning their heads, everyone could see the faint black wisp over Tang Xinyun’s body immediately flew toward her chest! In a flash of green light, Xiao Bai sent its soulforce into her body to start the fight with the black energy, but as soon as it did, Xiao Bai’s head dropped down to the bed from the lack of power. Its soulforce, previously stronger than Tang Xinyun’s soulforce, was now as weak as hers…</p>
 <p>“Ungh…” A small groan slipped out of Tang Xinyun’s mouth from her pain. It was soft, but to Bai Yunfei’s ears, it was as sharp and painful as a blade to his heart.</p>
 <p>The situation had taken… a turn for the worse!!</p>
