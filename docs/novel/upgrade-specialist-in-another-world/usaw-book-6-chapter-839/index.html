 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The creation of heaven-tier soul armaments was a complicated process and consumed a tremendous amount of energy. Any single person wouldn’t even be able to imagine the strain a crafter might go through to make one. In the Crafting School, the amount of energy a Soul King might use up crafting a heaven-tier soul armament was the equivalent of a commoner running well over forty kilometers of distance. So heavy would be the fatigue that several days of rest would be needed for a full reset.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Late-stage Soul King like Xiao Binzi would need to rest after making a single heaven-tier soul armament. That didn’t mean to say he didn’t have the energy to keep on going after it, but that he wouldn’t be in an optimal state. The process of crafting a heaven-tier soul armament was an arduous one that required the utmost concentration. And with the many rare materials that a heaven-tier soul armament required, not even the most experienced of crafters would be willing to undergo the chance when not at their best.Even Xiao Binzi, a late-stage Soul King, would need to take a break after crafting a heaven-tier soul armament. This didn’t mean to say he was completely exhausted whenever he crafted one, but that he wouldn’t be at an optimal state to be making another soul armament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The process of crafting a heaven-tier soul armament was one that couldn’t be done sloppily. The utmost consideration and care had to be had for the process and required multiple rare materials compared to any other soul armament. Without the right circumstances, no one from the Crafting School would even be willing to consider making a heaven-tier soul armament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet, here Xiao Binzi could see Bai Yunfei was doing just exactly that! After finishing a single soul armament, he was going straight for a second soul armament. And a heaven-tier one at that!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was stunned at Bai Yunfei’s audacity. He simply couldn’t understand Bai Yunfei’s actions; was Bai Yunfei so blind to his abilities?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rich flow of elemental fire was starting to wane now. Now half of its original volume, the energy was starting to stabilize while still maintaining the shroud of mist-like appearance around the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a surprise to Xiao Binzi. The calming of the elemental fire in such a way meant that the initial tempering of the materials was done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yanbai and the others were quick to realize what was going on as well. “Elder Xiao,” Mu Chen looked on in disbelief, “Is…is Yunfei going to be crafting a second soul armament?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While not knowledgeable about the crafting process, Mo Yanbai and the others could take the hint on what was going on. “Elder Xiao,” Mu Chen looked almost incredulous. “Is Yunfei…crafting a second soul armament?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Binzi nodded.</span></p>

This youngster has always been an impulsive student, my apologies in advance for his poor performance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Mo Yanbai had a twinkle in his eyes. “Haha, I actually find myself looking forward to what nephew Yunfei does next. Perhaps…he will surprise us all yet again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Binzi grew silent. Would Bai Yunfei be able to craft a second heaven-tier soul armament? Xiao Binzi didn’t believe so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sighed. It was far too hasty for Bai Yunfei to do as he did. Ultimately, Xiao Binzi couldn’t blame him for that. It’d do Bai Yunfei some good to have a setback now as a reminder of his own limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

Rather than leave, Xiao Binzi and the others remained in the skies to wait. Of everyone there, Xiao Binzi was the one most concentrated on the changes of the space around them, waiting to see just how long Bai Yunfei would be able to hold out until the next step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A little ways away from the elders, Zheng Kai, Song Lin, and the others were waiting as well. The other students of the Underworld School were there, though they could hardly make sense of what was going on. All they knew was that someone of the Crafting School was there crafting soul armaments, and that the Worldly Phantasm had already marked the success of one successful crafting. All that was left to do was wait for the very end for the final results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing on top of a mountain farther away from the elders, Zheng Kai, Song Lin, and the others stood together to watch. Most of the students of the Underworld School were there as well, though they didn’t understand first that someone from the Crafting School was crafting a soul armament. After they found out, everyone began to chatter and stand there patiently in hopes of being able to see the final results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Day and night made a full cycle again in Black Cloud Valley, though the elemental fire being fed into the mountain cave where Bai Yunfei was had yet to have even a single fluctuation in it. Over the course of everything, the expression on Xiao Binzi’s face had been constantly changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, Xiao Binzi had been fully convinced Bai Yunfei would fail in his second attempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, he was noticeably in awe now and eagerly awaiting for Bai Yunfei to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time another day and night went by, Xiao Binzi was thoroughly convinced and hard-pressed to hide the shock on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the dawn of the second morning, there was yet again a change in the elemental fire that astounded everyone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flow of elemental fire used to be calm, like the waterflow of a quiet river. Now, the flow was nearly chaotic, churning and billowing rapidly so that in a matter of seconds, the elemental energy was swirling around the mountain like a maelstrom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elemental fire was picking up in intensity as well. As if gaining the properties of a magnet, the maelstrom was taking in even more elemental fire from its initial hundred meter radius into itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, the maelstrom of elemental fire was nearly a kilometer in radius and nearly touching the area where Zheng Kai and the others stood. Most of the students there had already fell back in fear at the rapid growth of it, but before their fears could completely overwhelm them, the maelstrom was already starting to change in form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if a bottomless hole had suddenly appeared at its center, the maelstrom was quickly losing its mass as the elemental fire was swallowed up into the mountain peak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Crack!!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bolt of lightning was identical to the other one a few days ago. But this time, it wasn’t just one bolt this time…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another five bolts descended from the skies, but none of them slammed into the mountain. Instead, they fell behind the mountain where it was seemingly taken into the maelstrom of elemental fire and was erased from sight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bolts of lightning were starting to crackle to life all over the place now. They converged together to gave rise to one singular bolt that seemed to wriggle almost like a snake made completely of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like the maelstrom of fire, the gigantic bolt of lightning started to shrink after a while. In moments, it too, was gone behind the mountain…</span></p>

Most of them were completely bewildered by the sudden and large-scale changes going on in the world around them, but for those who knew a little bit of what was going on, such as Song Lin, were in disbelief at the sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s done it!! He’s actually managed to succeed!!”</span></p>

He couldn’t help it, he was just so surprised by the significance of what Bai Yunfei did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A split-moment after he cried out, Xiao Binzi started to grow extremely excited.</span></p>

He could hardly even believe what he was seeing.</span></p>

A mental frame of mind that could not be forcibly sought out. If there was something that could be studied, it had a realm of Enlightenment.&nbsp;</span></p>

They would be able to see through problems they would have once been stuck by, and be able to break through bottlenecks. The Enlightened Realm for crafters meant being in the best possible state of mind for crafting. In this state of mind, a crafter would have not only a better chance of crafting, but also a higher chance of being able to craft even better soul armaments.</span></p>

It required having to craft well over tens of thousands of soul armaments before such a realm could be reached. Even for Xiao Binzi, who boasted a hundred years of being a soul cultivator and crafter, had only been able to reach that state once to craft two heaven-tier soul armaments.&nbsp;</span></p>

And to not only be able to craft two heaven-tier soul armaments, but three!</span></p>

His eyes flashed once with light as he realized something off about the situation.</span></p>
