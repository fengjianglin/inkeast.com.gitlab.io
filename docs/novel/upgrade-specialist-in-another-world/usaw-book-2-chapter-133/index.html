 <p>Chapter 133: One Spear Shocks the Enemies</p>
 <p>“Stay your hands!”</p>
 <p>This sudden roar, which was accompanied by the sharp sound of wind being split, startled everyone present. A fiery-red beam shot past the area that Wu Sen had been standing the instant after he had leaped to the side. Shortly after that, an extremely strong aura of fire approached, causing Wu Sen to feel shocked. He was still in a half-squatting position as he waved his hand to summon a four-foot-tall, two-foot-wide golden shield to block in front of him.</p>
 <p>The figure of a human flashed past Wu Sen, but didn’t attack him. Instead, it headed toward the Spirit Monkey that was attacking Zhao Mancha.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Just as Wu Sen was just starting to relax, a frightful explosive sound rang out from one side. In the following moment, the elemental fire that had been terrifying him had immediately begun to spread his way. Subconsciously, he took a step back as he felt his hair get singed by this heatwave.</p>
 <p>An enormous pit with, a radius of almost twenty meters, suddenly appeared in the middle of the battlefield. A blazing spear surrounded by flames was stabbed in the center of the pit as if a divine weapon had descended.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at the spear, its tip still trembling slightly, in absolute shock. A trace of despondency flashed through the minds of everyone present, and even the soulbeasts from the Beast Taming School had paused for an instant due to their masters being distracted.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Another muffled sound could be heard, causing everyone to suddenly awaken from their stupor. When they turned their heads to look over, they could see that the Spirit Monkey which had only just been a single meter close to Zhao Mancha had been sent flying backwards. Right in front, a single figure could be seen borrowing the counterforce from his punch to barrel backwards and grab onto Zhao Mancha by the shoulder to carry her to the side.</p>
 <p>Flinging his right hand, two icy gleams of light flew out straight towards the Whirlwind Bird and the Goldfeathered Eagle who were both swooping down in that one moment. Leaping down into the pit, he gave a shake of his right arm to bring out a single long spear. Landing on his tiptoes, the man gave several quick leaps in rapid succession to come streaking down to where Tang Xinyun was in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>From when he appeared out from nowhere to when he saved Zhao Mancha, his actions had taken only a few seconds and had been like the flow of water<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>smooth and without pause.</p>
 <p>The newcomer glanced at the two birds that had managed to dodge the two daggers. Then, he glanced at the Thunderbird who had already been called back by Wu Sen for protection. He gently placed the severely injured Zhao Mancha by Tang Xinyun’s side and then looked to the four shocked but grim looking people from the Beast Taming School with a cold expression.</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun had been flustered as she supported Zhao Mancha. Then, she took a deep breath after Zhao Mancha slightly shook her head to indicate that she was fine When she raised her head to look at the person in front of her, doubt appeared on her face. She didn’t recognize this person, but he seemed to be somewhat familiar.</p>
 <p>“Take aunty Zhao away first, I’ll deal with things here.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tang Xinyun’s expression turned blank as she heard the words of the newcomer in front of her. Her gaze fell on the red spear that was held by the newcomer.</p>
 <p>“You… you’re…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei furrowed his brows and interrupted her, “Don’t waste time! Go!”</p>
 <p>Zhao Mancha pressed her left hand on her right shoulder to begin the healing process of her injuries. Bai Yunfei had changed his appearance, but she had obviously recognized him. A light flashed through her eyes, as a thought popped up in her head for an instant. Then, she used her right hand to gently pull on Tang Xinyun to speak weakly, “Young miss, listen to him. We should leave quickly. Xiao Bai and I are injured, and your strength is far too weak. If we stay behind, it’ll only be even more dangerous for us. I have a feeling that he has a way to deal with these people…”</p>
 <p>After speaking, she couldn’t help but spit out another mouthful of blood, causing her face to turn deathly pale.</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun was alarmed, and she was unable to focus on so many things. She hastily supported aunty Zhao before giving a grateful look to Bai Yunfei. Then, she turned around and ran to the north at high-speed.</p>
 <p>Xiao Bai circled around Bai Yunfei’s head twice. Then, it caught up with Tang Xinyun and vigilantly guarded her.</p>
 <p>The two people and the bird gradually moved far away. However, the people from the Beast Taming School didn’t make any moves at all, which was unexpected. The four of them didn’t dare to relax at all. They recalled their soulbeasts and stared at Bai Yunfei intently.</p>
 <p>Wu Sen placed the shield in front of him, and there was even some cold sweat dripping from his forehead. That frightening explosion caused by the spear had simply terrified him — the sudden explosion of that immensely powerful elemental fire made him believe that this person was at least of the Soul Ancestor level of power.</p>
 <p><em>“Dammit! Why would a mid-stage Soul Ancestor suddenly appear here? No, from the strength of the elemental fire in that previous attack, it’s very possible for him to be at the late-stage Soul Ancestor level of power!”</em></p>
 <p>A drop of sweat slid off Wu Sen’s cheek. He was frantically thinking of ways to deal with this newcomer. From the first impression, he had determined that this person was at least of the Soul Ancestor level of power. He didn’t even dare to make any moves, much less use his soulsense in the event that he would anger the other party. Currently, he was temporarily too busy to even care about the escaping Tang Xinyun.</p>
 <p>Although he was a late-stage Soul Sprite that even possessed a low fifth-class Thunderbird, he didn’t have any confidence of winning a fight against this ‘Soul Ancestor,’ even with the help of his three companions. The Soul Sprite realm and the Soul Ancestor realm were two completely different realms, and he didn’t think that he had the power to jump across realms to kill his opponent. Even though he possessed the fifth-tier&nbsp;thunderbird, he still didn’t dare to fight against this opponent.</p>
 <p>Wu Sen didn’t move, and the other three who were weaker than him naturally didn’t move either. For a period of time, the spear-wielding Bai Yunfei was stuck in a deadlock with the four of them.</p>
 <p>When Tang Xinyun’s figure vanished into the distance, Bai Yunfei inwardly relaxed. As for Wu Sen, he gradually recovered from his initial shock and fear. After calming down, he started to feel that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>“Eh? Why hasn’t he moved yet?” Wu Sen started to become suspicious. He wouldn’t find it strange if Bai Yunfei had used his strength to suppress and humiliate everyone before leaving. He was even prepared to immediately start running for his life if Bai Yunfei wanted to kill them. Furthermore, attendant Li wouldn’t blame him too much if they failed their mission because of an expert like this.</p>
 <p>After the deadlock lasted for another thirty seconds, Wu Sen finally realized that he had made a mistake. He couldn’t help but carefully release his soulsense…</p>
 <p>The instant that Wu Sen’s soulsense swept over him, Bai Yunfei raised his brow. He knew that it wasn’t possible to continue this ruse any longer. Actually, the fact that his ruse achieved this much of an effect had already surpassed Bai Yunfei’s expectations. He was originally planning to create an opportunity for Tang Xinyun to escape by immediately attacking after he suddenly appeared. However, he didn’t think that the explosion created by the Fire-tipped Spear would intimidate his foes to such an extent like this. Thus, he assumed the manner of an expert to scare his foes. Now that Tang Xinyun had already escaped, being discovered wouldn’t matter to him. In any case, he wasn’t planning on being kind.</p>
 <p>He had killed once before and didn’t exactly care about killing again. In any case, his opponent wouldn’t let him leave this place alive. This had meant that the only option left was a battle to the death. <em>“Yes,”</em> he thought to himself. <em>“I’ll live and you’ll die.”</em></p>
 <p>After using his soulsense, Wu Sen was immediately stunned, “Mid-stage Soul Sprite? How can that be possible…”</p>
 <p>He released his soulsense again, and Bai Yunfei was still a mid-stage Soul Sprite. Again. It was still the same… could it be that he had hidden his true power?</p>
 <p>That had been Wu Sen’s first thought. However, he immediately pushed that thought out of his mind; If he had the ability to hide his strength so perfectly, why would he need to do so in the first place?</p>
 <p>When his gaze swept over the Fire-tipped Spear that was flickering with a fiery light, his eyes suddenly brightened, and a flash of understanding appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, he finally understood what had happened<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>he had been tricked.</p>
