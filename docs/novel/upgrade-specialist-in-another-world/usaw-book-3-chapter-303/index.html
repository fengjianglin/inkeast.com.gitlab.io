 <p>Chapter 303: Paying a Visit</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun turned to look at her mother in worry, “Mother… what… what should we do?”</p>
 <p>Both Chu Qingxue and Zhao Mancha were stunned into silence by Bai Yunfei’s sudden actions.</p>
 <p>“Sigh…” Chu Qingxue shook her head, “What an impulsive child… let’s go after him quickly. We mustn’t let anything happen to Yunfei.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t as though she couldn’t understand why Bai Yunfei was angry about their attempts to ‘compromise.’</p>
 <p>While she could understand Bai Yunfei’s anger, how in the world could Bai Yunfei understand the helpless situation they were in?</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei traveled to the lounge with a quickness like the wind. His expression was as dark as a storm. He was angry about the decisions of the three women. They were faced with humiliation and persecution from the Hua, yet they chose to apologize and compromise; that was something Bai Yunfei felt hard to accept.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t a man so impulsive that he’d let his emotions affect all of his decisions, but he knew that Chu Qingxue suffered. Despite not fully understanding the situation, Bai Yunfei would never allow Tang Xinyun ‘apologize’ to Hua Binbai. There was no way he’d let her accept such humiliation: absolutely not!</p>
 <p><em>“I may be an outsider and not understand what the Tang is like, but I can at the very least duke it out with the Hua!”</em></p>
 <p>With his speed, only three minutes were needed for him to arrive near the lounge of the Tang residence. Before he turned the corner, he could hear the sound of footsteps, so he started to slow down. Turning the corner with a calmer face than before, he was greeted by the sight of several people marching toward him in an aggressive manner.</p>
 <p>Eyeing the group, Bai Yunfei was able to pick one out of the entire crowd. A person bandaged up as heavily as a mummy.</p>
 <p>That person was, without a doubt, Hua Binbai.</p>
 <p>Noticing Bai Yunfei turn the corner, the men coming toward him started to slow down as well. They were surprised to see the unwelcome expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“It’s… it’s him! Brother, he’s the one that slut Tang Xinyun attacked me with!! He’s the one that hit me!” As soon as Bai Yunfei’s face registered in Hua Binbai’s eyes, he immediately raised a hand to point out Bai Yunfei. Since his teeth were missing, speaking was a little hard for him, but the hearing of everyone around him was good enough to make sense of what he was saying.</p>
 <p>The light in Bai Yunfei’s eyes was like daggers as he glared at Hua Binbai, “You men of Hua, I wasn’t quite sure what I just heard. Care to repeat that again?”</p>
 <p>“Yo—” Hua Binbai wanted to say something more, but when he met Bai Yunfei’s glare, he found himself unable to say anything else. His heart stopped beating for a moment, and his face grew a rosy-red, as if he was getting constipated.</p>
 <p>Of course, since he was wrapped up in so many bandages, no one could tell what was going on with him.</p>
 <p>“Arrogant brat!!” At that moment, a bulky-looking person walked over from Hua Binbai’s side. Glaring at the young man in front of him, he spat, “Are you the one who hurt my younger brother!?”</p>
 <p>This thick-browed man must’ve been the one Zhao Mancha referred to as Hua Chenshi, the older brother of Hua Binbai. The moment Hua Chenshi stepped forward, Bai Yunfei could tell that he wasn’t even bothering to hide his willingness to fight with how heavy his aura was getting.</p>
 <p><em>“Early-stage Soul Ancestor!”</em> Bai Yunfei remarked. Hua Binbai was only an early-stage Soul Sprite, so Bai Yunfei hadn’t expected his older brother would be that much stronger.</p>
 <p>“That’s right! I was the one who beat him, but with how rude he was being, it’s no wonder he found himself getting beaten up! So what, are you going to take his anger out on me in his stead?” Though Bai Yunfei was normally good-natured, the Bai Yunfei of right now was anything but that.</p>
 <p>“Very well, then! You’ve guts, brat! Men, break his legs!!” With a roar, a dozen guards immediately came forward to fulfill his command.</p>
 <p>“Stay your hand!” A deeper voice boomed from within the lounge. From there, a golden-robed man in his thirties walked out. He was on the skinnier side, his beard was pointed, and his eyes were as unfriendly as his stern lips. At a first glance, he’d give anyone the impression of being ‘cold-hearted.’</p>
 <p>Right behind him was Tang Yongzhong, the head housekeeper.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn’t one to judge appearances, but even he found himself filled with loathing for this person.</p>
 <p>Sparing a glance at Bai Yunfei, the man then spoke to Hua Chenshi, “Brother Chenshi, please do not spill any unnecessary blood on the grounds of the Tang. Please take your business outside, else I will find it hard to explain myself to father.”</p>
 <p>“Second brother, what do you mean by this?” Just then, an even gentler voice asked a question. This time, it was Tang Xinyun who appeared by Bai Yunfei’s side. “Second brother,” she said to the unfriendly-looking man, “Yunfei is a guest of our home, how could you treat him this way!?”</p>
 <p>This unkindly-looking person was the second brother of Tang Xinyun, Tang Zhi, a late-stage Soul Sprite.</p>
 <p>Somewhat surprised by her sudden outburst, Tang Zhi looked at Zhao Mancha and Chu Qingxue, who only just arrived behind Tang Xinyun, “Tang Xinyun, you know that I’m your older brother. How dare you speak to me that way!? The man you brought home injured Hua Binbai severely, you can’t escape your responsibility! The Hua are good friends with us Tang, yet you pull something like this when you come home. Are you mad!? Are you trying to destroy the friendship between our two families!?”</p>
 <p>“I… I didn’t mean to…” Cowed by the intimidating scolding of her older brother, Tang Xinyun’s face drastically whitened. For a good while, she didn’t say anything else. She bit her lower lip, troubled.</p>
 <p>The knot in Chu Qingxue’s eyes grew slightly thicker as she prepared to speak, but it was Bai Yunfei who beat her to the punch. “What a groundless accusation! Are you just going to listen to Hua Binbai’s one-sided story to make your decision!?”</p>
 <p>Tang Zhi chose to throw his lot with the Hua to focus on Tang Xinyun. This, to Bai Yunfei, felt extremely wrong. They were brother and sister of the same father. It was utterly incomprehensible to Bai Yunfei why Tang Zhi would choose to make life difficult for Tang Xinyun.</p>
 <p>“That is right! The Tang will believe in master Hua’s words!” Without even skipping a beat, Tang Zhi unreasonably started to confirm what Bai Yunfei had said, “As an outsider, you should resign yourself to your punishment for harming another! And Tang Xinyun should offer up an apology!”</p>
 <p>“An apology!? You’re making your own sister offer up an apology to the one who spoke so rudely to her in the first place!?” Bai Yunfei sarcastically snapped, “Second master Tang, I’d like to ask you something. Do your words represent the entirety of the Tang?”</p>
 <p>Tang Yongzhong spoke then, as if reluctant to have Tang Zhi answer that question, “Young master, I—”</p>
 <p>“Stay your tongue, I act well within my rights! With father gone, the Tang is up to me to manage!” Tang Zhi boomed to Tang Yongzhong before turning back to Bai Yunfei, “That is correct! I speak on behalf of the Tang, and the Tang says that Tang Xinyun should apologize!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Alright then! What a great family the Tang are!” Tang Zhi’s answer forced a laugh from Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Only now did Bai Yunfei realize just what kind of treatment Tang Xinyun had faced at the hands of her own family. If Tang Zhi could speak about her in such a manner while speaking on behalf of the Tang, that meant there’d be no repercussion for him since the others felt the same way.</p>
 <p>With a hand to stop Chu Qingxue from speaking, Bai Yunfei continued to say, “Fine then! I was the one who hurt Hua Binbai! Their grievances are with me! If you want to deal with me, then bring it on! If you’re a soul cultivator, then by all means use your strength to prove yourself to me!”</p>
 <p>A clamor started to rise among the crowd. Did Bai Yunfei really mean he would fight an entire family by himself!?</p>
 <p>“Haha, what an ignorant brat you are! Don’t think that you can act as arrogant as you like just because you defeated my younger brother in such an underhanded manner! Men! Capture and bring him back to our home!” Hua Chenshi nodded at Tang Zhi for confirmation before commanding his men to arrest Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“That… that Bai Yunfei, why is he so reckless!? He might be strong, but does he really think he can fight off the Hua…?” Zhao Mancha uttered with disbelief and wide-open eyes.</p>
 <p>“Hold on!” Zhao Mancha suddenly realized something, “His strength… what’s wrong with him!? He was a mid-stage Soul Sprite before, so why is he a late-stage Soul Warrior right now!?”</p>
 <p>She whirled to Tang Xinyun, “And young miss! You… why are you still a late-stage Soul Warrior!? It’s been a year since you joined the Crafting School! You should be a Soul Sprite by now! What in the world happened!?”</p>
 <p>“Aunty Zhao, it’s a little complicated,” Tang Xinyun sighed. “A lot of things happened to us, but I can explain everything at another time…”</p>
 <p>Chu Qingxue continued to watch as the Hua family started to close in on Bai Yunfei, “Xinyun, why do you look as if you’re not worried about Yunfei?”</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun smiled gently before turning to look at the very calm-looking Bai Yunfei, “Mother, don’t worry. If it's these people, they won’t be able to even hurt Yunfei…”</p>
