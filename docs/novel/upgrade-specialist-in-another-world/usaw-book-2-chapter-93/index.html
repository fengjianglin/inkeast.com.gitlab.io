 <p>Chapter 93: Jing Mingfeng, 'No Discord, No Concord'</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>When that man’s fist collided with the brick, Bai Yunfei was sent staggering back half a step while the other was sent even farther away with a stunned look. Bai Yunfei had done nothing but stand there instead of pursuing. He knew that the man had wanted to take advantage of the crowd to escape and so he stood guard at the alleyway entrance. If he wanted to escape the other way, then the man would have to run quite far. Bai Yunfei had full confidence that he could chase him if he did retreat the other way though. With both walls being extremely tall, Bai Yunfei would be able to stop him if the man tried to climb them.</p>
 <p>“A br-brick??” The man shook his right hand as he looked at the item in Bai Yunfei’s hand. He couldn’t help but let out a light inhale. With a queer expression, the man’s eyes looked at the brick in Bai Yunfei’s hand before immediately growing angry, “Kid, what are you playing at? We are both soul cultivators, so show some face, won’t you? Did you really want to have me captured and sent to prison? The city council is willing to accept the case of any one soul cultivator, do you think that? If you’re going to disturb the lord mayor, then that won’t do you any good. You’ve taken back your space ring, so don’t say you suffered any damages. Or do you mean to say you want to kill me to seal the deal!”</p>
 <p>“If I wanted to kill you, you would already be spitting blood then.” Bai Yunfei stared the man down. “I didn’t think that a soul cultivator at the stage of a Soul Sprite would lower himself to stealing, I have learned a lot. I’ll let you go, but you’ll need to promise me one thing.”</p>
 <p>“Say it!” Knowing that he was in dire straits, the man spoke with clenched teeth.</p>
 <p>There was a faint smile on Bai Yunfei’s face, “I am quite interested in that transformation ability of yours. To be able conceal your soulforce to the level of a regular person is odd, but you are also capable of perfectly changing your facial appearances. Is that a soul skill? Hand over those two techniques, and I’ll let you go.”</p>
 <p>“What?” The man’s eyes grew wide as he stared at Bai Yunfei with an incredulous look. But then his wide open eyes began to grow furious. Then, his face began to twitch so much that his body began to shake. With a loathing glare at Bai Yunfei, the man snapped, “You want the secrets of my family as well! You’re just the same as the others….people like you, you’ve killed my entire family for them! I can’t even be let off! Don’t think that you’ll gain anything from my body….drop dead instead!”</p>
 <p>His eyes could nearly spit fire, and his words were nearly incoherent. His teeth gnashed against each other with a low growl escaping them before charging at Bai Yunfei as if he had gone mad!</p>
 <p>The azure light around his body began to quicken even faster than before. At the same time of his charge, his right hand gave a twist to allow for a black-colored dagger to appear in it. Charging at Bai Yunfei, he stabbed outwards!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had been stunned. He didn’t know that the enemy would suddenly become so berserk like that. However, when he saw the scarlet-red eyes of the man, Bai Yunfei’s heart had trembled for a moment. Those eyes--Bai Yunfei was all too familiar with it. Back when Li Chengfeng had nurtured a hatred for the mountain bandits, he too had a similar expression. This was a hatred that permeated the bones and all the way into the very soul!</p>
 <p>In his distraction, the dagger of his opponent had already drew close to him. Eyes flashing, Bai Yunfei took a step back and dodged the stab. He had not attacked back and instead took several steps to the left. But what he didn’t expect was to see his enemy give up on his balance or even defenses. With a toss of the dagger, it felt into his left hand before relentlessly stabbing at Bai Yunfei’s abdomen!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows flew up, but his feet did not stop moving. While his body had slanted to the side like a tilting doll, the brick in his hand flew out to stop the enemy’s left hand. Afterwards, he gave a single spin to slam the brick onto the other shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” Following a slight sound, the person’s body had suddenly been sent flying back without warning--this was the sign of the “Hurtling” effect being activated.</p>
 <p>The man flew several meters away before coming to a tumble on the ground with a dazed expression. Bai Yunfei did not chase him and instead took the time to shout out, “Hey! I say, don’t you have the wrong person here? I only said a single phrase, and you reacted in such a huge manner?”</p>
 <p>Still dazed, the man raised his head up to look at Bai Yunfei. His eyebrows raised up as if his mind had been cleared. The look in his eyes had returned to normal as well. Finally, he let out a slight exhale and spoke quietly to himself, “That was close, I lost control at a single phrase? It’s lucky that he wasn’t an actual enemy, or else….No. I have to learn to suppress my hatred. Jing Mingfeng, when you become strong enough, you can’t be as impulsive as this again….”</p>
 <p>After recovering himself, Jing Mingfeng waved his hand to recollect his dagger. Looking at Bai Yunfei, he scratched his head in embarrassment. As if speaking to a good friend, he said, “Well….that was my bad. I lost control of myself. Little brother, my mind isn’t all-too-clear at the moment. I’ll go find myself a doctor. So, with that said, I won’t disturb you anymore, goodbye then.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned around to walk out from the other entrance of the alley as if all was right in the world.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had been gobsmacked. His mouth twitched in confusion if he should laugh or cry before shouting out, “Hey! Did you think you could get away that easily? You still owe me for trying to steal my space ring!”</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng’s foot stopped mid step. With an internal sigh to himself, he turned around helplessly. “Then what do you think should happen?”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean what I think should happen? I didn’t think anything should happen, okay?” Bai Yunfei spoke. His voice had seemed relaxed, and for some reason, he suddenly didn’t feel anymore hatred for this man. Instead, he had felt a feeling of camaraderie. There was even a notion of ‘this man isn’t bad’ in his mind. Perhaps….it was from that hate-filled stare earlier, or that barely suppressed amount of sorrow in his eyes….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei looked at the dismayed Jing Mingfeng for a moment before suddenly breaking out into a strange smile. Feeling a chill in the back of his spine, Jing Mingfeng took a step back in warning, “Wha-what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Haha….” Bai Yunfei chuckled as he weighed the brick in his hand. “If it weren’t for the fact that I had a special method to find you, then I would have lost my space ring to you. That would be rather disastrous to me. If I let you go just like this, then I won’t feel at rest with myself. Let us fight for two more bouts!”</p>
 <p>Having said that, Bai Yunfei didn’t even wait for the man to react before his figure flickered away into a mirror image. In the blink of an eye, he had already reached Jing Mingfeng’s front and swung the brick down onto his chest.</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng had been greatly startled before hurriedly dodging to the side. But Bai Yunfei had predicted that Jing Mingfeng would dodge and twisted his hand to slam the brick into Jing Mingfeng’s chest. The man had only stumbled backwards a bit; there was no damage, and nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
 <p>“Hey! What are you doing! What kind of soul cultivator uses a brick to fight!” Jing Mingfeng took several hasty steps backwards while shouting at Bai Yunfei who had seemed to ignore him. Although his opponent was a soul cultivator who was extremely fast due to his wind property, Bai Yunfei was a level higher than him and had the Wave Treading Steps. There was nowhere to run but into the brick walls.</p>
 <p>“I’m saying you….” Jing Mingfeng lifted his hand to block the third attempt when all of a sudden he was sent flying once more. This had ceased his speech, but he had not flown far away because of the wall behind him….</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng had stood up to dust himself off. There were no visible damages, but he had stared at the brick in Bai Yunfei’s hand in utter confusion--what in the world had happened just then?</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei chuckled before charging forward once more.</p>
 <p>Because the battle between these two people had taken place in a rather isolated alleyway. All that could be heard were several bangs along with the indescribable grunting sound of a person.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng’s entire body was filled with dirt and grime from where he stood. Cut into a sorry position,his originally white wig had fallen off a long time ago and revealed the black hair underneath. With the original crease marks of an elder still on his forehead, he looked quite grotesque.</p>
 <p>Rolling like a donkey to avoid the next blow, he scrambled back with a shout, “Hey! Enough’s enough! I’ve already been sent flying seven times for who knows why, I’m going to get really angry if we repeat this again!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei came to a stop as he looked at the brick in his hands with confusion, “Oh? Seven times already? Well fine then….”</p>
 <p>Jing Mingfeng let out a sigh in relief. Just as he was about to say something, Bai Yunfei had beaten him to the punch. “Then one more round, gather up your luck!”</p>
 <p>“I….”Jing Mingfeng didn’t even have time to let out a roar of grievance before the brick had slammed into his shoulder. Nothing. The brick slammed into his shoulder again--causing his face to grow dark once more as he realized it was too late to dodge….and then he was sent flying away as if it was his wish.</p>
 <p>After tumbling and picking himself off the ground, Jing Mingfeng saw that Bai Yunfei had made no more attempt to chase him. Not willing to stay here any longer, Jing Mingfeng turned around from him to run--who knows whether or not this opponent would drag it out with another phrase of “gather your luck”....</p>
 <p>“Hey! Our debts are settled now, I won’t hit you anymore. My name is Bai Yunfei, what’s your name?”</p>
 <p>And then the smiling figure of Bai Yunfei could be heard shouting out from behind him. Jing Mingfeng had ceased in his moments for just a second. But instead of turning back, he redoubled his efforts to run out from the alley. As soon as he turned the corner, a sullen but furious roar could be heard from Jing Mingfeng.</p>
 <p>“Our debts are settled my ass! Kid, I, Jing Mingfeng will remember this! I was humiliated by you today, but wait for me to get my revenge!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had started for a moment, his lips twitching in response, “I only hit you a few times with a brick. It’s not like you were injured or anything, how petty….”</p>
