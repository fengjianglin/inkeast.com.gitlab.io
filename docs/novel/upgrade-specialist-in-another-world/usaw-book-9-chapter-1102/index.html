<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Core World. Within his own room in Yao City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei sat on top of his own bed with his eyes closed. His body was enveloped by a thin layer of red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Phew…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slow drawn out breath escaped from Bai Yunfei as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Qi wasn’t the only one to get stronger, I can feel myself getting stronger as well. Maybe the two of us will become Soul Emperor together, or at least help each in that regard…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As per usual, Bai Yunfei was thinking to himself as he gripped his right hand in front of him. He was testing out his own strength and feeling the power course through his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half a day ago marked the time when Xiao Qi killed the Wind Ape King, Golden Roc King, and Duan Tianqing before going into isolation to meditate. The amount of experience he got for killing those three transferred over to Bai Yunfei due to their bond, so he could feel the increase in strength from both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like Xiao Qi, Long Lan was hiding away to absorb the energy in both soulgems. Bai Yunfei reckoned that the two would be enough for him to become a late-stage class seven soulbeast. For a class seven soulbeast to have the chance to use the soulgems of a class eight soulbeast…Long Lan was probably the first ‘beast’ to do so in the last millennia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other participants in the battle were all sleeping off their fatigue. With no one else there to disturb him, Bai Yunfei was free to rest up for half the day and recover his entire strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure the ‘allies’ of the wolf clan will be here soon, I wonder how many powerful individuals they’ll have? Will they accept my plan, I wonder…”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Bai Yunfei thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should probably be able to get their support. It’s practically what every soulbeast for the last thousands of years desired after all…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll probably be staying here for a few more days. That’s fine. There’s a lot of things I want to check out, and there’s still the Yao clan’s ‘research’. If we can make a break through on that we should be able to gain even more support from the soulbeasts…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spoils of war were humongous this time around. The class seven soulbeast didn’t have any soul armaments on their bodies—as expected—but the beast tamers had quite the amount on them, Duan Tianqing especially. From him, Bai Yunfei managed to loot a high-heaven tiered piece of armor. Upgrading it would come later.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei didn’t bother to look at the contents of his space rings, he’d have time for that in the future. The first thing he wanted to focus on were the possessions of the Golden Roc King and Wind Ape King. From them, Bai Yunfei saw that they had plenty of natural resources that could be used for crafting. While he desperately wanted to take a closer look at them, Bai Yunfei decided to categorize them away for later when he had the time to craft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a type of ‘research’ Bai Yunfei had with the Yao clan that had to do with the ‘soulbeast puppets’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were trying to figure out a way to undo the seals on a soulbeast puppet!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a groundbreaking piece of research!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The methodology of the Beast Taming School involved placing a slave seal on their soulbeast puppets. No one in recorded history had ever successfully undone the seal in the last several thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Yao clan were trailblazers in their art and had plenty of experience in dealing with the soul of a soulbeast. By using the familiar pills as a basis, the Yao clan could attempt to craft a new pill that would potentially reawaken the sentience of a soulbeast puppet and undo the slave seal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a grand goal, but not an unreachable one. It was only a matter of time before the clan would grab hold of a plausible lead and finish their work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei was in the middle of thinking about this research when something from the outside world alerted him. Opening his eyes, Bai Yunfei activated the Core Stone and disappeared from the Core World.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the outside world. In a stone cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei appeared within the cave and placed the Core Stone within his robes at once. Standing in front of him was the Bloodhowl Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are all ready to leave now, Bai Yunfei.” The wolf king nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Bai Yunfei nodded back and walked closer to the Bloodhowl Wolf King who waved his hand. A ripple of energy gathered around them before the two were whisked away to another area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They reappeared somewhere else in the world. Standing in the sky, the Bloodhowl Wolf King raised his hand to point in a specific direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In about fifteen hundred kilometers in that direction is the Golden Roc King’s abode.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei glanced in the direction the Bloodhowl Wolf King pointed at with a quirked eyebrow. Nodding, he waited for the Bloodhowl Wolf King to teleport the two of them to their destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that the battle was over and their enemies dead, Bai Yunfei and the Bloodhowl Wolf King were coming over to collect the second half of their spoils. The spoils that could be collected at the Golden Roc King and Wind Ape King’s homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As class eight soulbeasts, it went without saying that their homes would be filled with precious treasures. Bai Yunfei doubted that the two of them would have any high-grade soul skills or soul armaments, but the resources the two soulbeasts had would definitely make up for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the territories of both the Golden Roc King and Wind Ape King were far away, Bai Yunfei opted to have the Bloodhowl Wolf King teleport the two of them to their destinations. It was the most efficient and fastest way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the home of the Golden Roc King was filled with many precious treasures and high-grade primal stones. As pleased as he could be, Bai Yunfei happily took stock of the ingredients and materials. He even allocated a few of them for the Yao clan to use for their own pills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After cleaning out the Golden Roc King’s cave, Bai Yunfei and the Bloodhowl Wolf King teleported to the Wind Ape King’s cave straight after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wind Ape King lived in the belly of a mountain whose contents were filled with the treasures taken from others. This was the place the Wind Ape King secured all the goods he got over the years he lived. And now, Bai Yunfei and the Bloodhowl Wolf King were here to clean it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was with suspicion that Bai Yunfei entered the main room, his eyes focusing on an object to their right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was…a bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A stone bed roughly five meters long, thee meters wide, and one meter tall and had a fur blanket draped over it. This had to be the bed the Wind Ape King used to sleep or meditate on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei wasn’t the only suspicious one. The Bloodhowl Wolf King was looking at the bed strangely too. He could sense a strange aura coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together, the two walked up to the bed and placed their hands on it. The moment his hand touched the bed, the Bloodhowl Wolf King looked at it in shock!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” He began to say after a moment of silence, “this bed…is a tool to help one cultivate!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a simple reason why he was able to make that statement. The moment the Bloodhowl Wolf King touched the bed, he felt his soulforce start to circulate even faster around his body!! In other words, this bed was able to make one cultivate at an even faster rate than usual!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then this…bed has the same effect as the legendary Nephrite Throne!! Since when the Wind Ape King obtain something like this?”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The Bloodhowl Wolf King wondered to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s no wonder he became so strong so quickly, he had something like this helping him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? What are you doing, Bai Yunfei?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bloodhowl Wolf King’s head shot up in alarm when he noticed Bai Yunfei was up to something strange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Yunfei was sending his soulforce into the bed for some reason! It started with Bai Yunfei drawing his hand back before slamming a soulforce-infused palm onto its surface!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It happened so fast that the Bloodhowl Wolf King hadn’t even the time to stop him.&nbsp;</span></p>
