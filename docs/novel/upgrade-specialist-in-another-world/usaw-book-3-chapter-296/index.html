 <p>Chapter 296: Attacking the Enemy Together</p>
 <p>“Fourth brother!”</p>
 <p>Never Die’s eyes had nearly leaped out of his sockets when he saw Bai Yunfei kill yet another one of his brothers. He swung his sword at Han Chong, who had thrown yet another one of his lightning-bolt-shaped daggers, and drew blood from Han Chong’s left shoulder. Despite that, Never Die didn’t bother to attack Han Chong again. Instead, he shot straight for Bai Yunfei with the speed of a newly-launched arrow!</p>
 <p>“Die! I’ll bury you with my brothers!!” Snarling, Never Die swung his sword down to deliver a tremendous wave of energy in the direction of Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t really care just how deep the familial ties of the Four Death Gods went. Tang Xinyun had called them criminals with crimes so heavy death wouldn’t be enough to wipe the slate clean.</p>
 <p>“Hah, so even you can feel grief? When you killed people before, did you ever think about their family members!?” Bai Yunfei sneered. Twirling his spear, Bai Yunfei threw the body of Go Die onto the ground. Commanding the Cataclysmic Seal, Bai Yunfei erected a barrier around him to stop the wave of energy coming at him.</p>
 <p>The next moment, the energy wave collided with the barrier, causing the surrounding area to blow up.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was left unharmed in his barrier.</p>
 <p>A flash of light danced across Bai Yunfei’s eyes. Never Die was angrier than ever with the death of his brothers, but the power behind his attacks was clearly much weaker than before.</p>
 <p>“You’re at the end of your rope…” Bai Yunfei sighed. With a wave of his left hand, the Crescent Moon Blade started to vibrate. From the other side, the other pair behind Never Die started to exude a chilling aura as it spun. In a single fluid motion, it shot straight for Never Die’s back.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Cataclysmic Seal let loose a burst of fire before traveling toward Never Die’s chest with the Crescent Moon Blade.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei never would’ve fought a head-on battle with Never Die if the man had been at his peak strength. He had once experienced the taste of power that a late-stage Soul Ancestor possessed, back during his time in Curopia City.</p>
 <p>As things were, Never Die was at the very most at fifty percent of his optimal strength. Han Chong and Han Lin were at hand as well, so Bai Yunfei could take it easy. Of course, he didn’t think about having a close-combat battle just yet. The Crescent Moon Blade and the Cataclysmic Seal would do their job as long-range weapons and would protect him from attacks.</p>
 <p>“Clank!!”</p>
 <p>Moving his sword in front, Never Die managed to knock away the spinning Crescent Moon Blade before moving to the side. Though he tried to dodge the Cataclysmic Seal, it managed to graze his left shoulder.</p>
 <p>There was a cracking sound from his bones before he grunted in pain, but it wasn’t enough for him to stop his advance toward Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>Before he could get far, a shot of violet light came from behind Bai Yunfei; Han Lin was providing support for him with one of his lightning bolt daggers. Never Die inched to the side so that the dagger would only strike his abdomen. Despite the wound, a flash of blue light was all it took for it to heal!</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!” The second Crescent Moon Blade came flying back. It was being manipulated by Bai Yunfei. He was attempting to slice through Never Die’s throat with the blade while the Cataclysmic Seal looped around to strike the back of his head.</p>
 <p>This time, Never Die had no other choice but to stop. He threw himself off to the side so that both soul armaments missed him.</p>
 <p>The soul armaments flew around, and made yet another attempt to strike Never Die down.</p>
 <p>“Clank! Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>With his sword, Never Die managed to block the Cataclysmic Seal while allowing the Crescent Moon Blade to cut deep enough into his body to see bone. However, the wound healed up as fast as it was delivered.</p>
 <p>However—</p>
 <p>There was a difference this time.</p>
 <p>The recovery rate of the wound was noticeably slower than before.</p>
 <p>Bit by bit, Bai Yunfei was gaining control of the tempo of the battle. The Crescent Moon Blade still in his left hand was being waved gently like a conductor’s wand as it controlled how the other Crescent Moon Blade moved. At the same time, he was controlling the Cataclysmic Seal, but controlling both objects at the same time wasn’t too difficult a task for him. He was used to micromanaging many different materials when crafting equipment after all.</p>
 <p>One after another, the two soul armaments continued to harass Never Die, who either dodged or parried the two. Soon Never Die managed to get within thirty meters of Bai Yunfei before he found himself unable to get any closer.</p>
 <p>Yet another serious blow was delivered to him in the form of a cut from the Crescent Moon Blade. The Cataclysmic Seal was again blocked, but what prevented him from going even further was the reintroduction of Han Chong and Han Lin!!</p>
 <p>Never Die found himself reevaluating Bai Yunfei because of how nimble and troublesome the Cataclysmic Seal and Crescent Moon Blades were. Not only was Bai Yunfei a huge problem, he was a problem he couldn’t get away from.</p>
 <p>Han Chong and Han Lin were already enough to overwhelm the three brothers. With Bai Yunfei here and his other two brothers dead, things were extremely dire now. If he hadn’t lost himself to his anger and tried to attack Bai Yunfei, he could’ve escaped with his life if he tried.</p>
 <p>But it was too late to escape now.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Once more, the Cataclysmic Seal slammed against Never Die’s sword and forced the man back two steps. Having been knocked into the path of the Crescent Moon Blade, Never Die was just about to move when, all of a sudden, his face blanched in surprise!!</p>
 <p>A flash of red light burst from the Cataclysmic Seal, giving birth to a string of flames! The coil of flames stretched past his blade and coiled around his arm before tightening onto it!!</p>
 <p>+10 additional effect; the Flame Twister, activated!!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>

 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p>With the fire spreading around him, Never Die immediately tried to counter the fire with a burst of elemental water from his body. In the five elements, water subdued fire, so according to logic, the strands of fire around him should’ve been dispelled.</p>
 <p>To his shock, the fire didn’t even weaken by a single degree!!</p>
 <p>And furthermore...</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!!”</p>
 <p>A gleam of metal flashed into view as the Crescent Moon Blade left a deep cut in his right shoulder. According to his usual speed, dodging the Crescent Moon Blade at that speed should’ve been more than doable!!</p>
 <p><em>“I’m… slower now!!”</em> That single thought flashed across Never Die’s mind. He knew something was wrong with his body; it was most likely because of the strange fire wrapped around his arm, but… how could it have such an effect!?</p>
 <p>From far away, Han Chong sensed that the movements of Never Die were irregular. Seeing his chance, Han Chong cried out, “Han Lin, flicker!”</p>
 <p>From ten meters to the left, Han Lin immediately tossed the dagger in his hand. Concentrating, he took out a flying dagger that was shaped like the wing of a cicada. It was half an inch wide and three inches long with a metal that was almost transparent. Han Lin tossed the flying dagger with no hesitation!</p>
 <p>At the same time, an identical-shaped dagger was thrown by Han Chong.</p>
 <p>The daggers were thrown with absolute swiftness, but no sound came forth. As soon as the daggers left the hands of their owners, they simply… disappeared!!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei raised an eyebrow in curiosity. When the two daggers disappeared, he felt the slightest feeling to turn toward Never Die.</p>
 <p>From the other side, Never Die was paying close attention when the two brothers threw their daggers. He had been planning on using the trajectory and speed of the daggers to predict when and where to dodge, but the daggers had disappeared!</p>
 <p>“Wha—” Almost unable to even think about what was happening, Never Die could only see was two flashes of green light right in front of him. Like apparitions, the two daggers suddenly appeared without warning; one was aimed at his heart, the other at his throat!!</p>
 <p>Eyes dilating in shock, Never Die leaned his head to the side to dodge one of the daggers and let it fly past his throat. The dagger nicked him in the neck and just barely missed a major artery!</p>
 <p>“Pfttt!!”</p>
 <p>He failed to dodge the other dagger because he was so focused on dodging the dagger flying toward his neck. As a result, the dagger shot through his chest and exited out of his back. Paling in the face, Never Die felt his lifeforce start to slip away. A flash of blue light started to glow from where the hole was in his body. The more Never Die concentrated, the more the elemental water started to materialize around his wound, treating the near-fatal wound.</p>
 <p>In no time at all, the wound started to heal, leaving Never Die with a thoroughly sweaty body from the healing effort.</p>
 <p>Before he could start feeling happy, yet another event immediately caused him to grow shocked!</p>
 <p>Yet another ring of fire with a spear right through its center was about to stab him straight through the chest!!</p>
 <p>The confusion of Never Die served as an opportunity for Bai Yunfei to strike. Traveling fast with the Wave Treading Steps, Bai Yunfei made use of when Never Die was healing to unleash a strike with the Threefold Stab!!</p>
 <p>Unable to dodge, all Never Die could do was try to bring his sword up and hope that he’d be able to make it in time to block.</p>
 <p>“Bakiin!!”</p>
 <p>The Fire-tipped Spear stabbed straight through the blade and continued to stab into Never Die’s flesh. Never Die fell just slightly as he tried to retreat, but then...</p>
 <p>“Boom!!”</p>
 <p>In front of his very eyes, Never Die watched the ring of elemental fire on the spear suddenly explode. The sword in his hand shattered into many differing sized fragments, reducing his chest to a mangled mess!</p>
 <p>The +10 effect of the Fire-tipped Spear, activated!</p>
 <p>The explosive force of the explosion forced Never Die off his feet and into the air. As he flew, a spray of blood escaped his mouth. His eyes were wide with shock, and the elemental water in his body was trying its best to heal his wounds as fast as possible, but the wounds this time were far too severe. The wounds—while still healing relatively fast—no longer healed instantaneously like before.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” The sound of something else made its way into Never Die’s ears, causing him to feel surprised again. Looking to the source, he saw Bai Yunfei suddenly leap into the air right above where he was. The Fire-tipped Spear was gone from his hands, but in its place, a flaming blade about two meters long traveled down the length of his arm before cleaving into Never Die!</p>
 <p>His weapon was already broken, his body airborne, and his wounds not yet healed—how could he possibly dodge this?</p>
 <p>“Noooo!!!”</p>
 <p>Despair flooded Never Die’s eyes as he let loose the very last cry of regret he’d ever voice in his life. The weakening blue glow of light in his chest was soon engulfed by the flames of fire…</p>
