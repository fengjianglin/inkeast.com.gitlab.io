 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

You’d best be on your best behavior. If anything else happens, I’ll break your legs to go with your arms!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye—yes…..your grandson will listen obediently…”</span></p>

In ordinary times, there’ll be a few youngsters coming and going, but if sire needs a place to stay, there will definitely be no one to bother you here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By his side was an elderly man in gray robes. He had a dull expression on his face, but his eyes were chillingly dark enough to have even a mid-stage Soul King like Cheng Chaochuan give him the polite treatment. In other words, this man was by no means weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder nodded his head, “I won’t be here in the Capital for long.

We are only just waiting for the best possible moment to ensure nothing goes wrong. Due to the importance of this matter and the fate of our entire Cheng, we must do all that we can to be careful. And so, let us please confer over a few crucial details….</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That...scared me,” Li Chen patted his chest, “no wonder he’s a Soul King if he can scare us out of our minds with just a few words. Lord Cheng, what is your grandfather doing here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cheng Xin shrugged his shoulders, “How should I know? It’s a good thing we finished as soon as we did, otherwise my grandfather would’ve heard what we were talking about. Let’s go home, we can’t let anyone find out about this. We meet again in two days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are...are we still going to go through with this plan?” Zhu Yizhi asked timidly, “Your grandfather said to behave ourselves. What if he already knows about our plans? If we go through with this, what if….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! Watch what you’re saying!” Cheng Xin glared at him, “Don’t make me look down on you, little Zhi. Are you afraid? I’ve heard my grandfather say those words so many times already, and even if I did get into trouble after that, he only scolds me at most. I’m not afraid, are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“N—no! I’ll do as you say, lord Xin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Continuing to walk into the Capital, Li Chen suddenly spoke up, “Lord Xin, I heard that….Xu Sihan has had some trouble with Bai Yunfei before. Do you think we should rope him in? If by chance we get caught, we’d have one more person to help us. And if anything….we could use him as our scapegoat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zeng Fei and Zhu Yizhi both lit up at that suggestion, “That’s a good idea! That Xu Sihan is a pretty stupid one. If we say just a few words to him, we can probably use him to our advantage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Cheng Xin quirked his lips, “Did it really take you all this long to think about that? I asked Xu Sihan to come earlier today, but he wimped out saying he didn’t want to anger Bai Yunfei any more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah? You already went looking for him, lord Xin?” Li Chen spoke, crestfallen. “Is that Xu Sihan that cowardly, what a loser! He might be the son of a minister like lord Xin, but his actions and personality aren’t even a tenth of what lord Xin is!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Xu have always been a cowardly house. They can’t beat my family, so they choose to retreat inwardly. Sooner or later, there’ll only be one senior minister in the entire empire, the Cheng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; …………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei took Tang Xinyun and the others back to his residence. Having the servants draw up a room for the three travel-weary females, Bai Yunfei was ready to let them retire early for the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even speak more than a few words with Tang Xinyun, and the thick-faced Zheng Kai didn’t have the chance to speak with Kou Tingting either. Rather than giving up, he rounded on Bai Yunfei to ask him a few questions about her. Bai Yunfei was willing to answer only a few questions before he got tired of it all and slammed the door shut on Zheng Kai’s face, much to the cursing of his friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei shook his head as he listened Zheng Kai order one of the servants to draw up a room for him. As good as a friend Bai Yunfei felt Zheng Kai was, he still couldn’t shake off the negative ‘reputation’ he had. Even worse, with how recent his latest escapades with several women were, Bai Yunfei wasn’t feeling confident in helping Zheng Kai pursue Kou Tingting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The emotions of Zheng Kai today was a rare one, admittedly. Bai Yunfei didn’t even know if he should treat Zheng Kai seriously or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Either way, Bai Yunfei couldn’t exactly forbid Zheng Kai from pursuing Tingting, even if the two were a well match for one another. It was Zheng Kai’s personal choice, and Bai Yunfei didn’t care much as long as he wasn’t being used as an ‘accomplice’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The days following that night were considerably far better than usual in Bai Yunfei’s opinion. With Tang Xinyun here, it was like the world had gotten a lot brighter than before with the rekindled flames of emotion from not seeing Tang Xinyun in a long time fueling that light. Just being able to wake up in the morning and feeling the aura of her being close by filled Bai Yunfei with a great deal of happiness from morning to evening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being new to the Capital, Tang Xinyun was extremely curious on how the city was. Together with Bai Yunfei, the two of them roamed around the Capital from one place to the next. One day, they’d explore the academy, another day, the northern parts of the Capital, and then the day after, the eastern parts….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the course of these days, there was an uninvited ‘host’ who seemed to take it upon himself to lead the ‘tour’ around the Capital. Taking them from west to east and south to north, this person was so excited to lead them that it felt like he was taking some drugs to keep up his energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That person was Zheng Kai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of his time was spent paying extra attention to Kou Tingting almost. Unfortunately for him, Kou Tingting felt neither grateful nor wanted his attention and hardly gave him the opportunity to be alone with her to say a word or two. If not for Zheng Kai knowing when to back off when he did, Kou Tingting would’ve most likely had an even worse opinion of him.</span></p>

Perhaps it was because of his good mood, but his body felt better than usual for the next few days. The feeling of weakness was gone for the most part. In fact, Bai Yunfei felt like he was back to the levels of strength before his match with Cheng Yao. There also didn’t seem to be a chance of him losing control of his emotions again as badly as just a few days ago.</span></p>

With Tang Xinyun and Kou Tingting deciding to take the younger one back to Bai Yunfei’s place, Bai Yunfei decided to go to the Soothing Heart himself to have a pot of Soul Consolidating Tea.</span></p>
