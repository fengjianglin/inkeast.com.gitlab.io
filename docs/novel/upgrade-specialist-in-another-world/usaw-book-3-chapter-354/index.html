 <p>Chapter 354: When All Worries Melt Away</p>
 <p>With her hands now resting on her knees, Tang Xinyun turned to look at Bai Yunfei, “Yunfei, how are… your two essence fireseeds? Did senior Zi Jin say anything about them?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, there’s no problems, so don’t worry about them.” Bai Yunfei replied.</p>
 <p>“Master even said that this was an extremely fortunate stroke of luck for me!”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Tang Xinyun asked with delight.</p>
 <p>“Haha, really.” Bai Yunfei nodded. “The questions I have been thinking about arose from the training method master gave me. He said it was meant for people with two essence fireseeds, and it is extremely strong. I’ve been studying it for two days now, but all I got was a headache… that’s why I’m out here taking a break…”</p>
 <p>“I see now…” Tang Xinyun nodded in understanding, “Don’t you worry, the amazing techniques are always harder to learn. Just take it easy and you’ll understand it soon enough.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that’s what I was thinking. I have to learn to walk before I can start running. If there’s several thousand characters to read, then I’ll just have to understand each individual one to get the big picture.”</p>
 <p>He chose to avoid the fact that he was extremely impatient to learn the skills, so he chose instead to look at Tang Xinyun’s face, “What about you? Any problems since you regained your essence fireseed? How’s the third elder taking it?”</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing to worry about!” Tang Xinyun smiled, “Master has already looked me over and said that everything looks fine like before. There shouldn’t be any hindrances to my training either, and after all those medicines father gave me, master said that my potential growth has grown as well. I should be able to train extremely well in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Really? That’s amazing!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was glad to hear that. At last, he could finally stop feeling guilty about Tang Xinyun’s sacrifice back in Curopia City.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei could feel happy about something else as well. When Tang Xinyun mentioned her father, it was no longer with an emotionless and detached tone like before.</p>
 <p>Their last trip home and the change in the Tang helped Tang Xinyun feel better about her family.</p>
 <p>Watching as the clouds in the sky floated by, Tang Xinyun chose then to mention something, “Oh, have you heard, Yunfei? The junior headmaster of the Beast Taming School and the one who had bid for the fireseed spirit mushroom against you in the auction house, Mo… something… they’re here in the Crafting School.”</p>
 <p>Unable to stop himself from chuckling at her attempt to remember Mo Ni’s name, Bai Yunfei smiled, “Haha, it’s Mo Ni. I know already. He came to see me two days ago.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? What did he want?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t really know. He just said a few things to me.” Bai Yunfei shook his head in confusion, “But… he might look like a decent person or someone who treats others fairly, yet I can’t help but have my doubts about him. I feel like he was testing me, but I don’t know why…”</p>
 <p>“Really? I heard one of my seniors say that he’s from one of the isolated clans in the Western Frontier Province, one of the stronger ones too… if he’s friendly with the Beast Taming School, then it stands to reason that the Beast Taming School…”</p>
 <p>“Hah… I don’t like the Beast Taming School.” Bai Yunfei continued, “I heard that Lin Dongxiao is here as a representative of his school to apologize for what happened in Curopia City. They’ve some sort of excuse, saying that the tamers we killed were some traitors they had expelled a few years ago. I wonder if that excuse will be accepted…”</p>
 <p>“Is it an excuse? I think I heard master mention before that they had found clues in Curopia City proving that those tamers had been expelled from the Beast Taming School three years ago. Something major happened three years ago, causing one of the elders to defect. It was major news at the time, and a decent part of the Beast Taming School rebelled because of that elder. A lot of them were driven out, but not before a lot of damage was done.”</p>
 <p>“What? Is that true?”</p>
 <p>The words Song Lin had spoken to Bai Yunfei started to resurface in his mind.</p>
 <p>Indeed, Song Lin had once said something about an accident taking place in the Beast Taming School three years ago. It connected with what Tang Xinyun had said, making Bai Yunfei having to think for a bit. “If things are like what that Lin Dongxiao said, then those beast tamers we killed really were traitors to the school. So that means they aren’t connected to the school then?”</p>
 <p>“I… don’t really know, but the headmaster has already accepted the Beast Taming School’s apologies. He agreed to not hold them accountable, and they’ve agreed to hold an open investigation together too.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, so senior Kou has already reached a decision?” He was surprised. “Ugh, whatever then. Let’s talk about something else. How do you feel about going to Redfire City in a few days to have a look around?”</p>
 <p>“In Redfire City?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s been awhile since we went there. Let’s have Zhiqiu, Xiaoxuan, and the others join us. Since Fei Nian likes Sima Yue, I know he’ll agree to come. It’ll be fun if we all go together. We haven’t done anything like as one group since before we left for Curopia City.”</p>
 <p>Tang Xinyun nodded her head, “Sounds good to me.”</p>
 <p>“I remember Sima Dong once telling me about a materials store in the south-western part of the city. We should go over there and take a look while we’re at it…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Conversation continued between the two after that. Now that there wasn’t anything to be concerned about, and Bai Yunfei’s attempts to make Tang Xinyun laugh worked. He was able to hear a giggle from her every so often.</p>
 <p>Time quickly passed by as they laughed, and before either of the two knew it, it was already noon. Looking up at the sky, Tang Xinyun stood up, “Well, Yunfei, I have to go back now…”</p>
 <p>“Alright, let me walk you back.”</p>
 <p>She didn’t refuse his invitation. She only nodded before walking to the path first.</p>
 <p>Before she could get far, Bai Yunfei pointed at the hat Tang Xinyun was still holding, “Eer… my hat, Xinyun…?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, this thing?” She shook the strawhat with a smile, “Let me hold onto it for now, I’ll give it back to you in a bit.”</p>
 <p>“Uh…” Though a little mystified by such a request, Bai Yunfei acquiesced it to her. Choosing not to say anything, he moved to catch up to Tang Xinyun and started to walk side by side with her.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, the two of them reached the spot where the Western Point met with the Main Point. As they were about to cross to the path that lead to the Eastern Point, the two saw a group of people running over from the Southern Point.</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei looked closer, he could see Mo Xiaoxuan leading the group.</p>
 <p>“Xiaoxuan!” He called out.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai, cousin Tang!” Stopping where he was for a brief second, Mo Xiaoxuan hurriedly started toward them with renewed speed, “What are you two doing here?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“I was bringing Xinyun back. Why are you all in such a hurry?”</p>
 <p>Mo Xiaoxuan glanced at the two people with him before turning back to Bai Yunfei to say, “I was on my way down to receive the guests in the outer dormitories.”</p>
 <p>“We’ve guests?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, a small school came this morning asking for some soul armaments. Senior Tiechui received them in the Southern Point to discuss some business, but since it’s noon, he asked me to prepare some food and shelter for the school.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, so they’re here for soul armaments.” Bai Yunfei remarked. These type of requests were pretty common between the smaller schools and clans. Naturally, the elders of the Crafting School would not see to all guests, so the smaller schools and clans were often met with seniors, such as Li Tiechui, who would see to their requests and accept their materials. The materials made in return weren’t very high in quality. They were mid-earth at most, and of course, it was Li Tiechui that usually saw to everything.</p>
 <p>Now that he knew it was a small school here as a guest, Bai Yunfei lost interest in the affair, “Where is the school from?”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei didn’t really care who they were, but when Mo Xiaoxuan answered him, he fell into a stupor.</p>
 <p>“Where they’re from? I think I heard them say they’re from far away, the Azure Cloud Province…” Mo Xiaoxuan scratched his head, “Their school was called the er… the Gla… Glac...</p>
 <p>“Oh! Right, the Glacial School!!"</p>
