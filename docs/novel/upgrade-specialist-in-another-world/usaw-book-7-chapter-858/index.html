 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Even from such a large distance as this one, they were able to watch the battle without too much difficulty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man in the middle wore black robes with golden edges. His face wasn’t hidden, and it could be seen that this was the very same person Bai Yunfei fought to a standstill back in Crushed Stone River…Mo Ni!</span></p>

His hair and beard were white, and his body was slightly skinny. Despite his wrinkled face, the elder’s eyes were uncharacteristically sharp and his expression quite youthful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He and the other two had been observing the battle between the Soul Kings and Bai Yunfei impassively for a good while. But the longer the battle continued, the more varied their expressions became. Soon, the elder in purple had a thunderstruck expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take much for Mo Ni to notice the look. “Elder Li, what’s going in the battle now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was an Early-stage Soul King and didn’t have much of an ability to see the battle. All he could do was look at the outbursts of elemental energy and feel the faint fluctuations in the air. The changes in the expression of the elder were the only indication of how the battle was going, but the fact that the battle could even bring forth a change on the Late-stage Soul King’s face was astonishing enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder—also known as Li Fenghai—didn’t look away from the battle. “Fang Shouwen and Li Fu are both dead. The dozen other Soul Exalts are dead as well. Gui Wei and Huang Shan are the only ones left, but…perhaps not for long.”</span></p>

How is that possible! How were they able to reach this place so quickly?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That isn’t it. The Tang haven’t had anyone else come. The person fighting now is our primary target, Bai Yunfei.”</span></p>

Did he have the elders of the Crafting School help him get here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Again, that’s not it. He’s here alone.” Li Fenghai shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Confusion flashed across Mo Ni’s face. “He’s by himself? Then…how did Fang Shouwen and the others die? Who’s the one fighting Huang Shan and Gui Wei then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bai Yunfei. He killed both Fang Shouwen and Li Fu instantaneously and is currently fighting the other two. Li Hanfeng is on the verge of death, and Huang Shan won’t be able to hang on for much longer. Their soulbeasts are also being fought back by Bai Yunfei’s soulbeasts. And then Gui Wei…I can see him trying to run, but the two men from the Tang earlier have stopped him. Things do not look well for Gui Wei…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wha—what?!”</span></p>

That’s impossible!! Even if he used that special skill last time to power himself up, he should’ve been able to fight at the level of an Early-stage Soul King only, how could he poss—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength he’s showing now shows him to be a Mid-stage Soul King.” Li Fenghai interrupted, “The King’s Phenomena earlier was from him becoming a Soul King. He managed to reach the limits of what an Early-stage Soul King could do before using that skill you mentioned before to become a Mid-stage Soul King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? That was his doing? He became a Soul King? And getting that far after breaking through before powering up again?! That’s…that’s…”</span></p>

The information he was hearing seemed almost impossible to digest, and he couldn’t help but think it was all ‘impossible’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Li Fenghai wouldn’t lie to him for no reason whatsoever. That meant this was true, and that made it even harder for Mo Ni to wrap his head around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several seconds passed before Mo Ni came to an answer to how this situation came to be. “Could it be the Extreme King Pills?! We…we noticed a bit of the Extreme King Pill fragrance earlier, didn’t we? That had have been from the Core Stone! When he got the Core Stone, he must’ve managed to get his hands onto some of the Extreme King Pill fragrance! And that’s why he’s as strong as he is now! That has to be it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! Damn him!!” Mo Ni snarled vehemently. Everything was going wrong. Mo Ni felt as if those items had been&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">stolen</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;from him. “The Core Stone, the Extreme King Pill fragrance…those were supposed to been mine!! All mine! That Bai Yunfei…damn him! Damn him to death!!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His head snapped up to glare at Li Fenghai. “Elder Li, you’re the only one capable of turning this situation around! Bai Yunfei must die today! We must take the Core Stone! That man can’t…he can’t be allowed to live!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I find it hard to believe it all as well. But indeed, this root that is Bai Yunfei needs to be snipped before it can grow any longer…” Li Fenghai nodded his head pensively, “And to lose so many men, even if they were wandering soul cultivators, is a strong blow to our strength. They weren’t easy to convince over to our side, and to lose them without seeing any returns? I would never be able to meet the headmaster eye-to-eye after this. Taking the Core Stone and all of Bai Yunfei’s soul armaments would be a tremendous boon…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last sentence was all it took for the elder to change his mind. Looking back in the direction of Bai Yunfei, the elder had a gleam of killing intent in them now.</span></p>

Reappearing several kilometers away, the man continued to teleport over and over again before ultimately disappearing from Mo Ni’s sight…&nbsp;</span></p>

Blood and flesh flew everywhere from the ape’s body to reveal the internal organs behind it. Moments after, the open wound froze over as a makeshift bandage, but while the glacial ape was too busy dealing with its wound, five pitch-black blades of energy came descending down onto it!</span></p>

Eyes widening and pupils dilating, the ape let loose another terrifying roar and tried its best to make it out from the attack’s range despite the heavy wound it had only just received.</span></p>

Despite doing a very good job in dodging the first four strikes, the ape was powerless to do anything but watch as the fifth strike went through its shoulder…&nbsp;</span></p>

An explosion of elemental ice froze both halves over their wounds so that no blood leaked out before the halves ultimately fell back down to the ground.</span></p>
