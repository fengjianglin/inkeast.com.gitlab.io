 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s Lin Dongxiao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get out of the way! That Lin Dongxiao doesn’t listen to reason, he’ll kill you for no reason at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We came up the mountain from his side, don’t get in his way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud ruckus when Lin Dongxiao made his arrival. Dozens of soul cultivators immediately moved out of the way for him, allowing him a relatively empty passage forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Lin Dongxiao had a pleased sneer on his face as everyone moved away from him. Judging from his position, Lin Dongxiao was about five hundred meters from the top. This put him at the middle of the group with plenty of people both in front and behind him. Sneering again, he rushed forward, no longer caring for those people behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were roughly twenty to thirty people in front of him still. His soulsense wasn’t able to sense the people on the other side of the mountain peak, but he didn’t care much. With a wave of his hand, a white crane appeared in front of him to sit on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stored away the golden tiger that had been protecting him previously and leapt onto the back of the crane. Slapping it on the back, he ordered the crane to take off towards the peak of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Him sitting on the crane allowed Lin Dongxiao a greater speed than running on foot like the others. In practically seconds, he was far beyond anyone else of the same position he had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t the only one with a flying soulbeast, however. In the air with him were another seven or eight people with the same idea he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that didn’t mean they were given freedom and safety up in the air. One of the people flying above was immediately shot down by a burst of fire from down below. Flying on soulbeasts was an act that earned the hostility of everyone down below and so they were one of the first to be struck down. Not a single person was willing to let them fly into the skies if they had anything to say about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So very few of the people there were able to fly into the skies. Those who tried were either forced to come back down or spent too much time evading and dodging the attacks to make any progress towards the top.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That left about four people up in the air, Lin Dongxiao included. The three others were all riding on top of a late-stage class six double-headed eagle, and each of them wore robes identical to one another. It was evident that they were all from the same faction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get in my way and die, scram!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Again, Lin Dongxiao demanded the people in front of him to move. The crane underneath him flapped its wings in an attempt to fly even faster. In the blink of an eye, Lin Dongxiao was practically trailing behind the three eagles. He waved his right hand like if he was wielding a giant golden claw on it to strike at the back of one of the people there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pah! Lin Dongxiao! You’re an arrogant one!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike the first time, these people weren’t giving way to him. They looked prepared to take on Lin Dongxiao, and the soldierly-looking person in the middle waved his right hand in response. A brown turtle shell appeared over his arm and stopped the golden claws from striking him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outrage flickered across Lin Dongxiao’s eyes as he drew his weapon back. “Die then!” He spat with thunderous rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ring on the forefinger of his left hand gleamed with light before a dragonfly the size of a tuna appeared in front of him. It buzzed threateningly once it came out before flying straight towards the man in the middle like a cannonball!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To follow up on that, Lin Dongxiao activated the ring on his right hand. It flashed once with white light before a crystal-like pigeon appeared in front of him. Though small in size, the pigeon was a late-stage class six soulbeast! It appeared into the world with a faint burst of wind, and then it took off with a secondary burst of wind to fly like an arrow towards the man on the right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then he swung his golden claws out again to strike at the short male on the left!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soldierly-looking man in the middle barked out. White light flowed out from his body as his hands went through several hand seals. The soulforce in his body started to spike drastically before spiraling around his right forefinger. Jabbing it behind him, the man had his soulforce freeze the air around him. In seconds, hundreds of icicles formed out of thin air like a barrage of spikes to pelt down Lin Dongxiao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a flash of green and cyan light as his two companions started their own preparations. It took them a second more before they could send a burst of their elemental energy towards Lin Dongxiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of explosions rocked the airspace above the mountain as the attacks crashed against Lin Dongxiao. Waves of elemental energy surged out everywhere, including the bottom where most of the people had to move out of the way from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Lin Dongxiao was fighting the three other equally-strong enemies of his, another fight was breaking out on the other side with Zheng Kai’s group and another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That other person was Li Yuchun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Yuexia had nearly met her end at the hands of Li Yuchun when she was separated from Yu Li and Yue Feng. It was only because of Zheng Kai’s timely intervention that she was able to escape. For that, Yue Feng held a grudge over Li Yuchun. Now that the two were face to face, Yue Feng would bother to demand justification, he’d skip over that and head straight for execution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Yuchun had two slight advantages over Zheng Kai’s group. He was a few dozen meters ahead of them and was also capable of teleporting away. But even if they didn’t have a grudge against him, they’d still fight him in order to stall and prevent him from advancing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Feng wasn’t the only group Li Yuchun was fighting either. Several others had the same idea as Yue Feng and attacked Li Yuchun in order to stop him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Li hadn’t bothered to attack him since she was more focused on protecting Nangong Yuexia. Blow after blow, Yue Feng moved to attack Li Yuchun with all he had. He had a dual affinity for both elemental ice and lightning, but he preferred to use elemental lightning to attack. Rays of lightning arced out from his body one after another like tiny tendrils to seemingly create a territory of his own. Not only did it protect him from attacks, but it was also charging up his own attacks on Li Yuchun every other second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rigorous storm of lightning bolts made it difficult for Li Yuchun to teleport away. It was annoying that he had to weave left and right to dodge them all. A blade of spatial energy would be sent every so often at Yue Feng, but Zheng Kai would stop it with a blade of his own.</span></p>

The most noticeable group was the one comprised of the students from the Five Elements Schools. You Qingfeng and Zhong Liyan, for example, were cutting through every other group like hot knives through butter to clear the path up. If nothing was to be done about them, then they’d be the most likely ones to reach the peak of the mountain first.</span></p>

If there was anyone that was substantially stronger than the others, then the surrounding people would turn on him first. In the merciless battlefield of this mountain, the flow of the battle was only getting more and more chaotic towards the top…</span></p>
