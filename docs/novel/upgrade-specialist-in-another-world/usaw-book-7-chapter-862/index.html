 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

A small wisp of black energy could be seen for a small moment before the tornado swallowed it up so that all was back to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike the last time with the gigantic palm of fire, Li Fenghai was unable to break out from this…&nbsp;</span></p>

Once he waved his right hand, the flames that had previously been rampaging in the area around him started to make a swift and abrupt retreat. Several seconds later, the entire world could be seen in its entirety again without a single speck of fire to be found. And even better, not a single piece of grass, vegetation, or otherwise, had been harmed by the apocalyptic nightmare a few moments ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared down at his own right hand after everything was back to normal, his eyes shining with excitement. “The Laws of Fire…so this is it! The strongest form of fire! It’s unbelievably powerful to have killed a Late-stage Soul King so easily like that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Bai Yunfei found it pretty hard to believe what he had just done several mere moments before. It seemed almost like a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Happy now? This is the Core World, if you couldn’t even do that much here, I wouldn’t be worthy of being a Regalia.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;An image of Xiao Fang appeared right by Bai Yunfei’s side.</span></p>

There is no one way that can beat you while you’re here barring a Soul Saint. A mere Soul King would never be able to understand the Laws of Fire, let alone be able to fend themselves from it.”</span></p>

Still, he had to admit that this was not some sort of lie Xiao Fang was trying to pass in order to make itself sound better than it was. Xiao Fang&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">did</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;mention before the many abilities of the Core World, and one of those said abilities was being able to use the Planar Laws. It was just that Bai Yunfei had never really thought much about it until he put it in practice. It simply felt far too ridiculous when he heard it the first time, but now he felt like he could truly appreciate that ability. Using it today to easily kill a Late-stage Soul King? He had to admit that the Core World was terrifying and that the Planar Laws were something that were dreadfully powerful…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Laws of Fire…” He thought back to the profound feeling he once felt before within his body. Though he was really just relying on Xiao Fang to help him use the Laws of Fire in the Core World, it was still an experience that allowed him to feel what the Laws of Fire felt like. Truly, to the Bai Yunfei, this was an experience that was as precious as finding a heaven-tier soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One day…I’ll be able to use that force with my own power!” Bai Yunfei pledged with a fist tightly clenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lowered his head to stare at the spot where Li Fenghai had been standing. That had been the last place where the flames last disappeared from. All that was left here was a single scorched figure: it was Li Fenghai. His robes were burnt away to reveal the badly scorched flesh of his. The intense heat had split apart at his flesh so that blood was flowing from every single crack and dying his person with its color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was still alive. The slight heaving of his chest was proof of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, Li Fenghai didn’t have much longer to live. His life would soon expire in the next couple of minutes at the very most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Qi.”</span></p>

Almost pleased, he called out for Xiao Qi to finish the job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Got it!”</span></p>

Looking equally as excited as Bai Yunfei, the bird flapped his wings to form a ball of fire in front of him. When it fully formed, he had it fly straight through Li Fenghai’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And just like that, Li Fenghai breathed his last. A mighty Late-stage Soul King had expired within the Core World…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His death felt almost cheap even. Had this battle taken place outside, Bai Yunfei would’ve needed to exert a tremendous amount of time and energy to fight Li Fenghai, even while under Berserk Mode. It would’ve even been possible that Li Fenghai might’ve been able to beat Bai Yunfei, but he had been careless. The man had been unable to show his true strength and died before the might of the Planar Laws.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, his death had been quick and was just a source of quick ‘experience’ for Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some sort of practically invisible energy came flying out from Li Fenghai’s body as soon as Xiao Qi killed the man. It was barely visible only to Bai Yunfei and Xiao Qi before flying into Xiao Qi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah…” Xiao Qi cried out in bliss. Spreading his wings briefly before folding it around himself, the bird slowly floated up into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? What’s he doing?”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Xiao Fang asked in confusion.</span></p>

He knew what was going on thanks to his bond with Xiao Qi and could tell that the bird was brimming with strange energy of some kind. And through this bond, he could sense that Xiao Qi’s soulforce was getting stronger and stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Qi had racked up quite the kill streak during this one battle alone and gained an unprecedented amount of the very same amount of energy he received from Li Fenghai.</span></p>

Take a look, but don’t disturb him.” Bai Yunfei replied, “How’s Xinyun right now, Xiao Fang?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, she’s fine.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Laying prone in the air due to the invisible force supporting her weight, Tang Xinyun rested with her eyes shut as if stuck in a deep state of sleep. She looked at peace though, and her lips would sometimes move as if mumbling to herself in her sleep. The only indication that her body was unwell were the fluctuations of soulforce coming from her body. It was faint, but she was still in the middle of recovering. She’d be fine soon, hopefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that she was in such a state to begin with was like a stab of pain to Bai Yunfei’s heart. Gingerly, he raised his right hand to stroke at Tang Xinyun’s cheek, “It’s my fault again, how many times is this now? I’m…I’m sorry, Xinyun…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone that hurt you so far will die a painful death…I…I’ll definitely make sure they’ll pay the price!”</span></p>

Wasting no more time to speak, Bai Yunfei disappeared from the Core World to return to the real world. He had still business to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

The permafrost mastiff’s eyes were a crimson-red and eerie even to look at.
