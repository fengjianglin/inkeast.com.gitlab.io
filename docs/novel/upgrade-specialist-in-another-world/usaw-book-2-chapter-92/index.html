 <p>Chapter 92: The Thief of the Space Ring</p>
 <p>Even as a mid-stage Soul Sprite, he had his space ring stolen while he was wearing it on his hand!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei stared at his right hand in awe for two seconds before snapping out of it and whirling around.</p>
 <p><em>“It was that guy just now! It had to be him that stole it!”</em> Bai Yunfei’s eyes narrowed as he searched the crowd. <em>“But how? How was he able to take my space ring without me noticing it at all?! Besides, he’s just an ordinary civilian! Just how….”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes began to search through the several hundred meters of people, but he wasn’t able to find the figure of the person who had bumped into him.</p>
 <p>After a fruitless search, Bai Yunfei felt amazed. Relaxing his eyes, Bai Yunfei suddenly thought of something and couldn’t help but let out a faint chuckle, “How did I forget? With that, as long as he doesn’t exit Stonegroove City, I’ll be able to find him no matter where he hides!”</p>
 <p>“Do you think that I am easy to bully after stealing my space ring?” Bai Yunfei scratched at his chin. “But how did he know I had a space ring on my right hand? Was he following me for a long time? I didn’t see him for a long time….how was I so careless? Or does he have some sort of method of stealth to hide his presence?”</p>
 <p>“First, I have to find him and take back my space ring before anything else.” Bai Yunfei determined. Without another thought, he immediately closed his eyes and began to sense for something while standing in the streets.</p>
 <p>If it had been any other soul cultivator, this would be a hard situation for them. However, for Bai Yunfei, finding the location of his space ring wouldn’t be challenging at all. That was because he had his Fire-tipped Spear in his space ring still!</p>
 <p>Like Hong Yin had said, the Flameblade Bracer and the Fire-tipped Spear&nbsp;were Bai Yunfei’s ‘soulbound armaments’. There was a connection between him and the soul armaments, so Bai Yunfei would know of the existence of the Fire-tipped Spear even in the space ring!</p>
 <p>Several seconds later, Bai Yunfei’s eyes flew up and his mouth curled into a smile. Turning to an alleyway to his left, he began to run down it without hesitation.</p>
 <p>Although Bai Yunfei had taken it to be an alley, the width of the alleyway was quite wide in comparison to the streets. It was practically a shortcut to another street with plenty of people in the alleyways along with street stalls.</p>
 <p>Following his instincts down this path, Bai Yunfei walked at a brisk pace for a moment before suddenly starting to slow down. Staring at the people in front of him, there was now a suspicious look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>His eyes began to narrow as he studied the people in front of him for any discrepancies.</p>
 <p>After making his way out from the alley, Bai Yunfei seemed to have made a discovery. Without any hesitation, he quickly overtook and blocked the path of a person.</p>
 <p>“Kid, what are you doing?” An elderly voice came out from the person Bai Yunfei had stopped. Afterward, he gave two short coughs in weakness — this was a 70 year old elderly man!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei studied the appearance of the man in front of him for a long time. No matter how much he looked at him, all he saw was an ordinary elderly man in front of him. His eyes were muddy, his waist was hunched, and his hands were behind his back in a very weak-looking manner.</p>
 <p>But… Bai Yunfei’s eyes glistened continuously; without a word, his right hand flew forward and grabbed the elder’s shoulder!</p>
 <p>“Kid, you — what are you doing?!” The elder was startled so much that his body was pushed back. Almost as if he were stumbling back, the elder looked like he would tumble to the ground any second.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes stared deeper. With a step, he used the Treading Wave Step to flash toward the elder. Right underneath the startled eyes of the others, Bai Yunfei grabbed onto the man’s left wrist with his right hand and raised it up to his eyes.</p>
 <p>Hidden away in the sleeves of the elder, there was nothing to denote the “elderly” wrinkles that came with age. Instead, there was the arm of a young man filled with energy. More importantly, right on the forefingers of the man was a black ring — this was the space ring of Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>Before the other man could respond, Bai Yunfei had taken back his space ring. Staring at the thunderstruck ‘elder’, Bai Yunfei spoke icily, “Speak, why did you take my space ring? How did you manage to ‘change’ your appearances like that? Speak the truth, and I’ll…”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei hadn’t even finished speaking before the eye’s of the man in front of him suddenly changed. From a murky color to clear eyes filled with energy, the man snorted. Bai Yunfei could only feel a spot of emptiness as the other man’s wrist suddenly turned small and escaped his grasp!</p>
 <p>The man’s back and waist straightened afterward. There was no more of an elderly feel to him as his foot stomped on the ground and instantly flitted past Bai Yunfei toward another street.</p>
 <p>There was a strange light in Bai Yunfei’s eyes. With a twist of his feet, he began to chase after the other man in close pursuit.</p>
 <p>Just as the man was about to charge into the alleyway past a crowd, a sudden gust of wind blew past the side of his head. It blew past him and then in front of him before an image quickly followed. Bai Yunfei blocked him once more and brought a fist to the man’s chest!</p>
 <p>Helpless to do anything else, the man could only bring up both arms. With a bang, he was sent backward. Bai Yunfei had not used the Overlapping Wave Arts, otherwise he too would have been blown back as well.</p>
 <p>“Tsk! How did I get so unlucky to have bothered such an annoying person?” The man’s face grew serious with just a sliver of vexation in his face. Taking several steps back, he took a cautious stare at Bai Yunfei while an azure color qi began to move around him. No longer did he looked like an aged person, whether it was in appearance or movement, he was clearly a young man!</p>
 <p>“Early-stage Soul Sprite!” Bai Yunfei’s eyebrows flew up in shock. “There wasn’t enough soulforce coming out of him earlier for me to even consider him out of the ordinary before. But now he’s bringing out enough soulforce to be a Soul Sprite! Was he hiding his strength before? But… how did he do that?”</p>
 <p>“Kid, you’ve already taken your things back, don’t be a bully! Let me leave and we can pretend this didn’t happen at all!” Just as Bai Yunfei was thinking, the other man had taken the opportunity to speak first. His voice was no longer old sounding. He had resumed the voice of a young man who had taken his space ring in the first place.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had been taken aback before sneering, “You didn’t do anything wrong? You stole my things, how could you be so arrogant?”</p>
 <p>“Then will you not let me go?” The man’s glare hardened. With a cold snort, he brought his foot down and shot toward Bai Yunfei with the speed of wind, “If you wish to fight, then let us fight!”</p>
 <p>“Yi? Why are these words so familiar-sounding?” Bai Yunfei’s lips twitched. He waited for his opponent to draw.close, he then took half a step back and brought his right hand up at the same time. A flash of red light could be seen before Bai Yunfei’s hand grabbed it and slammed it forward.</p>
 <p>This was the long-awaited brick!!</p>
