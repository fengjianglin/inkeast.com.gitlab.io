 <p>Chapter 451: Battling a Soul Refiner, and the Soul Sucking Skill!</p>
 <p>Doppelgangers, the spear explosion, the Flame Winged Dagger, and the Cataclysmic Seal….</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was relentless in his onslaught. Each move in the sequence flowed together with minimal superfluous movements. All of this was possible only due to Bai Yunfei’s practiced hand with his equipment. The Bai Yunfei of today was no longer the weakling of before. He was Bai Yunfei, the late-stage Soul Exalt who was slowly beating his enemy bit by bit!</p>
 <p>Another spray of blood flew out from his enemy’s mouth. Rattled by the unexpected blow, the man felt similar to being a piece of paper flowing in the wind with just how useless he had been in front of that brick!</p>
 <p>If he had to describe himself at the moment, it’d be just one word: fear!</p>
 <p>Previous to this three-hit combo, he had been so sure that he was close to waiting out all of Bai Yunfei’s attacks. He just needed to wait a little longer to defeat Bai Yunfei, but now that the tables had turned, he wasn’t even sure if he’d be able to last until then….</p>
 <p>Damnit!</p>
 <p>He needed to launch a counter attack!</p>
 <p>He wiped the blood away from his mouth with furious passion. As an attendant of his school and late-stage Soul Exalt ready to step onto the next level, the man feared very few from those not yet at the Soul King level.</p>
 <p>So how was it that there was a weakling early-stage Soul Exalt beating him to a pulp?!</p>
 <p>The man forced soulforce to his legs, forming platforms for him to leap up and over the Cataclysmic Seal. Looking down at Bai Yunfei, his eyes started to shine brilliantly with golden light. Traveling down from his eyes to the sword in his hand, the light filled the sword with energy before the man swung it down to release a torrent of golden light!</p>
 <p>This was his soul skill, the Golden Blade Wave!</p>
 <p>As its name implied, the golden energy released resembled that of a sturdy wave as it ‘poured’ down onto Bai Yunfei as if threatening to drown him in it!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei observed the attack with narrowed eyes. From what he could tell, this attack had a wide area of attack and wouldn’t be easy to dodge. He lifted the Cataclysmic Seal up in front of him, allowing for his soulforce to be drained into it and have it grow in size!</p>
 <p>From its original size of a hundred meters, the Cataclysmic Seal transformed three times its size to become as large as a mountain to stop the wave in entirety!</p>
 <p>The Cataclysmic Seal was now a gigantic block that stood on top of the earth, making it look like a natural mountain had springed up to divide Bai Yunfei and his enemy.</p>
 <p><em>“It can still grow bigger!!”</em></p>
 <p>The man was nearly besides himself with shock. He had never heard of a soul armament whose original size being only the size of a palm being able to grow so tremendously large. As he stood in front of it, he started to feel the situation to be a little ridiculous even, and he began to wonder if he was stuck in some sort of illusion or something.</p>
 <p>But that notion was dashed when he watched his attack slam into the Cataclysmic Seal. It slammed against the wall like a proper wave would, and then as physics would dictate, it started to flow backwards back in his direction!</p>
 <p>Now completely safe from the attack, Bai Yunfei had the Cataclysmic Seal shrink back to its original size. Though having the brick in such a large state was extremely powerful, it was also extremely costly in soulforce.</p>
 <p>Unless Bai Yunfei was sure he could kill with it, he wanted to keep his soulforce consumption to a minimum just in case.</p>
 <p>With the ‘great mountain’ that stood between them now gone, Bai Yunfei was the first to race back up into the skies. A hundred meters above the other, Bai Yunfei placed away the Cataclysmic Seal when he realized the other person was preparing yet another soul skill!</p>
 <p>Activating the Flash Steps, he zoomed towards the man and threw three separate Burstfire Daggers and then another dagger that disappeared without a trace behind the other<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>it was the Flickering Dagger!</p>
 <p>It was one of Bai Yunfei’s most strongest daggers in his possession and had also a very practical effect added onto it.</p>
 <p>Flickering Dagger stats:</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong><strong>Equipment Grade: Mid Earth </strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Elemental Affinity: Wind </strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Upgrade Level: +10</strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Attack: 880 </strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Additional Attack: 400 </strong></strong><br><strong><strong>Soul Compatibility: 11% </strong></strong><br><strong><strong>+10 Additional Effect: 60% increase in piercing strength.</strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 100 Soulpoints&nbsp;</strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Dodging the three Burstfire Daggers without any time to waste, the man was beginning to feel safe before he realized a fourth dagger aimed at his heart!</p>
 <p>Completely unable to dodge, the man tried his best to reflect the dagger with his sword. The dagger slammed into it with a clang, but rather than seeing it deflected, the man felt a sharp pain in his chest!</p>
 <p>Looking down, he saw a hole in the middle of his high-earth tier soul armament, and a nearly-transparent dagger stabbing through it!</p>
 <p>Sweat immediately started to form over his skin as panic sunk in. It was truly fortunate for him that the dagger had only stabbed just an inch into his body, and not completely into it as he first feared!</p>
 <p><em>“Just how many soul armaments does he have?!”</em> The man cried out to himself. Over the course of the battle so far, the man had counted at least ten, including the daggers, making him go slightly mad with disbelief.</p>
 <p>But now wasn’t the time for him to grumble and complain.</p>
 <p>A fiery spear was coming straight at his eye!</p>
 <p>Prior to the dagger landing, Bai Yunfei was already moving forward. He didn’t care whether or not if it hit, Bai Yunfei just wanted to attack.</p>
 <p>The spear stabbed onto the broken sword of his enemy before pushing past it and across the man’s right shoulder.</p>
 <p>Eyeing Bai Yunfei’s position, the man’s right hand suddenly flew up to grab onto the left hand of Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>It was with great joy that the man’s hand clutched onto Bai Yunfei’s wrist. Grunting in exertion as his body started to absorb the golden light around him, black mist replaced it as an outbreak of elemental darkness went from his right hand into Bai Yunfei’s left arm!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei, who had just about to strike the man again, felt his body start to grow weak. Looking down to where his hand was being grabbed onto, Bai Yunfei was startled to feel his soulforce start to drain away!</p>
 <p>Secret art of the Soul Refining School, Soul Sucking Skill!!</p>
 <p>Author Note: This is another world version of Jin Yong’s 吸星大法</p>
 <p>A battle of close combat was what people from the Soul Refining School excelled at, and it was to Bai Yunfei’s great misfortune and inexperience that he fell for it!</p>
 <p>The feeling of powerlessness grew heavier and heavier even with the +12 ring on his left hand working continuously against it. But in time, Bai Yunfei felt himself almost unable to move!</p>
 <p>It didn’t seem the soul refiner was able to do anything else either, elsewise he would’ve raised the still functional sword of his to slit Bai Yunfei’s throat and end the battle there.</p>
 <p>He was actually surprised with how Bai Yunfei was resisting; the resistance he was experiencing was far stronger than he thought, and the absorption rate was a lot slower than he anticipated. He tried to calm down, though. With how panicked Bai Yunfei looked, the man was pretty confident his own victory was at hand. He just needed to clean out the rest of Bai Yunfei’s soulforce and leave him dry.</p>
 <p>From there, wouldn’t it be a simple matter to kill Bai Yunfei?</p>
 <p>Sneering at the thought, the soul refiner pushed his soulforce a little harder to work the elemental darkness faster. And the more he pushed, the more Bai Yunfei’s face started to pale and his soulforce start to lessen!</p>
 <p>Each push the soul refiner made pushed Bai Yunfei closer and closer down a cliff. If Bai Yunfei’s soulforce was a jar of water, the soul refiner was draining it out with a bucket once every second!</p>
 <p>Three seconds passed, then four, then five….</p>
 <p>Ten seconds later, Bai Yunfei’s soulforce was well below the halfway point!!</p>
