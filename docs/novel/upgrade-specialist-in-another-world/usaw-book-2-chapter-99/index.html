 <p>Chapter 99: Aunty, I really Don't Know Anything!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was dumbfounded for a moment. Looking to his left and then to his right, he had realized the eyes of everyone around him were staring at him. Looking back at the two women in front of him, he asked in confusion,</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Aunt Zhao looked at Bai Yunfei’s reaction and then to the item he was holding in his left hand. Beginning to tremble all over with a mighty shake, she looked as if she was on the verge of losing complete control over herself like last night. With a finger pointed at Bai Yunfei, she snarled, “You shameless knave!! Don’t even think about playing the idiot! Last night you molested the young miss of my family. And… and… just what is that you’re holding in your hand then?!”</p>
 <p>“Eh? What is it?” Bai Yunfei was startled, but raising his left hand to look, he immediately began to tremble….</p>
 <p>A single sweatdrop dripped down Bai Yunfei’s head — it, it was the underwear of a woman?!</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>There was a hissing sound coming from all around him, causing Bai Yunfei to look around himself. Everyone on the street had given themselves ten meters of room and glared at him with scornful eyes…</p>
 <p>“This… this wasn’t me…” Bai Yunfei held the underwear with a trembling left hand, and even his voice was quavering.</p>
 <p>“Oh of course! Of course it wasn’t you, it was me then!!” Aunt Zhao was already on the breaking point of her anger.</p>
 <p>“Booo!!” The audience around them began to explode in a fit of hissing sounds as they continued to glare at him.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei felt as if he was about to cough out blood from this situation and hurried to explain himself. “No, no! I’m saying that someone just stuffed this into my hand. I’m…”</p>
 <p>Halfway through his speech, Bai Yunfei closed his mouth. It was useless to explain to these two. Even the audience around them wasn’t willing to listen to Bai Yunfei; if there was any reaction, it would be the scornful look in their eyes…</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s lips began to twitch as if he was on the verge of crying. Lifting out his left hand, he took one step after another toward the two and stuttered, “Au-aunty… I’m speaking the truth. If this is yours, then… here, take it...”</p>
 <p>With that, he handed the piece of underwear back to the aunt. In his anxiety, he had subconsciously stuffed the wooden bird he had just bought into the hands of the girl to aunt’s side.</p>
 <p>The aunt took the bra back, but when it came in contact with her hand, she paused. Feeling as if something was wrong, she took the article of clothing and then held it up…</p>
 <p>Someone had taken scissors to it. Two holes were cut accurately to show two specific spots on the bra…</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes saw the holes, causing his soul to practically fly away from his mouth almost. This time, he regained his wits quickly, and without any explanation, he staggered back several steps in retreat.</p>
 <p>“You pervert, I’ll kill you!!”</p>
 <p>In the same instance that Bai Yunfei had retreated, the aunty could no longer control her fury. Putting away the bra, her fist immediately chased after Bai Yunfei to strike him down.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei could see it coming however and easily dodged the strike. Still retreating back, he cried out, “Aunty, don’t misunderstand! This really has nothing to do with me, I’ve never seen you before in my life!”</p>
 <p>“You still dare to deny it! Is your surname not Bai?!”</p>
 <p>“Ye-yes, my surname is Bai… how did you know?”</p>
 <p>“Then what else needs to be said! Your figure is the same, your face is the same, and even your voice is the same! Or do you mean to tell me that the one who dared to grope and molest me and the young miss is your hoodrat of a twin brother!” The aunty cried out in indignation as she chased him. With a shake of her hand, a sword not yet two meters long could be seen. With a circulation of her soulforce, a halo of orange light could be seen enveloping the sword before it stabbed out at Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“You’re kidding! I…” Bai Yunfei slid to the left to dodge the sword stab before once more dodging a horizontal slash from the sword. Then borrowing the power of the incoming fist, he flew back another two steps. Crying out in frustration, he spoke, “Aunty, I really don’t know anything!!”</p>
 <p>The furious aunty wasted no words on him. A tremendous amount of Qi could be seen rolling toward Bai Yunfei with the twist of her sword.</p>
 <p>Startled, Bai Yunfei could no longer say anything. He began to use the Wave Treading Steps to weave left and right around the mirror images left by the sword. Although it looked rather dangerous, there was no damage dealt to Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>“Poof! Poof! Poof!...” Several sounds could be heard while Bai Yunfei circled the street. The ground where he used to be standing had split into several small cracks due to the Qi strikes from the sword. Some of the strikes had even impacted against the ground not far from the audience.</p>
 <p>“Waaa!” The entire audience had been excited to watch this battle take place. Everyone scattered away in fear to areas farther away when it progressed beyond what they had expected. It was as if they were afraid of being inadvertently hit.</p>
 <p>Not too long after, the nearby hundred meters of the street had been completely deserted save the two combatants and the young woman not too far away. Even the nearby buildings had tightly shut their windows.</p>
 <p>Aunt Zhao was a cultivator with the earth property whose distinguishing characteristics were endless. Her offensive and defensive capabilities were strong in their own right, but she lacked in speed. Since she lacked a soul skill to aid her speed, she was unable to land a hit on Bai Yunfei even after several rounds despite her anger. She was unable to make contact with him due to his Wave Treading Steps.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had finally regained his wits. Depressed, Bai Yunfei didn’t know just how this absurd calamity had befallen him. He could only helplessly dodge blow after blow while trying to figure out the best way to resolve this troublesome matter.</p>
 <p>This village-born middle-aged woman in front of him was clearly in a furious state where words would be of no use. After a moment’s thought, Bai Yunfei dodged a strike, and looked to the young women who was observing the fight several dozen meters away.</p>
 <p>“I say, miss! Are you the ‘young miss’ this aunty’s talking about? Can you have this aunty calm down for a moment? You really got the wrong person!” Bai Yunfei dodged an explosive fist strike before dodging another sword strike at the same time he was shouting at the young woman.</p>
 <p>“Yesterday night at nine, I was resting in the ‘Happiness Inn’ in the eastern streets. Although I took a stroll earlier that day, I have never seen you two before. This is all a misunderstanding!”</p>
 <p>The young woman helplessly watched her aunt try to attack Bai Yunfei over and over again. When she heard that seemingly innocent explanation, her eyebrows furrowed together with some confusion.</p>
 <p>After several more exchanges with the young woman not responding to him, Bai Yunfei was beginning to grow a little impatient. His leg shifted away and brought him speeding to the left after retreating away from the aunty. He planned on running near the young woman. That way if the aunty chased after him, she would hesitate to attack. In that time, he would have a moment to be able to figure out just what was happening.</p>
 <p>Under her irate barrage, the aunt had come across almost no resistance from Bai Yunfei at all, causing her fury to grow more and more. When she saw Bai Yunfei head toward the young woman, her eyes widened instantly and began to flow with a murderous killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Scoundrel! You wish to mishandle the young miss again!!”</p>
 <p>Following this flash of killing intent, the aunty began to explode with a rich amount of orange-colored elemental energy. The sword in her right arm made an overarching slash toward the ground so that the tip was touching it. The surrounding earth element began to congregate around the tip of her sword before the metallic cry of the sword could be heard stabbing into the ground in her pursuit of Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>The sword had stabbed into the stone tiles of the ground without a problem. An orange light began to fill the cracks as a crackling sound appeared. Several more cracks could be seen originating from where the sword had stabbed into the ground. In an instant, they had spread in ‘pursuit’ of Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>Seeing Bai Yunfei come running at her, the young woman instinctively retreated back. Adopting a defensive stance, she took on a startled expression before crying out a warning to Bai Yunfei, “Watch yourself!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Yunfei was within a twenty meters away from the older woman, the young woman’s warning immediately warned him of the incoming pulse of elemental energy nearing his body. Startled, he whirled around only to see that the cracks had already reached underneath his feet.</p>
 <p>“No!” Bai Yunfei was startled in that one instant. He abruptly stomped down with enough force to launch him into the air. At that moment, the cracks underneath his feet exploded, shooting fragments of the stones up along with the twisting strands of the earth element. In a movement that covered the entire sky, this storm of rubble and earth force engulfed Bai Yunfei!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes flashed dangerously. With a snort, he shook his hand and pulled out the Fire-tipped Spear. Without decreasing the speed in his feet, the Fire-tipped Spear began to twirl around in an air-tight pattern that completely protected him from the barrage of stone fragments.</p>
 <p>The first wave of stone fragments was far too concentrated, so several fragments hit Bai Yunfei’s body. Even with the Goldsilk Soul Armor protecting him, it still hurt quite a bit.</p>
 <p>After shattering the final stone fragment to pieces, Bai Yunfei turned to look at the relatively far away aunty with a chilling glare. Up to this point, Bai Yunfei had not felt any anger in his heart.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already said that this was a misunderstanding, but if you still want to bring me into this mess, then I will start to fight back!”</p>
