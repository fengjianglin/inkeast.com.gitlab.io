 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this ten-meter lengthed center was a ball of green and black light with Jing Mingfeng inside of it. His head was perked up at the skies and his mouth wide open, though no sound was coming out. Only tears were escaping from his person now as he cried in silence…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he was able to think clearly, Jing Mingfeng was able to piece together what had been done…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Multiple images were flashing through his mind; each one of them originating from Jing Wuying, techniques like Soul Imitation and Voice Concealment were among those images with clear details and etched deep in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a reason why Jing Wuying had decided to pass down that information through this method…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Jing Wuying first awoke, his body was by no means ‘fine’ as he mentioned. There was no way he’d be able to ‘heal’ from the wound given to him. It was a fatal wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Truthfully speaking, Jing Wuying didn’t have much longer to live even if he hadn’t been hit by that attack. He was reaching the end of his natural lifespan. The failure to become a Soul Emperor meant being unable to extend his lifespan, so all that awaited Jing Wuying was a fitting death. Being a Half-emperor allowed him some modicum of longevity, but it was nothing but a stop-gap measure. Another few years and he would die a natural death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying was able to absorb some of the energy from the Soul Fusing Array when he was down in the mines. And given his experience with trying to become a Soul Emperor, the pure energy that coursed through his body at that time was fairly easy to absorb despite him being unknowledgeable about how the Soul Fusing Array functioned. Forcing the energy into his body might’ve been helpful, but it was also detrimental to his health. He was only lucky that he gained more from it than he lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stealing away that energy away from patriarch Qin gave Jing Wuying a small power-up. It would never be enough to help him become a Soul Emperor, but he’d at the very least be strong enough to kill patriarch Qin and then find a place to properly digest the new energy. That way, he’d be given a slight extension on life for a few more years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He just never imagined that patriarch Qin would have the Soul Sealing Mandate on hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was powerless to fight off the power of the Soul Sealing Mandate and couldn’t even offer up a layer of defense against it. While he didn’t die from the following attack, he wasn’t too far away from it…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no recovering from the wounds he got. Even if he tried his hardest, Jing Wuying had only another ten days or so before his strength would give out. He’d have to give up on the new energy he gained in order to do that, but he’d die frail and powerless either way…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying didn’t want a death like that. He wanted a more meaningful death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying was a man whose name was known to many in the world back in his peak days. He killed many Soul Kings before and gained countless treasures from them. Soul armaments, soul skills, herbs, minerals, and other resources…he simply couldn’t even begin to number the amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of those bounties he won, there was one thing in particular that shone above all else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The art of Soul Inheritance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t an offensive or even defensive-type of soul skill. What it did was far beyond either of that. It could impart the training of a person onto someone else!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Author note: This is similar to the ‘inherited arts’ from many Wuxia novels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Power was something people had to work for. Whether they be soulbeast or soul cultivator, both entities would have to learn to walk before they could run. But this technique, which could allow one to profit without putting in the work, could truly be said to be overwhelmingly powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But a powerful technique like that would, of course, require an equally enormous price. Soul Inheritance imparted the training of a person to another at the cost of the user’s life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many people in this world would be willing to sacrifice their own life for the sake of another? To give away the hard-earned fruits of labor for someone else to enjoy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The technique wasn’t something that could impart every little thing either. If there was too drastic of a difference between the essence of the two souls, the technique would fail to transfer much. It was possible not even a fraction of power would be transferred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ‘essence’ of one’s soul. In simpler words, this was the purity of blood between people. Kinsmen would have the best effect when Soul Inheritance was used upon another. But even then, the amount of power gained afterward would still vary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying had long since predicted the day of his death and was prepared to give all he could offer to Jing Mingfeng. For that reason, the elder spent many days to divine the secrets of Soul Inheritance. He just never expected for that day to come so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He came to the decision very quickly. When he was ‘healing’, Jing Wuying was actually just waiting for enough strength for him to activate the technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Wuying knew Jing Mingfeng would refuse had he known the truth. He would have to use a white lie to wait for the proper moment and then let his soul do all explaining…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

He didn’t look any different than before Jing Wuying imparted his training onto him, but Jing Mingfeng could feel it. An enormous amount of power was hidden within his body now. It was melding with his blood, flesh, bone, and even soul now so it could be made available for him to use. And now, he was far stronger than before…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great-grandfather…”</span></p>

It pained him to think about it, but he would recover. The tears were already starting to slow…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Mingfeng was one of the fortunate ones to escape the annihilation of his family the day before. He had been a Soul Sprite when he fled. He was left with nothing but a deep hatred for the ones who killed off his family and forced to hide as he wandered the continent. Alone, he had to rely on foraging for anything that might’ve made him stronger. And some times, he had no other choice but to make use of the Soul Concealment Art and Face Disguise Technique to commit acts of thievery. All the while with a forced smile on his face as he fought to live and grow stronger…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was alone and weak. So weak that he didn’t even know who was responsible for the annihilation of the Jing. But no matter how long he wandered the continent, Jing Mingfeng never forgot about the memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So he was happy beyond doubt when Jing Wuying found him. No longer was he alone to shoulder the revenge of his family! Under the helpful hand of Jing Wuying, he was able to become a Late-stage Soul Exalt within a single short year. And then with the scuffle for the Extreme King Pills, he was able to break through to become a Soul King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought that by following his great-grandfather, he’d be able to take revenge on his enemies.</span></p>
