 <p>Chapter 141: Threefold Slap</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had seen the way Liu Shun was moving on over towards him. Despite the ‘bravado’ he was trying to put up, his staggering had been anything but that, leaving Bai Yunfei to shake his head helplessly.</p>
 <p>He knew that Liu Shun was only at the late-stage Soul Personage realm from the soulforce he released. A mere Soul Personage wasn’t something that he would take seriously. Even if Liu Shun was a young master of a big family, he wouldn’t be scared to the point of running away because of this. He didn’t want to cause trouble, but he wasn’t afraid of getting into trouble.</p>
 <p><em>“But….he’s still someone from the Liu. Since I’m going to pay them a visit tomorrow, it wouldn’t be a good idea to teach this guy a lesson. Anyhow, the Liu are a part of the Wood School, so I shouldn’t worsen my relationship with them.”</em> Bai Yunfei thought for a while, and decided not to bicker with this drunkard in front of him. He raised his head to look at the restaurant’s second floor, hoping that those servants would drag away their young master. Once they did that, this situation would be settled as well.</p>
 <p>But there had been something that caused him to narrow his eyes when he looked up: the attendants of Liu Shun had standing there just watching him<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>as long as Liu Shun didn’t embarrass himself, they wouldn’t move a finger to stop him from doing anything else. It had in fact looked liked they were waiting for a good show to start for them to enjoy.</p>
 <p>He had been slightly angry at that. Turning his eye to look at the rather serious-looking middle-aged man behind the attendants, Bai Yunfei could note that his eyes were those of a vigilant man and had the ramrod back to accompany it.</p>
 <p>Su Dong was Liu Shun’s mid-stage Soul Warrior bodyguard and was considered among of the stronger men of Gaoyi City. When it came to this drinking enthusiast of a charge, he was rather helpless. No matter what, Liu Shun was still the young master he was in charge of protecting, so no matter how drunk Liu Shun got, he was allowed to do so in his own time. So as long as Liu Shun didn’t do anything too over the top, Su Dong would not interfere.</p>
 <p>He didn’t really care about this ‘unfortunate’ youth that was about to be shouted at by the young master. In his opinion, the young master wouldn’t mess around to the point of causing someone’s death, even though he turned crazy after drinking. If worst comes to worst, he could just give this person a lump sum to settle this matter afterwards.</p>
 <p>It had been to his astonishment that this young person had met Liu Shun without fear. When he had looked at the young man, the young man had actually looked back at him as well.</p>
 <p>In a split second, Su Dong’s heart had been gripped with fear and cold sweat began to seep out from his forehead.</p>
 <p>“Are you not going to stop your young master?” In that one moment, the youth had spoke out with a voice of indifference. But despite that, it had been very audible to Su dong’s ears.</p>
 <p>Su Dong didn’t even have the time to rub the sweat off his forehead as he shivered and turned around. Without even hesitating, he pushed away the few people in front of him and jumped down from the second floor.</p>
 <p><em>“An expert<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">—</span>a Soul Sprite no less! Since when did Gaoyi City have such a person like this? And why did it have to be the young master that provoked him!”</em> Su Dong’s heart was pounding from shock. The moment he landed on the ground below, Su Dong was already running up to Liu Shun in an attempt to stop him from doing anything more to offend this person.</p>
 <p>Quickly running up to Liu Shun who was just five meters away from Bai Yunfei, Su Dong reached out to grab at him. As he reached for him, Su Dong cried out in a hurry, “Young master! Stop! That person is….”</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>What happened next had been something that completely unexpected to everyone! In the moment Su Dong’s hand touched Liu Shun, the drunkard had whirled around with his right arm bulging outwards to slam his fist right into Su Dong’s face as if he had been planning to do so!</p>
 <p>Su Dong had been shocked by Bai Yunfei’s appearance, but he had not thought that Liu Shun would punch at him! Caught off guard, the man had been struck backwards a little over ten meters and rendered him dazed for the time being.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! I just knew you were going to ruin my plans! Hah, were you trying to pull a fast one on me? You’re kidding!” Liu Shun had crowed in satisfaction as he brought back his fist.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was speechless. In his mind, he had thought, <em>“Just how badly does this guy hate his bodyguard? Even drunk, he was on guard against these ‘sneak attacks’! Sounds like his bodyguard was always trying to ‘ruin’ his ‘fun’.”</em> It had been a good assumption to make that since Su Dong was far stronger than Liu Shun, he would not injured by any sneak attack by Liu Shun. But because of the fear that Liu Shun would anger Bai Yunfei, he had been mainly focused on him and had been struck by Liu Shun as a result.</p>
 <p>Giving two mad barks of laughter, Liu Shun’s eyes returned back to Bai Yunfei. Kicking off the ground, he flew towards Bai Yunfei with a loud shout, “I’m a man that means what I say! Take off your clothes now!”</p>
 <p>“.......”, Bai Yunfei wasn’t speechless this time, but eerily disturbed. This kid was truly a raving lunatic. Didn’t he know that other people would misunderstand the meaning behind his words?</p>
 <p>Sighing, Bai Yunfei thought, <em>“Since your attendants and your bodyguard won’t protect you, then I’ll do it in their place to pacify you.”</em></p>
 <p>When Liu Shun extended his right hand out to grab his shirt after landing in front of him, Bai Yunfei raised his right hand without any change in expression. A red light flashed, and something seemed to have appeared in his hands. However, no one was able to clearly see it, due to its extremely quick speed. Then, the object in his hand instantly smacked Liu Shun’s skull.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>A muffled sound echoed out. Liu Shun hadn’t even fully landed, while his right hand was only an inch away from Bai Yunfei’s shirt. However, he was sent flying towards the anxious Su Dong in the next instant, and was frantically caught by the latter.</p>
 <p>This was the brick’s +13 effect, Hurling!</p>
 <p>The brick instantly disappeared with a flash of his right hand. Su Dong was simply unable to see what he had taken out, and didn’t even feel any fluctuations in his soulforce.</p>
 <p>Su Dong didn’t even have the time to be stunned by Bai Yunfei’s casual attack. He hastily lowered his head to look at Liu Shun, who was caught by him. Yet, he noticed Liu Shun had already passed out, and that the left side of his forehead was swelling. However, there were no more bruises on Liu Shun’s body except for that. He didn’t find any problems either when he used his soulforce.</p>
 <p>After letting out a long sigh, he noticed that the back of his shirt was already drenched with cold sweat. He looked up and saw that Bai Yunfei was standing in his original location. There had been a smile on Bai Yunfei’s face, but it did not quite reach his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, he’s just knocked out. He’ll be fine after a rest. In the future, make sure to look after him so that he doesn’t cause trouble with the wrong people.” Bai Yunfei nodded his head to him. Then, without a second glance at Su Dong, he turned away,</p>
 <p>Su Dong had been left in a state of shock. He hadn’t thought that Bai Yunfei would let off his young charge that easily. But either way, this had been what he wanted. Turning back to look at the stunned attendants, he barked, “What are you looking at! Hurry up and escort the young master back home!”</p>
 <p>Once more, Bai Yunfei blended in with the crowd of pedestrians walking to and from. From there, he began to slowly ask people for directions back to the Ye.</p>
 <p>Slowly bringing up his right hand to his eyes, he clenched it tightly. “This will work...it’s a little awkward, but as long as I continue to develop it, it’ll become a surprise killing technique! Threefold Slap! Hehehe….”</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had casually took out the brick he hadn’t used for a long time. However, the ‘Threefold Slap’ that Li Chengfeng joked about suddenly appeared in his mind. When Li Chengfeng had talked about it at first, he didn’t take it seriously. He jokingly tested it out for a few times, but had failed. Thus, he threw it to the back of his mind. After all, the uses of the brick and the Firetipped Spear were completely different.</p>
 <p>He didn’t think that he would be able to barely use this technique after attaining his current strength. This was actually something that was a great surprise to him.</p>
 <p>After three consecutive slaps, he would be able to trigger the brick’s +13 effect, as long as nothing unexpected occurred. The probability of the confusion effect and stun effect were also greatly increased. In the future, it seemed like he would have another technique that could catch his opponents off guard.</p>
 <p>Nothing unexpected had happened to Bai Yunfei this time around and had managed to make it back to the Ye after half an hour. Tianming and Jing Mingfeng had returned a long time ago and were currently playing around with something that looked like a cross between a rabbit and a cat. Its fluffy tail was bigger than its body and had the bark of a dog. It wasn’t a soulbeast, but something unique.</p>
 <p>After a few questions, he found out this was something the two had bought in the so-called ‘Unique Beast Garden’, due to Tianming finding it ‘very cute’.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was rendered speechless. He could easily see how ‘cute’ this fellow was... “Right, Tianming. Tomorrow, can you take me to the house of Liu in the afternoon? Since I’ve come, I should go visit them for a bit…”</p>
