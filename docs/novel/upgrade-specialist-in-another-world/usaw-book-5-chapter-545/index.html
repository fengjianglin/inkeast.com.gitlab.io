 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+). &nbsp;Priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET) and MySQL, as those are what our backend is...</p>

We've reviewed nearly 2000 comments across multiple platforms and forum, and while we haven't responded to everything I can promise I HAVE read it all. &nbsp;First, I'm going to briefly go into some of the things which were discussed which may or may not work, because I don't want people to think I ignored anything. I'm putting those in 'spoiler' tags so people who don't care can skip it. &nbsp;Then, we'll talk...</p>

Anger wracked at his body as he started to speak out, “Impossible!! How can I keep losing to you?! How is your luck that good?! You….you’ve got to be cheating! You…!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth prince!” Bai Yunfei interrupted, “Please pay more attention to your words, fourth prince. Accusing someone else of cheating is improper to do. We are all admirable soul cultivators here, and several are stronger than I am. Whether or not I cheated is something that can easily be found out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He honed in on Wu Yang’s face, “Fourth prince, remember your station as a prince. A bet is a bet. As a prince, a small matter like this shouldn’t matter much to you, shouldn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A small matter? I lost three heaven-tier soul armaments to you and a late-stage class six soulgem, can you really say it’s a ‘small’ matter?!”</span></p>

Angry to the point where he wanted to lash out at the world around him. Though he lost plenty of his possessions, he didn’t lose all of his rationality. Breathing in and out several times, he tried to calm himself down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fourth prince….” The indifferent-looking man to Wu Yang’s right spoke up, “Please don’t act on rash impulses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t known if it was that warning that snapped him out from his anger, but Wu Yang’s eyes flew open to stare darkly at his companion. “Relax,” He spoke in between gritted teeth, “I know how to behave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was another day where he found himself suffering at the hands of Bai Yunfei. The first time he had fallen to him, it was when he was knocked out. And this time, he had lost several of his more precious treasures…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he let that go!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there wasn’t anything else he could use to bet with Bai Yunfei right now….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The things he had betted with and lost were his own personal ‘stock’ and were dispensable, even if it hurt to lose them. The rest of his stuff were far more precious and couldn’t be used in a bet. That much, Wu Yang was aware of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that Wu Yang hadn’t forgotten about that gave his calm companion some measure of relief. He hadn’t interfered with Wu Yang’s gambling since there hadn’t been a need so far, but if things got a bit too out of hand, he was there as both a friend and bodyguard to ensure that it wouldn’t continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep in thought, Wu Yang sat still for a moment before ultimately shooting up from his seat. “We’re leaving!” He spoke to his companion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was leaving! This time, Bai Yunfei was the surprised one. “What? Are you not going to stick around and play some more, fourth prince?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was answered with a heavy glare, “Don’t patronize me. You’ve already won plenty off me, that should be enough. I’ll pay you back twofold for this one day!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And with that, he whirled around and left the room and quickly out of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had to admit, he was a little disappointed. He hadn’t thought that the fourth prince would leave so soon, he still wanted to win a little bit more….but then he scolded himself. Winning so many times was already a good thing, being greedy for more wasn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>

There had to be almost a thousand of them, meaning roughly ten high-grade primal stones! He had been so focused on his bets with Wu Yang that he hadn’t noticed that he won so many primal stones from the other six people there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked to Zheng Kai next to him, “Brother Zheng, we should leave as well. We have to be at the academy tomorrow after all. It’s always good to stop when one’s ahead after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Kai lost a good amount of primal stones himself, but the fact that Bai Yunfei had straight up slaughtered Wu Yang in their bets had been more than enough to wipe his own losses from his mind. A bit reluctant to leave, Zheng Kai acquiesced, “Alright then. If you don’t want to keep playing, let’s leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mu Youqian took that moment to speak up then, “Haha, in that case, let’s adjourn here for tonight. I had more than enough excitement for one night, haha! Instructor Bai, your luck is astounding! The primal stones I won today were all completely taken in by you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei had the courtesy to look embarrassed, “It’s just luck, that’s all. Luck was looking out for me today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As everyone was preparing to leave, a voice suddenly called out to him, “Hold on!! I want to make a bet with you!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pausing, everyone turned around to look at who spoke. It was the twenty-something year old young man in black to the right. Both of his fists were clenched tightly as he stared hatefully at the spot in front of him in dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had clearly lost most of his things. And unfortunately for him, he didn’t have Wu Yang’s tact to leave before it was too late, so he had lost it all almost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friend, gambling has always been something that is fun in small amounts and harmful in big amounts. Betting too much is just as bad as betting too little. With your bad luck, I think you should give up for tonight.” The gray-robed uncle shook his head, trying to calm down the other person.</span></p>

My luck can’t be bad today! I won a great amount a while ago, I can still turn this around! Let’s go again!!” The young man snarled, adamant that he could still win back what he had lost.</span></p>

Losing a dreadful amount of their possession tend to affect their cognitive abilities. The more they gambled, the more they lost. And then in the end, they’d have nothing left….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the person in charge of this place, Jin Manlou chose then to speak up, “Friend, this session is done for today. Let us leave and let this matter wait for another time. You already have nothing left to gamble with….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who says I don’t?!” A scarlet streak ran across the young man’s face. Determined to win back everything he lost today, the man shook his right hand to bring out a pile of things onto the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single person found it hard to hide their exasperation from their faces. The objects he took out wasn’t exactly precious, but….they were all just miscellaneous goods. A few low-grade primal stones, a few soul armaments--the highest quality one being a low-earth and most of them being human-tier ones even--there were also a few class three and four soulgems. There were also a few ordinary herbs and plants and a few precious materials….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man had definitely lost it all. However much he started out with today, it was clear to see that he had squandered even his family’s fortune….</span></p>

Bet with me one last time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sighed. As a soul cultivator, he should have some semblance of self-dignity. Even if he was the son of a wealthy family, it was shameful how he was acting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But ultimately, even soul cultivators are human in the end. They had human-like characteristics, being human themselves, and losing so much from gambling, whether it be money or treasure, was something that’d be hard to accept. Primal stones were specially precious to every soul cultivator. To lose so many of those to the point of complete regret and the loss of rationality was something that could even be said to be normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The miscellaneous goods he brought out weren’t something any of the people here wanted to even look at. Jin Manlou was about to repeat himself when Bai Yunfei’s eyes flickered with suspicion. Hurriedly, he spoke up, “Alright, I’ll bet with you one more round.”</span></p>
