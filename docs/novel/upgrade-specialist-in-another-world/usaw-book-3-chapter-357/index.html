 <p>Chapter 357: Expulsion</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei really didn’t want to cause trouble while on school grounds. Having known that trouble would break out if they were to meet, Bai Yunfei had been determined to avoid the Glacial School during their visit, so he could avoid tarnishing the Crafting School’s name and reputation.</p>
 <p>If Zhang Zhenshan was the first to strike without at all letting up, then Bai Yunfei would by all means spare no feelings while dealing with him!</p>
 <p><em>“You’re taking revenge for your son. You’ve gone mad for your son, and now you want your son back? Where do you get off being a paragon of virtue!? How hilarious!! Zhang Yang was your only son, sure, but what about the ones he killed? Didn’t they have family too!? I was dragged into the Coliseum for no reason at all. Where is the fairness in that!?</em></p>
 <p><em>“Your son deserved to die!!”&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The utter madness behind Zhang Zhenshan’s barrage had finally whittled away at Bai Yunfei’s patience. Like the spark to a fuse, Bai Yunfei couldn’t hold his anger back any longer. After an unceremonious blow that sent Zhang Zhenshan back, Bai Yunfei followed up with a throat strike with his Fire-tipped Spear!</p>
 <p>“Sure, by killing your son, we’ve become eternal enemies, but if you’re going to go crazy… just die then!”</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, stop!!”</p>
 <p>Just before the Fire-tipped Spear was past the point of no return, someone’s voice suddenly shouted at him.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, a mysterious power pulled at his spear, causing it to slip from its intended path.</p>
 <p>“Tzzk!!”</p>
 <p>Rather than into Zhang Zhenshan’s throat as intended, the spear was deposited into the ground next to the man. Having turned red-hot at the tip due to Bai Yunfei’s soulforce, the temperature the spear was giving off started to burn Zhang Zhenshan’s nearby strands of hair.</p>
 <p>Having nearly died by the hands of Bai Yunfei, Zhang Zhenshan’s body froze. His lost rationality was coming back to him now, giving him enough brainpower to look up at Bai Yunfei in a daze.</p>
 <p>The light in Bai Yunfei’s eyes slightly flickered when he realized who had spoken to him. After making the Fire-tipped Spear vanish, Bai Yunfei turned to greet Kou Changkong with a bow, “Senior brother…”</p>
 <p>“Yunfei, what happened here?” A confused look was on Kou Changkong’s face. Just a few minutes ago, he was in the Main Point taking care of some internal matters when several students started to report to him that Bai Yunfei was in the middle of some trouble.</p>
 <p>Putting aside whatever he was doing at the time, he flew straight to where Bai Yunfei was just in time to see Bai Yunfei about to put a spear through the person on the ground.</p>
 <p>Whatever the reason Bai Yunfei had for his actions, Kou Changkong was still the presiding headmaster of the Crafting School. He saw fit to interfere in the matter before it was too late.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster.” Li Tiechui bowed to the headmaster before relaying what he had seen to him.</p>
 <p>“The Glacial School from the Azure Cloud Province?” Kou Changkong repeated with some surprise.</p>
 <p>Back when they were accepting new students, the Crafting School had investigated each individual to avoid accepting any spies or untrustworthy individuals.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s background had been made known to Kou Changkong.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t the Glacial School the one mentioned in the reports for having chased Bai Yunfei across the Azure Cloud Province with the intent to kill?</p>
 <p>“That man there, is he not called Zhang Zhenshan?” Kou Changkong pointed at the one lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>“He is indeed Zhang Zhenshan, headmaster, but how did you…”</p>
 <p>Li Tiechui was surprised Kou Changkong knew about them. Li Tiechui had been handling the people from the Glacial School; he hadn’t even made a report to the headmaster, yet Zhang Zhenshan’s name was known to him already?</p>
 <p>“I see now…” A light of realization went off in Kou Changkong’s head as he pieced together the reasons behind this disturbance.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei,” he raised a head to Bai Yunfei, “how do you plan to deal with the Glacial School? This is your business, so you should decide. If you decide to kill them, I won’t stop you.”</p>
 <p>Considering his position as the headmaster, Kou Changkong shouldn’t be relegating the task to Bai Yunfei. Even more so when they were talking about killing a guest on their school grounds. No matter how good of reason they had for it, killing guests who came to their school for a request would still reflect badly on them. As the headmaster, he should be trying to mediate the matter with peaceful methods rather than violent ones.</p>
 <p>Since Bai Yunfei was involved… some leeway could be given. Kou Changkong knew of the external circumstances behind this argument and the grudges the two had for each other. As things were, it was best to resolve it here and now and let Bai Yunfei be the one to do so.</p>
 <p>This was the decision Kou Changkong had arrived at after thinking over the possibilities.</p>
 <p>If Xiao Binzi had arrived instead, he would’ve just let Bai Yunfei kill the man and be done with it, especially with how protective he was about school.</p>
 <p>Yu Fei broke into a cold sweat when he heard Kou Changkong’s words. His face was as pale as parchment. From when Zhang Zhenshan started to attack Bai Yunfei with a crazed frenzy to when Bai Yunfei beat him back with unbelievable strength to when Zhang Zhenshan was nearly killed by the same boy, Yu Fei hadn’t been able to lift even a finger! Even when Zhang Zhenshan was about to be killed, he didn’t dare to move!</p>
 <p>Thus, he let out a sigh of relief when Kou Changkong arrived just in time to stop Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>However, his next words led to the man sucking in his breath again!</p>
 <p>What was just as shocking was how Bai Yunfei addressed the man.</p>
 <p>He clearly heard Li Tiechui say that this man was the headmaster of the Crafting School, but Bai Yunfei had called such a man his… senior brother!?</p>
 <p><em>“He’s… he’s the junior brother of the headmaster of the Crafting School!!”</em> That was the realization Yu Fei came to. Like tidal waves, shock washed over his mind in droves as he tried to snap himself out of this delusional dream.</p>
 <p>The person he had once pursued and tried to kill… was the junior brother of the Crafting School!</p>
 <p>The plan he had once thought up had him trying to attack such a powerful individual!</p>
 <p>Didn’t this mean that the information they so desperately wanted to interrogate and torture from Bai Yunfei’s mind was a ‘secret’ of the Crafting School!?</p>
 <p>The final words Kou Changkong said was the final nail to his coffin. His mind wasn’t even back to operational functionality, yet it felt as though all of his organs were starting to fail him!</p>
 <p>Countless of kilometers had been traveled for the sake of reaching the Crafting School. He was hoping to have a soul armament crafted for his son and to hopefully gain some power for the school.</p>
 <p>With how things were progressing, would they end up dying here at the end of their journey??</p>
 <p>“....”</p>
 <p>Poised with such a challenge, Bai Yunfei could only narrow his eyes as he tried to make his choice. Kou Changkong had already given his approval, but Bai Yunfei was still hesitant to do anything.</p>
 <p>The grudges of his past or the reputation of his school?</p>
 <p>How should he choose?</p>
 <p>“The Glacial School is a subsidiary of our Beast Taming School. Would it perhaps be possible to show my school some face and be merciful?”</p>
 <p>The voice of another caused Bai Yunfei to turn around. He saw two people walking over to them.</p>
 <p>It was the junior headmaster of the Beast Taming School, Lin Dongxiao, with his fellow companion, Mo Ni.</p>
 <p>His sudden request made Yu Fei happy beyond belief.</p>
 <p>The seedling of hope was starting to sprout in him.</p>
 <p>Now that another ‘outsider’ was thrown into the equation, Bai Yunfei was beside himself now.</p>
 <p>Killing them all would be rather difficult now, so Bai Yunfei raised his head to look at Kou Changkong, “Senior, I…”</p>
 <p>“Die!!”</p>
 <p>The moment he looked up, the previously motionless Zhang Zhenshan below him exploded up. With vitriol hatred in his eyes, his hand flew like a sword to stab Bai Yunfei’s throat!</p>
 <p>His sudden movements alarmed everyone and caused a furious glint to appear in Kou Changkong’s eyes. His soulforce spiked before immediately dying back down.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had already made his move.</p>
 <p>“Hmph!” Disdain for the man was all too apparent in Bai Yunfei’s snort. Any sudden movements from Zhang Zhenshan would be immediately tracked by Bai Yunfei’s soulforce, making any attempts at a sneak attack was virtually pointless.</p>
 <p>Kicking viciously, Bai Yunfei sent the man flying with a thwack. The man spit out yet another mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>Despite how similar this hopeless situation was to before, Zhang Zhenshan continued to try and attack Bai Yunfei with an unrelenting barrage of anger!</p>
 <p>“Zhang Zhenshan!!”</p>
 <p>Another furious roar.</p>
 <p>This time, it was Yu Fei, the headmaster of the Glacial School that yelled out.</p>
 <p>Yu Fei stared at Zhang Zhenshan fearfully, and he looked as though he was having a furious mental debate between regret and fear. Before he stopped from saying anything more, he said.</p>
 <p>“Zhang Zhenshan! Don’t drag the Glacial School past the point of no return with your personal vendettas! If you so wish to act on your vengeful desires, then I hereby announce… that you are expelled from the Glacial School!!</p>
 <p>From henceforth, whatever you do will have nothing to do with my Glacial School! Should you die, our school will have nothing to do with it!"</p>
