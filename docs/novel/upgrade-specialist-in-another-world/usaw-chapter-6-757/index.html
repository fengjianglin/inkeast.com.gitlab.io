<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man hiding behind the two boulders made for a rather comedic sight with how his head was a size bigger than average. This was the the leader of the ‘Hornets of Plum Valley’, the Boss Hornet, Yi Feijian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twice had the two met before. First was back in Vacancy Inn back when ‘Rapist Hornet’ tried to do away with Huangfu Rui. The entire group had been taught a quick lesson and forced to flee the inn, but the lesson hadn’t been too harsh since they all managed to get away in one piece. Bai Yunfei and the group hadn’t even really bothered to keep them in mind, and it only took a few days before the Hornets were forgotten completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the second time they met was what made Bai Yunfei really furious with them. It was back in Formagua City when they met Huangfu Rui during their escape. Once again, the group tried to do away with Huangfu Rui before being attacked and killed. Even though Huangfu Rui wasn’t hurt, Bai Yunfei was still furious with the group anyhow and vowed to kill every single last one of them if they met again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From what they heard from Huangfu Rui near Formagua City, several of the Hornets corpses were there where Huangfu Rui fought, but there was still one person left unaccounted for from her story. Huangfu Rui didn’t say anything about the big-headed person, and so Bai Yunfei figured that the person somehow managed to escape with his life during that event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So never did he think that he’d meet ‘Boss Hornet’ here of all places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flicker of light crossed Boss Hornet’s eyes, prompting Bai Yunfei to smile in warning. “It’s best that you don’t do anything unwise, else I won’t mind breaking one of your legs or arms before asking my question.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boss Hornet stopped almost immediately, his body shivering at the threat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His courage was all but gone now. He hadn’t seen how strong Bai Yunfei really was back in Vacancy Inn, but now he had truly seen what power Bai Yunfei had after the fight less than a minute ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei was a figure far more powerful than he was, and it was possible Bai Yunfei was at the limits of what a Soul Exalt was capable of. In his many years of wandering the continent, Boss Hornet had seen many weaklings and was always vicious to them when possible. On the inverse, he was also always afraid of those stronger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like a balloon, his courage deflated away from his person as he took two staggered steps backwards to lean against the boulder. “If I answer your questions, will you spare my life?” He asked, tired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His question was very appropriate for his situation, but the regret he was feeling right now was enough to turn his intestines green. If only he had not thought that he could benefit from waiting for Bai Yunfei’s fight to finish. He figured either Bai Yunfei or the other side would be killed, and the other side far too tired to fight back against him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But reality had other plans, and it was too late now. If only he had known, he would’ve ran away sooner instead of staying behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had ventured into the tiger’s den hoping for treasure and met with the tiger. What a blunder. What a terrible blunder indeed….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei leapt right in front of him and measured him up with one quick glance. “As long as you answer my questions, I will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That got his attention. “On your word then! As long as you spare my life, I’ll tell you some very useful information! It relates to the Extreme King Pills!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He gave out his bargaining chip at once. It was his best chance to survive and was also very important and relevant information anyone here would want to hear, hence why they were in this pocket to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Bai Yunfei perked an eyebrow, not expecting to hear such a line. He smiled. “As long as you can answer my questions you may leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then as you say….” Boss Hornet replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei cut into his words before he finished. “Were you or were you not near Formagua City in the past week or so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that Bai Yunfei looked completely indifferent to potentially hearing about something regarding the Extreme King Pills was astounding to Boss Hornet. His lips twitched a bit at the ridiculousness of the situation, but he hadn’t the power to say anything about it in fear of angering Bai Yunfei. He nodded, “I was. My brothers and I made the mistake of entering Formagua City and was attacked by some kind of terrifying soulbeast there. Several of my brothers were killed underneath, and the others above ground. I….I’m the last survivor….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just thinking about the name ‘Formagua City’ brought back terrible memories of what happened then. How several more of his brothers had died trying to get back at a young girl there. Just thinking about it made him want to howl with distress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei didn’t care at all for the look on Boss Hornet’s face. “When you escaped Formagua City, did you head towards the mountains to the south?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lips of Boss Hornet twitched as if bracing himself for impact, “Yes…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then surely you must’ve seen my young sister, correct?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That….I didn’t do a thing to her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you or did you not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When your brothers came out, you must’ve been the last to show up? And when they were killed, did you see it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? Ye—yes….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One question at a time, Bai Yunfei’s eyes were glowing with increasing intensity now. Now was the time for him to ask the most important question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then did you see the one who killed your brothers? And did you or did you not see what he did to my young sister?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boss Hornet blinked. He didn’t expect things to progress like this. His eyes narrowed with concentration as he tried to think about what really did happen that day. But when Bai Yunfei’s eyes were seemingly staring deep into his own, the man shivered and tried to ignore everything else to think. “I….I remember seeing a middle-aged man appear, but….it was dark that day, so I didn’t see what he looked like. And….I ran away before he did anything….so I didn’t see what he was doing to the little girl….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more he spoke, the more panicked he started to feel. Boss Hornet knew that this was a worthless answer as far as Bai Yunfei was concerned. It was the same as not answering Bai Yunfei’s questions, which in turn meant his life was still in jeopardy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh…” But much to his surprise, Bai Yunfei didn’t look as disappointed as he thought. It was almost as if Bai Yunfei was expecting him to answer that way. He didn’t say anything more after that ‘oh’ and chose to think to himself about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not knowing what in the world Bai Yunfei was thinking about, Boss Hornet started to worry. Him having to wait was driving him to madness, and his eyes were already shaking somewhat as he tried to think about what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, tell me what you know about the Extreme King Pills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At last, Bai Yunfei broke his silence to speak to Boss Hornet, causing him to leap with fright at the suddenness. “I...I can tell you where the Extreme King Pills are!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up, “You know about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do.” Boss Hornet nodded. “I saw the mountain where the Extreme King Pills are located next to a while ago outside the pocket.
