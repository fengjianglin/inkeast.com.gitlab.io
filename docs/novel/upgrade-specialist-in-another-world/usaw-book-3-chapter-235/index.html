 <p>Chapter 235: The Lightning-fire Cauldron and the Violet Soul Ring!!</p>
 <p>The Lightning-fire Cauldron was about as tall as Bai Yunfei and reached nearly two meters in length. Its make was rather simple; perhaps even slightly old-fashioned. The cauldron was entirely crimson in color and exuded a red light with a slight trace of violet-colored lightning that crackled just almost out from sight in it.</p>
 <p>“The cauldron was constructed with plenty of changeling stones, allowing the cauldron’s dimensions to be changed as you will. This way, spear-shaped soul armaments can be made with this cauldron without a problem.” Zi Jin said. Waving his hand again, a strand of elemental fire flowed from his body to the cauldron and lit it</p>
 <p>And right in front of their very eyes, the bottom of the cauldron began to transform to take on the shape of a mold for a long spear.</p>
 <p>Smiling when he saw the bright-eyed Bai Yunfei, Zi Jin said, “Transmit your soulforce into it and the cauldron will change its shape as you will it. Yunfei, give it a try.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei replied at once. Striding forward to give it a try, he sucked in a deep breath and put his right hand onto the cauldron in an attempt to try and change the cauldron’s shape.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Author Note: In order to avoid any confusion again, please allow me to explain this once more: An increase in percentage is merely that, an increase in percentage. For example, if the chance of success is 20%, then an increase of 200% makes this chance become 60%. A chance of success over 100% obviously means that each attempt will end in a success. I hope this clears things up for everyone.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up at the notification. He knew that this notification would pop up so he hadn’t been too surprised when it did. He acknowledged the notification and then allowed for it to disappear before he started to change the shape of the cauldron as Zi Jin instructed him too.</p>
 <p>There was a faint crackling sound as the cauldron started to revert back to its normal shape.</p>
 <p>Zi Jin nodded his head in satisfaction at the sight. He seemed to have muttered something to himself under his breath as he said, “Since I’m giving you this cauldron, allow me to give you another gift for your apprenticeship! Yunfei, this space ring has accompanied your master for almost a hundred years. Take it, it’s yours now!”</p>
 <p>And with that, Zi Jin took out a space ring that was colored just slightly violet from his left hand. With a wave, the space ring was flown over to where Bai Yunfei before neatly falling on top of Bai Yunfei’s palm.</p>
 <p>“Master, this…”</p>
 <p>Zi Jin smiled, “It’s named a ‘violet soul ring’. As a soul armament, it is an exceedingly rare item. Take it, you’ll see that it’ll be a great deal of help to you as you are.”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Bai Yunfei said in confusion; his eyes hovered onto the space ring and watched as the notification popped up in his head.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">

   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>Bai Yunfei wasn't prepared for this.</p>
 <p>His eyes grew wide, and the look of shock on his face was impossible to mask.</p>
 <p>“How is it, Yunfei, can you tell how special the ring is?” Zi Jin misunderstood the reason why Bai Yunfei was shocked and said, “This violet soul ring is something I crafted by accident in the past. Even as one of the accessory related soul armaments, this one is unique as it can store space affinity soul armaments in it.”</p>
 <p>Snapping back to awareness, Bai Yunfei forced the shock in his chest back down and asked, “Master, this….this accessory type soul armament, would I be able to craft such a thing?”</p>
 <p>After searching for so long, Bai Yunfei had finally found an accessory that could grant him an attribute before being upgraded!! His conjectures in the past were correct then, soul armaments like this really existed….</p>
 <p>Zi Jin nodded his head to respond to Bai Yunfei, “You can, but that requires a completely different set of methods. But those type of things can only be made into soul armaments in very rare occurrences. A good majority of the accessories made remain as normal item ware despite the materials that are wasted in making them….You’ve not a chance to craft them yet. In time, I will teach you the art.”</p>
 <p>Zi Jin waved his right hand again, allowing for all sorts of ingredients to pile up from the side. “Well then. Yunfei, use the cauldron and craft a soul armament for me to see.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Without hesitation, Bai Yunfei placed the ring away in his robes and sucked in a deep breath of air. Solemnly, he looked at the pile of ingredients and stuck his right hand out. Bending all five fingers, he had several ingredients come flying to his hand.</p>
 <p>The ability in making things fly was something he learned how to do now, but it wasn’t at a level where it could be used for battle.</p>
 <p>Inserting the fire attribute vermiculite into the cauldron, Bai Yunfei pushed his soulforce into the cauldron, causing it to light up with a bang.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Two hours later.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>There was a muffled explosion from within the cauldron, causing Bai Yunfei’s face to pale drastically. The ingredients was being burnt away right in front of his very eyes; he had been doing well just a moment ago, but then this failure had happened straight away!</p>
 <p>“Haha, Yunfei, don’t feel discouraged. This happens normally when crafting. Try again.” Zi Jin laughed as if not blaming Bai Yunfei for his mistakes.</p>
 <p>“Yes, master.” Bai Yunfei spoke. Wiping away his inner thoughts, Bai Yunfei calmed down and tried again to craft a soul armament.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Roughly half a day later, a bright-red sword came flying out from the cauldron and into Bai Yunfei’s hand.</p>
 <table border="1px solid #000000" style="background-color: #000b28; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #000000; width: initial; height: initial; margin: 0px auto 25px">
  <tbody>
   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong><strong>Equipment Grade: High Human <br>Elemental Affinity: Fire <br>Attack: 483 <br>Soul Compatibility: 5% <br>Upgrade Requirement: 88 Soulpoints</strong></strong></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>It was still a high-human tier soul armament, but the attack was just a little bit away from making the soul armament an earth tier soul armament….</p>
 <p>Looking at the soul armament in his hand, Bai Yunfei looked slightly disappointed.</p>
 <p>But there was a look of satisfaction in Zi Jin’s eyes when he nodded his head. “Very good. This is much closer to being an earth tier soul armament. Yunfei, your talent in crafting is truly rare beyond rare. Even your senior Jiang Fan wasn’t as talented as you were at your age….”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei sighed nonetheless, “But, I wasn’t able to craft an earth tier soul armament….”</p>
 <p>Starting just a bit, Zi Jin laughed, “So you’re not happy with your results?”</p>
 <p>“Now that your student is a Soul Ancestor, should an earth tier soul armament not be expected?”</p>
 <p>“Do you think that being able to craft an earth tier soul armament is as easy as crafting a human tier soul armament?” Zi Jin shook his head lightly. “Soul Ancestors being able to craft an earth tier soul armament is true alright, but it isn’t iron-clad. You only just became one, there’s plenty of techniques you’ve yet to learn, and the ingredients for making one could use some changes.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve condensed the ingredients roughly eight hundred times, though your application of the ‘three revolutions per rotation’ technique wasn’t all that bad, but it isn’t the most optimal one for these ingredients. Instead, you should….”</p>
 <p>Carefully, Zi Jin explained to Bai Yunfei step by step several techniques for what to do with the ingredients while Bai Yunfei paid close attention to each and every word said to him.</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>I’ll give you a demonstration. Pay close attention to when I change the intensity of the flames….”</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>For the entire day, Bai Yunfei learned in earnest under Zi Jin’s practiced hand. Zi Jin’s explanations were exceedingly detailed and helped Bai Yunfei step into a whole new world about the applications for the craft and answering any other questions he had. In a single day, he felt as if he learned much more than he’d regularly learn than if he practiced by himself for tens of days.</p>
 <p>In that day, he made four more soul armaments and succeeded in making two. Both of which were exceedingly close on being earth tier armaments, but he wasn’t able to make it over that one small line in between the two tiers.</p>
 <p>That night after Bai Yunfei returned to his room...</p>
 <p>After learning for the entire day, Bai Yunfei wasn’t in a hurry to craft any more. So instead, he sat down on his bed and began to think about several things.</p>
 <p>The violet soul ring fell onto his hand.</p>
 <p><em>“Upgrade.”</em> Bai Yunfei thought.</p>
 <p>……</p>
