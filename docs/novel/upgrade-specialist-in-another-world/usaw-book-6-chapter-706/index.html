Even as a Soul Exalt, he was powerless to completely resist the constrictive force acting upon him. As the tentacles tightened even more around him, Bai Yunfei started to grunt with pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What dreadful power....this octopus really is a peak late-stage class six soulbeast. It's even stronger than a class seven when underwater!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei's face was grim. His entire body was trembling a bit as he tried to resist the pressure on him. He gritted his teeth, trying his best to escape from the grasp of the tentacles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even as he was trying to gather up his soulforce, the tentacles around his body started to glow with a faint black light! Wrapped around Bai Yunfei's body, the tentacles seemingly started to bulge a bit. A crack opened up on the side of the tentacle facing Bai Yunfei, looking almost like an actual mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The suction pads on the tentacle spat out a wisp of black light before they shrunk back down to their normal size to stick to Bai Yunfei!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Urgh...."</span></p>

For once, there was actual fear in his eyes! The soulforce he had been gathering had suddenly....disappeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Or in better words, drained away!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at the same time, the black light shining from the tentacle around him grew brighter, and the tentacle grew tighter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei realized then—this tentacle was draining his soulforce!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To add onto that, Bai Yunfei felt slightly dizzy with his soulforce being drained. His face was paling, and even his blood started to have a strange flow to it! Like his soulforce, a great amount of his blood was coming out from his body and pass his clothes to be sucked into the tentacles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was this tentacle draining soulforce, it was draining blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"This...." Bai Yunfei started to speak. He never thought that the octopus would be capable of something like this too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Damn!" Realizing his blunder, Bai Yunfei began to fight off the force acting upon him, "Xiao Qi!!" He called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Chirp!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a piercing trill that sounded through even the waters from Xiao Qi. Following that trill, a series of ripples through the water could be seen bursting outwards! Xiao Qi couldn't attack the octopus with Bai Yunfei, so he did the next best thing—a soul attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wuuu....."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a low-sounding gurgle from the octopus. It flashed with a faint blue light several times as the soul attack started to wreck havoc on it. Just barely, Bai Yunfei could sense the tentacle around him start to loosen up under the influence of the soul attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even with that soul attack....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn't do any significant harm to the octopus!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph!" As surprised as he was by the octopus' might, Bai Yunfei gritted his teeth and began to send soulforce into his Flameblade Bracer the moment he felt the tentacle loosen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the cracks between the tentacles shined a bright red light. It shined out from where the tentacles failed to latch onto and started to burn and sizzle at the parts of the tentacle touching it. Being burnt by the light, the tentacles around Bai Yunfei started to loosen up again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bang!!" At last, the tentacles could hold it no longer and were forced away from Bai Yunfei. An intense flame shot out from the right side of Bai Yunfei's arm to form a giant blade to go onwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Whoosh!" The flames blossomed in the waters for only a moment before it disappeared. There was a brilliant scorch mark all over the tentacle around Bai Yunfei, expelling a dark shade of blood out from the wounds and adding to the murkiness of the water around Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wuuuu....." Finally, there was a distinct sound of pain from the tentacle. As if experiencing some sort of tremendous pain, the tentacle withdrew its tentacle away from Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at the same time, another ten tentacles came forward to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei's breathing was a little labored. The crisis he was in a moment ago hadn't been a very painful one in the physical sense, but a great deal of soulforce and blood had been lost due to his negligence. His face was showing signs of blood loss as well, and his body was slightly red from being constricted. Thankfully, his armor had protected him to a certain degree, but the part of his robes around his arms and legs were dyed with a red tint—it was the result of the blood the octopus sprayed at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking two heavy breaths, Bai Yunfei immediately retreated away from the octopus with the Flash Steps. He dodged the several tentacles coming at him and bent his body just slightly. Both his arms came up in a cross formation as a shining blue tentacle came forward to slam onto him. &nbsp; It connected with a bang, and Bai Yunfei was forced back a bit due to the blow. Though he managed to come out from the blow with only an aching pain in his arms, Bai Yunfei was helpless to stop himself from being thrust forwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bang! Bang! Bang...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were several colliding sounds as Bai Yunfei was sent flying back and forth like a ping pong ball from being hit by the many tentacles. Each time he was hit, there was a pained look on Bai Yunfei's face, though he managed to divert his trajectory in a 'Z' formation towards the octopus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When another tentacle slammed painfully onto his back, Bai Yunfei felt as if his internal organs would burst. Suppressing a grunt, he gritted his teeth and shot forward. Looking ahead, Bai Yunfei's eyes caught notice of something and immediately straightened his body in response to it. Exploding with soulforce, he clenched his left fist tightly so that golden light started to emit from it, and with a powerful spin, he lashed a mighty punch onto an incoming tentacle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Bang!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bai Yunfei's left hand practically embedded itself into the tentacle's flesh as he punched it. From where his fist touched the tentacle, there was a deep impression of it that only got deeper as time went on. Again and again, the impression grew even deeper before finally, the tentacle exploded with a bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not at all caring for the extent of the damage he'd do to the octopus, Bai Yunfei borrowed the explosive power of his move to fly twenty-thirty meters away out of the 'dangerous' zone of the octopus' tentacles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All there was left now was just fifty meters before he'd be right in front of the octopus!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The octopus had been so immersed in trying to thrash Bai Yunfei with its tentacles that it had been almost far too late when it realized Bai Yunfei was out of the 'blood zone'. Furious, another ten tentacles came forward to try and corral Bai Yunfei back into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Hmph!" Bai Yunfei sneered. He placed the Fire-tipped Spear back into his ring and crossed his arms in front of his chest again. Lighting up in a crimson-red light, Bai Yunfei's essence fireseed began to export a large amount of elemental fire from Bai Yunfei's body. Bringing out both arms in front of him, Bai Yunfei unleashed a two-meter large ball of elemental fire into the water. Like a miniature sun, the ball traveled through the waters before expanding in size when it got close to the tentacles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Booom!!!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if a volcano was erupting, there was a tremendous explosion from underneath the waters as red and blue light shot up into the air. There was a slight tint of purple light to be seen amidst the explosion, spiraling throughout the explosion like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Wuu!!" Came the shrill grumble of the octopus. Its gigantic frame trembled underwater for a moment before it brought its several tentacles back to its body. Most of the tentacles were charred black, and some of them had parts of their flesh blasted straight off.</span></p>

The brilliant gleam of lights from the explosion was no longer there as well. Bai Yunfei stood at the edge of where the explosion took place to stare at the mountain-sized soulbeast with a curious light. "An octopus that can suck blood and soulforce.....I think there was a deviant type called the 'blood octopus'...."</span></p>

They had low intelligence but were especially prone to killing and were supposedly said to be extinct by now. So it was surprising for Bai Yunfei to come across one here.</span></p>

And why haven't they shown up yet?"</span></p>

The destruction that had been invited into Formagua City was definitely due to the hands of a soul cultivator. This blood octopus had a master. But where was this master now? After battling with the blood octopus for so long, it was suspicious that no one had come to see what was going on yet.</span></p>

Let's just first kill the blood octopus. And if that person doesn't come then, then forget about it! Someone who can do something like this isn't any ordinary person anyways. If that person ends up being too strong, then it's only going to end up dangerous for me...."&nbsp;</span></p>

Stepping forward, Bai Yunfei shot forward like an arrow to charge at the blood octopus. As he charged forward, his left hand came forward to have the Charm Bracelet send a beam of light towards the octopus!</span></p>

His entire figure was shining bright red and his face couldn't be seen. &nbsp;It seemed that he was in the middle of training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire person trembled slightly.

It's him! Bai Yunfei!! Bai Yunfei!!!" As if pumped full with adrenaline, the man started to tremble heavily. A terrifying aura started to exude out from his body, shattering the many bones into tiny fragments and dust around him!</span></p>
