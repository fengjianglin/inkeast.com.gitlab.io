 <p>Chapter 246: Life Jade Slip</p>
 <p>Song Lin walked into the caves at a swift pace. Before Bai Yunfei could even ask what was going on, Song Lin spoke with a grim expression, “Yunfei. Come with me to the Northern Point, something has happened!”</p>
 <p>This was the very first time Bai Yunfei had seen such a grim look on Song Lin’s face. Pausing for a moment in his surprise, Bai Yunfei then asked, “Brother Song, what happened?”</p>
 <p>“We can talk later. Just come with me for now. The master and the other elders are waiting for you right now.” Song Lin spoke before whirling around to speed walk out of the cave.</p>
 <p>Unwilling to be the slower one, Bai Yunfei quickly packed away his cauldron before chasing after Song Lin.</p>
 <p>In no time at all, the two made their way to the main point before heading to the Northern Point. Arriving at a never before seen courtyard, Bai Yunfei and Song Lin walked into the building and headed to the middlemost room. Kou Changkong, first elder, second elder, and even Zi Jin had gathered in the room already with sour faces as they spoke to one another.</p>
 <p>“Master, I’ve arrived.” Song Lin bowed as soon as he came into proximity with them before moving to the side.</p>
 <p>“Yunfei pays his respects to master, senior, and the elders.” Bai Yunfei bowed as well before then asking, “Master, what in the world as happened?”</p>
 <p>Zi Jin nodded his head to accept the greeting. “Yunfei, your third senior has come across trouble.”</p>
 <p>“Third senior?” At first, Bai Yunfei was confused whom they were talking about, but then the answer came to him. “Ah, senior Jiang Fan!? What happened to him?”</p>
 <p>Ever since Bai Yunfei had first learned who had saved him in the past, he had spent days trying to figure out how to explain the temporal ‘discrepancy’ about when he had joined the Crafting School. Almost half a year had gone by since he had joined the Crafting School, but not once had he seen Jiang Fan. It came as a complete surprise to hear that something happened to Jiang Fan today out of the blue.</p>
 <p>“We’re not sure of the details yet, but Jiang Fan is in some sort of predicament. One that might potentially be fatal.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Bai Yunfei didn’t know what to think at that; Jiang Fan was in danger?</p>
 <p>As if to answer Bai Yunfei’s confusion, Zi Jin took out a jade slip that was about the length of his arm. It was crystalline in structure, but there was a faint flame that twinkled within its body. The flame was faint red in color and had a rhythmic pulsation to it like it was a heart.</p>
 <p>While the bottom of the slip was flashing red in light, the top part of the slip was almost without light.</p>
 <p>“This soul armament is called a ‘life jade slip.’ By crafting with very particular materials, it can reflect the health of a person, as the name implies. The degree in which the light flickers represents the vitality of the master of the soul armament; eighty percent is the general norm, and anything lower than sixty percent means the owner is either seriously hurt or is in imminent danger. If the jade slip shatters, then that means the owner has died.” Zi Jin explained at once. “This jade slip is linked to Jiang Fan…”</p>
 <p>Right now, this jade slip was at fifty percent, meaning the situation Jiang Fan was in didn’t need to be said.</p>
 <p>This was the very first time Bai Yunfei had heard of such a ‘magical’ soul armament, so he reached his hand out to hold the jade slip.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>With the jade slip in hand, a string of notifications started to flow into his mind at a moment’s notice.</p>
 <p><em>“Unique equipment… that’s exactly like the upgrade stone!”</em></p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s eyes lit up with surprise as he thought to himself in shock. Schooling his emotions, Bai Yunfei looked back to Zi Jin and asked, “Are we to lend assistance if senior Jiang Fan is in trouble?”</p>
 <p>Zi Jin nodded. “If it was some sort of mistake from his training or a momentary crisis, he’d be fine by the next day, but the slip has shown that he has been growing weaker since last night without any sign of improvement. We fear that he might be in a very dangerous predicament, so we wish to see if we can work something out or provide help.”</p>
 <p>“If master called me here today, that must mean…”</p>
 <p>Zi Jin nodded again, “Correct. Yunfei, you are of the Crafting School and a student of mine. Though there’s plenty of things you’ve not yet been able to attend and plenty more you need to know, Jiang Fan is your senior. This time… I wish for you to go lend a hand to help him.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei had guessed the outcome already, but it was still a surprising realization. Half a year had already passed since he had joined, and even though Bai Yunfei’s strength had increased by leaps and bounds, he was still a weakling if put into the circle of soul cultivators. Jiang Fan was a Soul Exalt himself, and if he were in such danger, what help could Bai Yunfei possibly lend to him?</p>
 <p>Seeing his hesitation, Zi Jin smiled in reassurance. “Haha, you won’t be going by yourself, of course. I’ve already decided to have the first elder lead you and Song Lin. Consider this as a way to gain experience. As long as you follow the first elder’s wishes, your safety will be guaranteed while you’ll learn as much as you can.”</p>
 <p>If the first elder was going, there’d be no problems at all. The first elder was a late-stage Soul King. It was likely that Bai Yunfei wouldn’t have to do anything except learn as much about the world under the safety of the elder’s hand.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the first elder lending assistance meant that Jiang Fan's plight would surely be resolved. Soul Kings were existences that spent their days in training rather than acting on secular issues—even if they were people who held rank as a leading figure of a group or family.</p>
 <p>“Then… when do we leave?” Bai Yunfei asked.</p>
 <p>“Right now!” Xiao Binzi replied.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei said nothing to that.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The group walked out to the middle of the courtyard with Xiao Binzi leading them all. “Your flying soul armament is far too slow, Song Lin. I’ll be carrying the both of you instead!” Xiao Binzi informed Song Lin.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei was taken aback at this; they were going to fly!?</p>
 <p>In one shake of his hand, a greenish-colored light came into sight, followed by a longsword that floated off by his side. As soon as it appeared, the sword started to shake before growing double its width to become a giant sword.</p>
 <p>In a flash, Xiao Binzi stood on top of the sword. “Up!” He commanded the two others.</p>
 <p>Song Lin looked at Bai Yunfei with a smile, “Yunfei, you go up first.”</p>
 <p>When Bai Yunfei saw the green-colored sword underneath Xiao Binzi’s feet, his eyes started to light up as if thinking about something. Nodding his head to Song Lin, Bai Yunfei hopped up to grab onto the sword’s handle with his right hand. Following a twist of his hand, he flipped himself up onto the sword right behind Xiao Binzi.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a high jump. Bai Yunfei just wanted to borrow this chance to touch the sword to learn of its attributes.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <table style="background-color: #000b28;color: #ffffff;border: 1px solid #000000;width: initial;height: initial;margin: 0px auto 25px" border="1px solid #000000">

   <tr style="height: 20px">
    <td style="padding: 15px"><strong><strong>Equipment Grade:&nbsp;Low Heaven<p></p><p>Elemental Affinity: Wind</p><p>Attack: 2639</p><p>Equipment Effect: By transmitting soulforce, flight is capable with this item.</p></strong></strong><p><strong><strong></strong><strong>Upgrade Requirement: 160 Soulpoints</strong></strong></p></td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p></p>
 <p><em>“A low-heaven tier that’s capable of flight…”</em> Bai Yunfei jealously thought. Ever since he had joined the Crafting School, his understanding of the world of cultivators had expanded greatly along with his standards. In the past, a high-human tier soul armament would’ve left him giddy with joy, but now, even a heaven tier soul armament felt like it was becoming more and more common in appearance….</p>
 <p>At the same time, he felt relieved. If the first elder of the Crafting School was using an earth tier soul armament, it’d certainly be a very troubling situation.</p>
 <p>Bai Yunfei’s actions to get on top of the sword were very unnatural, but not a single person paid much attention to him. Song Lin himself leaped off of the ground and landed right behind Bai Yunfei.</p>
 <p>From the side, Kou Changkong gave his warning, “Song Lin, look after Yunfei and don’t be too impulsive.”</p>
 <p>Song Lin nodded his head. “Yes, master!”</p>
 <p>Kou Changkong turned his head to Bai Yunfei next, “Yunfei, follow the first elder and Song Lin. Don’t take any risks!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, senior. I’ll be careful.”</p>
 <p>With a wave of his right hand, Xiao Binzi floated Jiang Fan's jade slip into his palm and let it point where it wanted. East, that was the direction where Jiang Fan would be.</p>
 <p>“The east…” Xiao Binzi pocketed the jade slip, “Make sure to coat yourself in your soulforce. We’re heading out!!”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!!”</p>
 <p>No sooner did he finish speaking than the green sword beneath him explode in a flurry of green light. A bright-green trail immediately formed right behind the sword as it took the three people through the sky...</p>
