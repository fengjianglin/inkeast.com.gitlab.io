 <p>Chapter 406: The Unique Equipment, the Beast Taming Ring! (Tenth)</p>
 <p>There was a strong flash of light from the cauldron before the fire in it was extinguished. Bai Yunfei’s second fireseed soon came flying out with a multicolored bracelet.</p>
 <p>The second fireseed melted back into the Cataclysmic Seal, and the bracelet fell safely onto Bai Yunfei’s hand.</p>
 <p>Now that he had the finished product in his hand, Bai Yunfei couldn’t help but look at the stats straight away.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Straight away, a string of notifications popped up in Bai Yunfei’s mind, but the contents of the notifications surprised him greatly!</p>
 <p><em>“Unique, mid earth, pet loyalty, and 20% soul compatibility!!”</em></p>
 <p>Each line of the notification brought Bai Yunfei’s eyebrow higher and higher. He had no words to describe how he felt about the bracelet.</p>
 <p>He expected an ordinary bracelet with ordinary effects, not a unique piece of equipment with very rare stats!</p>
 <p>Making a low-earth tier soul armament would’ve been good enough for him, but this one surpassed his expectations by being a mid-earth!</p>
 <p>Not to mention he had never seen one of the attributes before!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, it was very surprising to see that the soul compatibility was already at 20%!</p>
 <p>And so, Bai Yunfei was at a loss for words for a very long time. Even with repeated looks at the stats of the bracelet, he didn’t know what to say.</p>
 <p>“Jackpot! I’ve hit the jackpot!” He finally managed to say, <em>“It was so worth it to craft! Using throwaway materials to craft a unique set of equipment, what a deal! I’ve never seen this stat before!</em></p>
 <p><em>“Pet loyalty….pet loyalty….”</em> Bai Yunfei muttered to himself, <em>“Is it something a soulbeast should wear then?”</em></p>
 <p>‘Loyalty’ is a relatively easy concept to explain. The degree of loyalty would differ from soulbeast and soul cultivators, and if the soul cultivator didn’t treat the soulbeast well, then loyalty would drop. While ultimately, the soul contract binded the soulbeast to the soul cultivator, loyalty served as a major influence on how the soulbeast would act.</p>
 <p><em>“If I let a soulbeast wear this, does this mean it’ll be more loyal to me?”</em> Mused Bai Yunfei, <em>“How much is 50 points of loyalty? Is that a lot? How about 100? Does it only work if a soulbeast wears it?”</em></p>
 <p>The question remained on his mind as he stored away the cauldron. Having no answer to it, he decided to turn around to look at Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>“Come here, Xiao Qi.” The way Bai Yunfei beckoned a finger was eerily similar to how a creepy old man might beckon to a child.</p>
 <p>“Chirp chirp~!” Came a naive chirp. Seeing that Bai Yunfei was done, the bird wasted no time in flying to the outstretched hand of his.</p>
 <p>“Try wearing this, Xiao Qi.”</p>
 <p>Pushing some soulforce into the bracelet, Bai Yunfei watched as the bracelet in his left hand start to shrink in size!!</p>
 <p>By adding in a morphing stone during the crafting process, it was possible to change the size of the product by a certain amount.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the bracelet turned into the size of a ping pong ball. While Xiao Qi remained faithfully still, Bai Yunfei slowly eased the bracelet onto its neck. With how multi-colored the bracelet was, it looked quite nice on Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>Appearance didn’t matter much to Bai Yunfei. All he cared about was experimenting with the stats. Though to his amazement, there didn’t seem to be any change when Xiao Qi wore it.</p>
 <p>But from the faint connection he felt with the bracelet, he knew that it was still operating like any other soul armament he owned, meaning that it was ready to be used...</p>
 <p><em>“Strange….is this not how you’re supposed to use it?”</em> He picked the bracelet back up and restore it to its original size to inspect it.</p>
 <p>A new attribute required time to study and learn about. Experimenting or finding out any new effects of a soul armament was one of Bai Yunfei’s great pleasures, so him not finding an answer yet didn’t bother him.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi said nothing, and stared quizzically as always at Bai Yunfei. Flying back to the nest, it folded its wings back up to prepare to sleep. After watching Bai Yunfei craft the entire day, it found itself slightly tired.</p>
 <p>“Let’s try upgrading it! Who knows if a new effect will appear, I can experiment it more then!</p>
 <p>“Upgrade!”</p>
 <p>……</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Once again, Bai Yunfei was surprised to see the item after it was upgraded to +10.</p>
 <p>There was another effect he had never seen before!</p>
 <p>And what other emotion was to be expected after that but joy!</p>
 <p><em>“The soul compatibility is at 60%! That’s at the level of a soulbound armament!”</em></p>
 <p>The more intimate feeling he was getting from the bracelet was confirming his line of thought. <em>“And…..another powerful additional effect!”</em></p>
 <p>The additional effect of this equipment was practically deviant in nature! The ability to control soulbeasts, that….that was….</p>
 <p><em>“It’s a little similar to how the Beast Taming School works….”</em> Bai Yunfei thought.<em> “But it shouldn’t be as cruel as how they do things. It only works when it’s worn right? And without the effect, the soulbeast goes back to normal. This….this is a miracle for soulbeasts!</em></p>
 <p><em>“But still. I wonder if this’ll be alright….it should be, right?”</em></p>
 <p>For some reason, a grim smile was on his face.<em> “In this case….ugh….</em></p>
 <p><em>“Was it because I used the +14 egg to craft this bracelet that the soul compatibility reached 60%?”</em></p>
 <p>The soul compatibility was abnormally high for what it should’ve been, so Bai Yunfei couldn’t help but guess at the reason why.</p>
 <p><em>“Never thought that I’d be able to get yet another soulbound armament! It’s a strong one too; coming into this cave was pretty damn worth it!”</em></p>
 <p>Obtaining this new soul armament was more than enough to clear away the feelings of sadness he felt from losing the +14 egg. Just looking at the bracelet was enough to make him pleased. “If this is a soulbound armament, I should give it a name. A bracelet or ring that can control soulbeasts….</p>
 <p><em>“I’ve got it! Since there’s a precedence, I’ll call it, the Beast Taming Ring!!”</em></p>
 <p>Done with naming the ring, Bai Yunfei decided to look outside the cave. “<em>Another day’s gone already, guess I’ll spend the night here again.”</em> he sighed.</p>
 <p>Plenty of concentration was used balancing the high grade materials together to craft the soul armament, so Bai Yunfei was more tired than usual. Stretching his back, he laid down next to Xiao Qi and slowly drifted to sleep.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Ssss….sssss….”</p>
 <p>In the darkness of the night, where the forest was outside the cave, a slithering sound made itself known somewhere in there. A pair of blue eyes stared adamantly at the cave a few hundred meters away, and a low grumble was heard from it….</p>
