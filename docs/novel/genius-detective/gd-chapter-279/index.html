 <p>Gu Xiaoting stared nervously at Chen Shi without talking.</p>
 <p>Others in the store noticed that the atmosphere wasn't quite right, so they stopped what they were doing to look at them.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi repeated the question and Gu Xiaoting remained silent. Lin Dongxue said, "Miss Gu, come back with us!" When she said this, she was ready to take out her handcuffs.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Gu Xiaoting flipped the table over suddenly and the sauces on the table all broke. Lin Dongxue screamed in horror, but at the critical moment, a strong arm blocked the table.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi blocked the table for her with one hand. He pushed away the table that was pressed on the two of them and said, "Chase after her!"</p>
 <p>The two chased outwards. Gu Xiaoting was speeding away on a motorcycle. When she was chased into an alley Gu Xiaoting's motorcycle rolled over because of the speed. She got up and drove away into the alley.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi rushed ahead, the the wind blowing noisily passed his ears due to his speed. He couldn’t see the road in front. Gu Xiaoting continued to rush ahead like a red shadow right through the middle of traffic. The harsh braking and sounds of collision were endless.</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi rushed onto the street, a car that braked suddenly knocked him to the ground. Chen Shi felt half of his body becoming numb, but worse than that, a car in the right lane that was full of cargo was still driving forward. The oncoming truck continued forward and desperately honked as he wouldn’t be able to brake in time.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi's miserable face was illuminated by snow-white lights. At this moment, he was pulled back by a hand. The moment he was pulled to the side, the truck drove past like the wind.</p>
 <p>What was most unbelievable was that it was Gu Xiaoting who rescued him. Chen Shi hesitated for only half a second, then grabbed Gu Xiaoting's arm. He felt as if he was taking revenge on his own savior, but he couldn’t help it.</p>
 <p>Just now, Lin Dongxue saw the complete scene and tears rolled from her eyes in fear. However, she did not forget her duty as a police officer and handcuffed Gu Xiaoting after crossing the road.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Thank you!" to Gu Xiaoting</p>
 <p>Gu Xiaoting glanced at him silently.</p>
 <p>There were several cars rear-ending each other on the road, but fortunately, no one was injured. For the time being, they were handed over to the traffic police. The two of them took Gu Xiaoting back to the office.</p>
 <p>Along the way, no matter how much Chen Shi talked, Lin Dongxue didn't open her mouth. She kept biting her lips and holding back the tears in her eyes. In order to prevent Chen Shi from seeing, her face kept looking out the window.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Gu Xiaoting was taken to the Public Security Bureau and was sent to the interrogation room. Lin Dongxue's dissatisfaction finally broke out. She punched Chen Shi's chest and cried, "Asshole, you don't know how scared I was just now. Why did you try so hard? You’re not a policeman, so even if you died, you wouldn’t be a martyr!”</p>
 <p>"I..." Chen Shi couldn’t find a word of comfort.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue punched him again. "My parents died in a car accident. I was young and didn’t see it with my own eyes, but do you know how much of a trauma it was for me? I always had nightmares of them dying until high school!"</p>
 <p>"Dongxue, I'm sorry."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue seemed to be out of control, crying and hugging Chen Shi. She was crying like a child without any concealment as her warm tears penetrated into Chen Shi's clothes.</p>
 <p>"Stop doing this stupid stuff! Stop doing this stupid stuff!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi knew that no matter what he said, he wouldn’t be able to comfort her. He knew that she cared too much about him, so he took Lin Dongxue's face using his big hands and kissed her on the lips. Lin Dongxue also held Chen Shi's face and from a shallow kiss, they changed to a deep kiss. The dark night was boundless and the cold wind was circling around but the two were warmed by a warm current from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
 <p>After the affectionate kiss of love ended, Lin Dongxue's cheeks blushed to her ears and her heart was pounding. She concealed this by pushing her hair around and later raised her head to look up at Chen Shi’s eyes. At this moment, silence was golden.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue grabbed Chen Shi's neck again and Chen Shi smiled before lowering his voice. "Let’s wait for the case to be finished."</p>
 <p>Ten minutes later, the two entered the interrogation room. Gu Xiaoting, who wasn’t used to handcuffs, was rubbing her wrists from side to side. Chen Shi handed her a bottle of warm coffee and said, "Thank you for saving me. I owe you one."</p>
 <p>"No... It’s nothing. I think you are a good person. You shouldn't be damned." Gu Xiaoting said with a lowered head.</p>
 <p>"Do you think Ma Jianjun is a bad person?" Chen Shi asked in a soothing tone.</p>
 <p>"..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sat down and picked up the document at hand. It was a printed report. He said, "Three years ago, you were disfigured by your stubborn boyfriend who splashed you with sulphuric acid. Then, you came to Long’an to work and slowly save money. You got skin grafts and started a new life. You accidentally learned about a man who wanted to kill a cat. You saw the shadow of your boyfriend in him, so you decided to help Miss Jiang?"</p>
 <p>"..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi added his speculation to the case. "That night, Miss Jiang ate at the Japanese restaurant and dropped the bag. It gave you a great opportunity. You found that her key was the same as your model so you switched them quietly. You went to deliver a meal that day to Ma Jianjun's house, so you knew what his house looked like. That’s when you planned a near-perfect murder. You entered the community at 10:50 while the reporters were interviewing other people, quietly entered the unit building, and waited. When Ma Jianjun spoke to reporters through the window, you went into his house and snuck into the room, waiting for Ma Jianjun to finish the conversation. He entered the bedroom and you killed him with a hammer from behind the door. Then, you sprayed water out the window to make the reporters panic. You quickly took a photo with Ma Jianjun's mobile phone and used the cat to set up a time-delayed mechanism to send out a Weibo post. Finally, you left the scene silently... Not only are you careful, but you also had good luck. Miss Jiang dropping her bag and you sneaking into the house weren’t part of the plan. It was noticed that the cat licked the nutrition cream on the mobile phone at 12:00, all of which required luck to complete.”</p>
 <p>"So you think..." Gu Xiaoting said slowly, "God borrowed my hand to make him die. If one step of my actions were unsuccessful, the whole plan would have been abandoned."</p>
 <p>"But we won't arrest God. You are the person who took action, so we will only arrest you."</p>
 <p>Gu Xiaoting lowered her head, "I don't regret it! I was hurt by a stubborn man and he ruined my life. That kind of man who thinks that so long as he loves another person, he can control and hurt them as they want simply didn't grow up. These bear boys<span id="footnote-ref-d259"><a href="#footnote-d259">[1]</a></span> can do anything. I hope that no other girl in the world will suffer this kind of torture... If I had not been arrested this time, I would continue to help other girls until I’m arrested one day... " She looked up. "You said I was lucky. I was not lucky. I met an opponent like you."</p>
 <p>"If you didn't save me just earlier, you probably wouldn’t be sitting here right now. Anyway, thank you."</p>
 <p>"I just..." Gu Xiaoting looked at Lin Dongxue. "I didn’t want to make this sister sad. I saw her comforting Miss Jiang that day. I think she's a very good person."</p>
 <p>"Thank you!" Lin Dongxue said sincerely. "I will remember this forever."</p>
