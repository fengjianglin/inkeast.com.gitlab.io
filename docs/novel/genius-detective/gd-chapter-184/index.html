 <p>Jia Xingyun said, “I'll send them away!” Then, he closed the bedroom door.</p>
 <p>After seeing the popular custard boy<span id="footnote-ref-95e2"><a href="#footnote-95e2">[1]</a></span> appearing on the bed of a rich second-generation in Long'an, Lin Dongxue was so speechless that she only asked after a while, “What is your relationship with each other?”</p>
 <p>“Any relationship of mine has nothing to do with you. Any words that characterize our relationship will tarnish our relationship, so I’ll need to ask Miss Lin not to make any associations or connections. I need you both to say nothing about this when you get out of this door. This is just my private life. It’s not something that harms the world.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi raised his hand. “I'm sorry to bother you guys. Can I borrow a bathroom?”</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun dismissed, “Don't play this game with me. Do you want my DNA? The toilet is very dirty. I'll just give it to you!”</p>
 <p>“It really surprises me that Mr. Jia is so cooperative.”</p>
 <p>“It’s because I’m innocent. But in exchange, I want you to tell me what you’re suspecting me of.”</p>
 <p>“Do you have any cotton swabs?”</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun fetched a cotton swab and Lin Dongxue took some samples from the upper wall of his mouth and put them in the evidence bag. Then, they fulfilled their promise and told him what they were suspecting him of.</p>
 <p>“So you suspect that I planned the kidnapping case five years ago?” Jia Xingyun laughed out loud. “I really admire your creativity!”</p>
 <p>“Doubting everything is part of our job.” Lin Dongxue said a little heatedly.</p>
 <p>“Good job! Good job!” Jia Xingyun applauded. “In fact, I know who the mastermind is. If Miss Lin is willing to accompany me for dinner, I can tell you.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue frowned. “Excuse me. Don't you like men?”</p>
 <p>“I like everything that’s beautiful.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi laughed at himself. “It seems I wasn’t born handsome enough.”</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun gave him a disgusted look, but looking back at Lin Dongxue, his eyes softened again. “Think about it.”</p>
 <p>“If you’re not the mastermind, but you know who it is, then this person is Lu Zhendong, right?” Chen Shi speculated.</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun's expression was flustered for a moment. “Respect! You broke through my bottom card<span id="footnote-ref-6d6d"><a href="#footnote-6d6d">[2]</a></span>.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your valuable clues. We won’t bother you any longer.”</p>
 <p>“If the events of today gets out as gossip, I’ll sue you!” Jia Xingyun reminded them once again.</p>
 <p>When they went downstairs, Lin Dongxue questioned, “Isn't Lu Zhendong dead? What’s the significance of Ji Chunma's evidence?”</p>
 <p>“You should think from the perspective of Ji Chunma. For five years, he has used this evidence to extort Lu Zhendong. While extorting him, he has his own risks to deal with too. Now that Lu Zhendong is dead, since the police still haven’t found out about this at all, he hurried back to Long’an to destroy the evidence. He probably thought that if he destroyed it, he could start from scratch. He wouldn’t have expected that during this crucial moment…”</p>
 <p>“I didn't expect everything to be exposed like this!”</p>
 <p>“The last case is not over yet, right?”</p>
 <p>“We’re still doing post-case admin.”</p>
 <p>“Then, we should look up Lu Zhendong's finances while we’re at it.”</p>
 <p>After getting back, the waiting policemen couldn't wait to ask what was found. Chen Shi said, “We made a mistake. He and his girlfriend were having a nice night together. We made a blunder.”</p>
 <p>Everyone sighed in disappointment as Chen Shi handed the DNA sample to Peng Sijue. “This is Jia Xingyun's DNA. By the way, you can compare the blood on the banknote with Lu Zhendong's DNA.”</p>
 <p>It was almost 8:00 PM when Chen Shi got home. Old Lady Liu had fallen asleep after eating and Dog Egg was still playing games. Tao Yueyue was sitting on the sofa in the living room holding a criminal psychology book she had taken from Chen Shi’s bookshelf.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue closed the book with a sigh like an adult and said, “It's so tiring being a sister. This child has too much energy.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi walked up to the table and opened the lid on the plate of leftovers. “Did he say anything?”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue shook her head. “He’s been playing all day long. I feel that he’s in a good mood but he’s just not talking.”</p>
 <p>“Want to go out?”</p>
 <p>“Okay!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s bring him with us!”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Tao Yueyue's tone lowered suddenly.</p>
 <p>After having a few bites, Chen Shi went to ask Dog Egg. “Dog Egg, do you want to go out for a walk with Uncle?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg shook his head and continued to play Crossfire<span id="footnote-ref-4636"><a href="#footnote-4636">[3]</a></span>. He was simulating the sound of gunshots with his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Then, I‘ll just go out to eat ice cream with Yueyue. Stay at home like a good boy then. Don’t wake up your grandma… Yueyue, what kind of ice cream do you want to eat?”</p>
 <p>“I heard that there’s a new variety that’s come out. It’s a large glass of ice cream sprinkled with a thick coat of chocolate sauce and crushed chocolate in the middle.”</p>
 <p>“Is it delicious? I want a cup too!”</p>
 <p>“It'll be wonderful to have a big cola after eating it as well.”</p>
 <p>The two continued like this and Dog Egg was immediately tempted. He even stopped playing the game and looked at them shyly.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi patted him on the head and said, “Be good at home. We'll be back in a bit.”</p>
 <p>When they got dressed, Dog Egg ran out and silently held Tao Yueyue's clothes. Chen Shi asked, “You don't want us to go?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Do you want to go to the bathroom?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg shook his head.</p>
 <p>“How would I know what you want if you don’t talk?”</p>
 <p>“I-ice cream.” Dog Egg stuttered.</p>
 <p>“Put on your clothes and we can go!”</p>
 <p>They went to a nearby fast food restaurant and the chocolate sundae made Dog Egg’s eyes turn into crescent-shaped moons. Tao Yueyue said, “So pure. He was bribed just like that.”</p>
 <p>“Fifty steps laughing at a hundred steps<span id="footnote-ref-f7ea"><a href="#footnote-f7ea">[4]</a></span>. Let’s get to business!” Chen Shi said. “Can you tell your uncle what you saw that night in the house?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Dog Egg looked terrified. He stared at Chen Shi with widened eyes and his mouth covered in chocolate sauce.</p>
 <p>“Still can’t? Do we really need to find a psychologist?”</p>
 <p>“I'll try and talk to him. Uncle Chen, go outside for a while.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went outside and watched the two children from the other side of the glass. At the beginning, Tao Yueyue was the only one talking. Slowly, Dog Egg began to talk more and more.</p>
 <p>After waiting for half an hour, Tao Yueyue indicated with her finger for him to come back in, so Chen Shi put out his cigarette butt and went back in. Tao Yueyue whispered, “He told me. I recorded it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was very happy and said to Dog Egg, “Shall we go home?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg shook his head, pointing to the children's center in the fast food restaurant. Chen Shi said, “Then, you go and play there for a while!”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg tugged at Tao Yueyue's sleeve and said, “Sister, play with me!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue lied to him. “Elder sister is too big. Only small children are allowed to go in there. We’ll watch you from here, okay?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg believed that it was true and ran in to play by himself.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue took out her mobile phone and played the recording. Dog Egg’s words were intermittent with some of Tao Yueyue’s words mixed in.</p>
 <p>The contents of the recording was vaguely that Dog Egg broke a small toy that day. He remembered that it was white. Wang Xifeng yelled non-stop at him. When his grandma showed up, the pieces on the ground turned black and Wang Xifeng said it was an antique worth a lot of money.</p>
 <p>Because the bad woman was lying, he was beaten by his grandma. Dog Egg was so angry that he broke a bunch of small cups on the table and ran away.</p>
 <p>At night, he and his grandma could only spend the night in a small, cold, and bright house. Dog Egg thought that all of this was caused by the bad woman. The place they were at was very close to the bad woman's house, so he snuck into the community when his grandma fell asleep.</p>
 <p>From his memory, he found the bad woman's house. He wanted to get revenge on her, but he didn't expect that the door was not closed. He pushed the door open a little and smelled a heavy smell in the room. The bad woman lay on the ground with widened eyes...</p>
