 <p>Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue went to the first floor miserably and Lin Dongxue complained, “He’s just a servant, but he had such a big attitude... What now?”</p>
 <p>“Call your brother! Bring more people over.”</p>
 <p>“What? Are you going to make it clear now?”</p>
 <p>“I think X may be here. After you call, go to Old Man Lu's room and keep watch. Don't let anyone except Dr. Xu in. I’ll be outside and won’t let anyone out.”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it a bit too risky?”</p>
 <p>“Old Man Lu has invited so many doctors over. It seems that the operation is imminent. X will not allow the operation to proceed. The long night will have many dreams<span id="footnote-ref-8a1b"><a href="#footnote-8a1b">[1]</a></span>. It’s best to resolve this now... Although he is a nasty old man, I don't want him to die.”</p>
 <p>“Your last sentence seems a bit redundant!” Lin Dongxue smiled and took out the phone.</p>
 <p>Immediately after the call was made, all the lights there suddenly turned black. The slick-back screamed in fear, “Oh no, the old man’s equipment!”</p>
 <p>There was the sound of footsteps in the dark and Chen Shi once again reminded, “Someone wants to kill him. Hurry upstairs! No one except Dr. Xu is allowed to go in!”</p>
 <p>“How about you?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll think of a way to solve this.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue quickly went upstairs and a bunch of people were running towards Old Man Lu's ward. Lin Dongxue shouted, “No one is allowed in!”</p>
 <p>The slick-back fiercely asked, “Who are you? Is it your turn to speak here?!”</p>
 <p>The malevolent-spirited woman recognized Lin Dongxue and said, “I saw her during the day. The old man didn't welcome her. How did she get in by herself?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue reluctantly showed her credentials. “Is this reason enough? Dr. Xu, hurry in and help him. As for the rest of you, you can’t leave this place.”</p>
 <p>The slick-back furrowed his brows. “I'll go and take a look at the electric box!”</p>
 <p>The malevolent-spirited woman said, “I'll go too!”</p>
 <p>The two went away and there was a hard gasp from Old Man Lu from in the door. Dr. Xu ran out and said, “The dialysis machine and the ventilator have stopped. If this goes on, Old Man Lu may not be able to hang on for more than five minutes...”</p>
 <p>“Hurry to the hospital!” A servant said.</p>
 <p>“There’s no time!” Dr. Xu cried.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue gritted her teeth. It was too late to go to any hospital from the villa's location. She could only put her trust in Chen Shi. “Doing your best is fine. My companion is trying to find a solution right now!”</p>
 <p>“If he dies, it's not my responsibility!”</p>
 <p>“I will testify for you.”</p>
 <p>Downstairs, a group of people were rushing to check the electric box. The electric box had water poured on it and had short-circuited. Chen Shi pushed them away, checked it, and commanded, “Go and get gloves as well as electrician tools!”</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Someone asked.</p>
 <p>“Is this the time for that? Hurry up! I know how to fix it!”</p>
 <p>Someone ran to get the tools. Chen Shi put on rubber gloves, took the electrician's tools, broke the wires on both sides, reconnected it around the electrical box, and entangled them tightly with tape. One doctor said, “No, the voltage is too high like this. The equipment will get fried.”</p>
 <p>“Then turn on the appliances in the whole house and share the voltage... Hurry up!”</p>
 <p>Everyone ran around and turned on all the lights and electrical appliances that could be turned on. Chen Shi was able to restore the power in a timely manner. The medical equipment in the ward was back up and running. Old Man Lu took a long breath and opened his eyes again.</p>
 <p>Dr. Xu said cheerfully, “This is great. This is really great! I almost couldn’t keep you.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue also wiped her head full of sweat, thinking that it was very fortunate. Old Man Lu had to move the instrument to his home. Wouldn't it be more convenient for people to hurt him?</p>
 <p>She suddenly noticed that a servant was walking away quietly and yelled at them to halt them. “Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>The servant was the man who had a bad tone just then. He said, “I’m getting a wet towel for the old man.”</p>
 <p>“Don't move. Nobody can move!”</p>
 <p>“What are we going to do if we don’t move? What right do you have to direct us?”</p>
 <p>A group of servants followed the quarrel. “If something else happens to him, will you be responsible for it?”, “The person who broke the power supply hasn’t been caught yet!”, “The police only know how to threaten us. Why don't you do something serious?”</p>
 <p>“Be quiet. We’re dealing with this step by step. Do as you’re told and don’t create chaos!” Lin Dongxue shouted. The quarrelling dimmed down after that.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi finally came and said, “Everyone go downstairs. The police will solve this in a moment.”</p>
 <p>As soon as they heard that the police were coming, the servants walked down the stairs obediently. Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue finally came down. They stood at the entrance of the stairs. This was the only way to the second floor. The living room was already full of people. The people didn't understand the situation at all.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi whispered to Lin Dongxue, “Give me handcuffs.”</p>
 <p>After receiving the handcuffs, Chen Shi signaled that Lin Dongxue could make her identity public. Lin Dongxue took out her badge and said to everyone, “We are police officers and are investigating a case. We suspect that the suspect is in this room.”</p>
 <p>The slick-back said indignantly, “This is just ridiculous. You can investigate, but how can you disturb the old man? You can see what the situation is like right now.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, “This case is closely related to the safety and security of Old Man Lu.”</p>
 <p>He walked in front of a group of people and asked the slick-back, “What's your name?”</p>
 <p>“Shi Zilu...” The slick-back reluctantly said. “I am the current vice president of the old man’s company and I’ve almost completely taken over.”</p>
 <p>“Why do you call him your father?”</p>
 <p>“You heard?” Shi Zilu looked embarrassed and looked around. “That's just our private name. I recognize him as a godfather. Of course, we are not related by blood.”</p>
 <p>“Recently, did the old man give you a task for you to give another person a paternity test?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no such thing!” Shi Zilu simply refused.</p>
 <p>“Didn't he?” Chen Shi looked around the faces of these people with different expressions. “Actually, everyone around the old man knows about this. He has an illegitimate but biological child. Because he suddenly suffered from kidney disease, he needs a kidney transplant. Since the two legitimate sons are no longer present, he called this biological flesh back. Old Man Lu did not want any incidents before the operation, so the identity of the biological son was not disclosed. But for some people, the sudden appearance of the son undoubtedly touched their interests... “</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stopped in front of the malevolent-spirited woman and asked with a smile, “What's your surname?”</p>
 <p>“Shi.”</p>
 <p>“Miss Shi, I already know your relationship with Old Man Lu. You are the person who is most likely to get Old Man Lu’s inheritance, so you must not want this biological flesh to mess with it...”</p>
 <p>“What kind of nonsense are you spouting?” The malevolent-spirited woman yelled.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I met Old Man Lu six months ago. Back then, he was in good health. Why did he get so sick in such a short time?”</p>
 <p>“He's old. Isn't it normal to be old, get sick, and die from it?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi gestured for her not to interrupt and continued. “I have seen him. I suspect he has been poisoned. He’s been poisoned quite a number of times with trace amounts of poisoning. It is not clear to me whether the poisoner is you or not. Actually, that’s not important... What’s important is the poisoner did not let go of his biological flesh either... “</p>
 <p>Chen Shi turned around suddenly, knocking the pale-faced servant to the ground with a punch, and quickly handcuffed him. The room was suddenly shocked. Chen Shi lifted the sleeve of his left arm and glanced at it. When he saw that the veins were bulging, he let down his worries. He hadn’t been mistaken.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pressed down the head of the servant and said, “You are Wang Haitao... Or I should call you the fake Wang Haitao!”</p>
