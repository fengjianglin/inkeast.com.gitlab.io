 <p>Chen Shi didn't go flag down customers today, but was instead driving around in the city.</p>
 <p>He had three photos in his hand. It was what the mysterious boy had given him in an envelope. The first was of Tao Yueyue, the second was of Lin Dongxue, and the third was of himself.</p>
 <p>All three photos had red crosses over them and they were all photos taken secretly. The intention of the other party was obvious. This was a silent threat.</p>
 <p>Recently, he had solved many cases. It was not ruled out that a suspect's relatives or friends did it, but he always had a lingering face in his heart - Zhou Xiao!</p>
 <p>He had considered it for a whole night yesterday. Should he no longer assist in solving cases from now on? Move away from Long'an? No, evasion won’t solve the problem. But if he didn’t evade, someone would die. The hints in the photos were blatantly clear. Either Tao Yueyue or Lin Dongxue would die.</p>
 <p>He picked up the photos and looked for where the shot was taken. Tao Yueyue usually had a simple life. It was easy to determine the angle of the sneak shot, which was an alleyway on her way to school.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t tell with Lin Dongxue’s photo.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t figure out his own either. The person in the photo seemed a bit strange to him, but then again, it wasn’t his own face to begin with.</p>
 <p>After driving around for almost a day, Chen Shi returned home in the afternoon. He was exhausted and just wanted to go home for a drink.</p>
 <p>When he got downstairs, a truck was unloading furniture. Chen Shi didn't think much about it. He went straight upstairs. The door opposite them was open. A beautiful lady with glasses was standing there. Chen Shi looked behind her. The room was empty.</p>
 <p>“New here?” Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>“Hello, my name is Gu You. We’ll be neighbors from now on.” The beauty stretched out her hand and Chen Shi shook hands with her.</p>
 <p>The workers moved the sofa up the stairs. The corridor was very narrow. Gu You flashed to Chen Shi's side. The jasmine perfume on her body drifted into Chen Shi's nose. Chen Shi glanced at her. Her figure was unbelievably good.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, can I go to your house for a while? I’m estimating that the move won’t be finished for quite a while,” Gu You laughed.</p>
 <p>“Don't you need to watch over them in person? Just in case your furniture scratches against each other.”</p>
 <p>“It doesn't matter. It's not worth much anyway.”</p>
 <p>“Then... Feel free to come in!”</p>
 <p>Entering Chen Shi's house, Gu You looked around. “Wow, the house is pretty good. It’s bigger than mine.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi poured her a glass of water. “Did you buy the house?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I bought it. I heard that it will be demolished. Is that true?”</p>
 <p>“It will take quite a few years though.”</p>
 <p>“You live alone?”</p>
 <p>“No...” Chen Shi hesitated, not knowing what to say. “I have a daughter.”</p>
 <p>“Single dad?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took a bottle of Red Label from the refrigerator and poured himself a cup. Gu You said, “Sorry, can I have a drink as well?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought this woman was a little rude, but she was a guest after all. He said, “I'll get you a cup.”</p>
 <p>Gu You took a sip from the rock glass and looked at the cup in her hand. “I like the taste of whiskey. It’s very smooth.”</p>
 <p>“This is just cheap stuff. If you like it, you can buy a bottle for yourself.”</p>
 <p>“What's your job?”</p>
 <p>“A driver.”</p>
 <p>“I'm a psychiatrist and I run a psychological clinic here. Here's my business card.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took the business card and glanced at it. Gu You's temperament was indeed very understanding. Chen Shi noticed the wear on the edges of her nails and the calluses on the inside of her wrist. She should be a person who has been working with computers for a long time.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, “No wonder you always stare at my nose when you talk to me.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, the rule of social psychology. When looking at the triangle between the eyes and nose, it’s the most polite… How do I address you?”</p>
 <p>“Chen Shi.”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Chen has also studied psychology?”</p>
 <p>“Just interested in it.”</p>
 <p>“I think we have a lot of common topics with each other. At least you don't ask the question, ‘Do you know what I'm thinking?’”</p>
 <p>“Psychology studies the laws and principles of psychological activity, not its content.”</p>
 <p>“Out of curiosity, do you think there’s real mind reading?”</p>
 <p>“What do you think?”</p>
 <p>Gu You looked around, “Mr. Chen should have suffered major trauma. On the surface, you’re calm and open-minded, but you lack a sense of security internally. You’ve been under stress for a long time and you have the urge to escape reality.”</p>
 <p>“How did you get to that conclusion?”</p>
 <p>“As soon as you come into this house, it feels warm and comfortable. The living room is to show your supposed personality towards outsiders. The bedroom symbolizes your internal personality. Mr. Chen's bedroom is very messy, indicating that you deliberately present the good side to outsiders. In addition, I noticed that there were no sharp things on the coffee table, such as scissors, fruit knives, toothpicks, and the like, which means that you lack security in your heart. You do your best to eliminate the hidden dangers.“</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stood up, closed the bedroom door, and laughed. “I don’t live in that bedroom... But what you said is a bit reasonable. It’s worth studying psychology.”</p>
 <p>Gu You prepared to pour another glass of wine, but Chen Shi took the bottle away. “I still have something to do, sorry!”</p>
 <p>“It's okay, it was a pleasure chatting with you.”</p>
 <p>After sending Gu You away, Chen Shi sniffed. There was still the smell of perfume in the room. He quickly turned on the air conditioner to ventilate and he washed the cups used by Gu You. He even wiped the fingerprints from the table.</p>
 <p>He suddenly laughed. Why was he so cautious about this? Was he afraid that Lin Dongxue would not be happy when she came back and smelled the perfume?</p>
 <p>Today, Lin Dongxue was moving away!</p>
 <p>Although he liked Lin Dongxue, he didn't want to involve her in his danger. Was his approach correct? He was very conflicted.</p>
 <p>At 5:00, Lin Dongxue returned, and Chen Shi said, “I'm not trying to drive you away. I just don't think it's appropriate to live together.”</p>
 <p>“I know, I know... I'm going to pack up.”</p>
 <p>“Did you find a house?”</p>
 <p>“I did. I have paid the deposit as well.”</p>
 <p>“Then, I'll call the moving company.”</p>
 <p>It could be seen that Lin Dongxue was not in a good mood today. Chen Shi sighed in his heart. <em>Sorry!</em></p>
 <p>While waiting for the moving company's car to come, Chen Shi ordered Lin Dongxue's favorite takeaway. The two were sitting in the living room with Lin Dongxue's packages placed at the door. Lin Dongxue said, “Oh yes, I need to tell you about this.”</p>
 <p>She told Chen Shi about the case file she saw in the morning and the serial killer's crimes again.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi's response was unexpected. He grabbed Lin Dongxue's shoulder and said, “You’re sure it’s the same branding?!”</p>
 <p>“Uh... Captain Peng asked me to ask your opinion.”</p>
 <p>How was he asking for his opinion? Peng Sijue clearly told Chen Shi about this using Lin Dongxue.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi muttered for a moment and shook his head, “I can’t intake too much just hearing you talk about it. Show me the file next time.”</p>
 <p>There was the sound of a car from outside and Lin Dongxue went to the window. She smiled bitterly. “The moving company has arrived early. It seems that we won’t have time to eat the take-outs... Then, thank you for taking care of me during this time.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi didn't speak and looked down.</p>
 <p>“Old Chen?”</p>
 <p>“Wait, you don't have to go. You should just live here from now on!”</p>
