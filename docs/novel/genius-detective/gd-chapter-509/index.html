 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ding Ding Ding Ding...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the first bell for the new semester in September. As soon as the teacher left, Wei Zengmali ran over to Tao Yueyue's seat and said happily, "Yueyue, you’re too amazing! You took the first seat in our grade for our final exams! Treat me to some food!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue was packing up her notes and took out a textbook. "It's nothing much. I’m only the first in our grade.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Only the first in our grade?!" Wei Zengmali repeated this sentence with exaggerated expressions. "You’re too calm. You only transferred here a semester ago and you took first place in our grade. There’s so many people who are jealous. Look at Li Yantong.” She glanced over at the few girls who were gossiping together. The class representative, Li Yantong who was smiling suddenly retracted it and looked at them with cold eyes before going back to gossiping again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Zengmali lowered her voice and said to Tao Yueyue, "Did you notice that the way Li Yantong looks at you doesn’t seem normal? It must be jealousy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Follow me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue stood up and Wei Zengmali followed behind, puzzled. She actually went straight towards Li Yantong. The other party stopped talking and showed a hostile look. Several of her buddies also looked at Tao Yueyue. Their eyes looked like wolves who saw an intruder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Explain!" Tao Yueyue looked at Li Yantong's face and said coldly. She was ten centimeters shorter than Li Yantong. It looked like a lower-grade student was talking to a senior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Explain what?" Li Yantong smiled and put her finger on her chin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue opened the new book she had just received. There were many pages with shoe prints on it, causing it to be tattered. She said, "Why was the new book I received like this? You’re the class representative. I request a replacement.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What right do you have?" Li Yantong said arrogantly. "You want to exchange it after accidentally damaging it? If you pay another textbook fee, I can tell the teacher."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I accidentally did it myself?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong looked at her with her head tilted and her friends were sneering on the side. "Do you suspect that I did it? Do you have evidence?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Of course!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This sentence surprised Li Yantong, and she frowned, "Let me have a look."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue held up her phone, which contained a photo of shoe prints. "This is a photo I took of your shoe prints today. It’s exactly the same as in my book. These shoes are worn on your feet right now. You’re still denying it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong's eyes widened and she continued denying, "Then tell the teacher. Would I be afraid of you? You just scored first place in our grade’s exam. Who do you think you are? I’m the class representative of this class!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So, you admit it?" Tao Yueyue stared straight into her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong's cheeks flushed. Fortunately, the class bell rang, and Tao Yueyue left her with a threatening look. After she returned to her seat, a friend sent a text message to Li Yantong, "Elder Sister Tong, you’re not being careful. What if she told the teacher? What would we do?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong replied disdainfully, "She’s so introverted. I don't think she’ll find a teacher. Tch, I’m letting her know that I don't like her, so what?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this time, Tao Yueyue also received a text message from Wei Zengmali. "Li Yantong is so ridiculous. As class representative, how can she do such a thing? Should we report to the teacher?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue replied, "No!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Zengmali persuaded her, "She’s very powerful in the class. You can’t just bear it and swallow it back. Otherwise, you’ll be bullied every day like xx.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The teacher came in and everyone stood up to greet them. After sitting down, Tao Yueyue calmly opened her textbook as if nothing had happened. In fact, in her heart, she was already scheming a plan of revenge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a perfect time to experiment with the skills she learned during this time! A sneer of anticipation formed on the corners of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After school in the evening, Li Yantong walked out of the school campus with her friends. When she got to the bus station, she said goodbye to her friends and got on one of the buses. Sitting down, she had a habit of going through her circle of friends<span id="footnote-ref-a67a"><a href="#footnote-a67a">[1]</a></span> on her phone. However, when she reached into her bag, she realized something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her phone was stolen!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Moreover, the "thieving" skills were superb. They stole the phone but put the phone case back into her pocket. In order to prevent her from detecting the change in weight, the case was filled with paper cut into the size of the phone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong took out the paper in shock and saw the bottom one read: "The phone is in the classroom. Come and get it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Asshole!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her first reaction was to think of who it was that pranked her. She got off at the next stop and hurried back to school.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this time, there were no more people on campus, and the students also finished their cleaning duties and went home. However, the door of the classroom was open. She returned to her seat and found the phone in her desk drawer, but it had no battery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The door slammed shut and Li Yantong rushed to the door, shouting, "Who is it? Open the door! You can’t play jokes like this on people!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dong. Dong. Dong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Someone was knocking on the window. She walked over to the window and looked out. Tao Yueyue stood there with a sneer on her face. Li Yantong's face was twisted in anger. “Tao Yueyue, so it really was you! You xxxx!” She said a lot of unpleasant words in a single breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue looked as though it didn’t affect her at all. "Save some energy. The teachers are all gone. It’s useless for you to call out... Tomorrow, if the teacher asks, you can say you came back to get your phone and the wind blew the door shut."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ll tell the class teacher!!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really? Go ahead, but if you dare to say a single word, I’ll send out the "interesting things" in your phone to everyone. If everyone knew that your mother is a mistress, I wonder how they’d react?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You..." Li Yantong couldn't believe that she was so vicious. She was just joking with her, but she used this method to take revenge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue picked up a bottle of mineral water, "Apologize to me and I’ll give you this bottle of water."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You wish!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you sure?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong's lips twitched, but she finally made up her mind. "Don't even think about it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Goodbye then!" Tao Yueyue waved and left. She didn't leave from the main entrance because there was a security camera there. She left the school through an obscure corner after climbing over the wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Yantong shouted for a while in the classroom. The sky gradually darkened and she began crying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next day, the fact that Li Yantong was locked in the classroom became big news in the class. When the students asked, she said that when she came back to pick up her mobile phone, the wind blew the door shut.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It's just that the way she looked at Tao Yueyue had an added hint of fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Zengmali excitedly said to Tao Yueyue, "Haha, this is retribution. Who told her to always bully others?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yeah, if you keep doing bad things, you’re bound to meet your own end<span id="footnote-ref-43ca"><a href="#footnote-43ca">[2]</a></span>."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue smiled slightly. At this time, the class bell rang, and everyone returned to their seats. A new teacher was said to be coming in to teach their physics class today. Many of them were full of expectations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue didn't care about it at all. She lowered her head to do some after-class exercises. The teacher came in. He was an uncle with a smiling face. He bowed to everyone. "Hello everyone, I, Zhou Tiannan transferred to your school this year to teach physics. You guys can call me Teacher Zhou."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hello, Teacher Zhou!" The people below greeted in unison.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing the name, Tao Yueyue's hand trembled and the tip of the pencil broke. She looked up and Zhou Tiannan looked at her with a slight smile.</span></p>
