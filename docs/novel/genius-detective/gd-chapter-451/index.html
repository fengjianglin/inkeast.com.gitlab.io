 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue sat down in the car and looked down at her mobile phone. She breathed a sigh of relief. "It’s resolved on my brother’s side. A hostage was shot, but they’re not in danger."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That's good." Chen Shi kept staring ahead. At this time, they were following the paparazzi's car and had already started driving.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi was very careful and the other party never found out. The red car entered a neighborhood one hour later and the two also entered after them. They tailed them until the other party went to a building.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Chen Shi looked at the elevator and saw that it stopped on the 15</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;floor. Lin Dongxue asked, "Do you want to go up?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi thought. "According to their habits, they will shoot the incident location from the opposite building ... The opposite building will soon have an incident occur. Hurry up and go over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>The two reached the 15</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;floor of the opposite building quickly. Chen Shi put his ear on the door of the three units on the east side to eavesdrop on the movement inside. Then, he took out the detector and swept it around the area. They found a slight wireless signal on one of the doors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi whispered, "The eavesdropping device should be installed inside the house. Let’s break in!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"This... This isn’t in compliance with the standard procedures!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It’s an emergency. Did you bring your gun and handcuffs?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I did."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi took out the lockpicking tools and unlocked it swiftly before pushing the door in. There was no one in the living room. When the two went to the bedroom, they saw a thin, shirtless guy playing with a radio. He looked up and saw the figures from the window’s reflection. He was so scared that he almost jumped up. “Who are you guys?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue showed her badge. "Police. We suspect that you illegally possess a gun!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Gun?" The guy was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi took the detector and scanned over the radio. The signal was very strong. The guy said, "This is my hobby. It doesn’t break the law, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi glanced at the window and said, "We made a mistake. There’s no way to photograph the window of this house. It should be another unit."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You guys should have figured it out before rushing in. You almost gave me a heart attack." The guy complained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Sorry, we’re in the middle of an emergency... By the way, do you have any couples who quarrel a lot, problematic single-parent families, etc. living on your floor? Basically anyone that’s facing big problems."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I don't know what you're talking about!" The guy replied in a daze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue explained, "We are investigating illegal possessions of guns."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I don’t know what guns you’re talking about, but the room opposite of me is a little weird. It seems that there is a man and a woman, or maybe a man and two women because I often hear those kinds of noises in the middle of the night... You know the kind. However, I’ve never seen a woman go out. The man doesn’t seem to have any serious work either."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi shook his head and motioned for Lin Dongxue to head out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two went to the door on the opposite side and Chen Shi was about to pry the lock open again. Lin Dongxue said, "Let this not be a mistake this time. We just apologized for so long."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Surely not!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi opened the door and a woman in underwear ran out. "Dear, you’re back..." When she saw a stranger coming in, she ran to the bedroom in a panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi shouted, "Stop her!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue rushed over quickly and walked into the bedroom. She saw a gun and bullets on the dressing table and the woman was about to get the gun. Lin Dongxue quickly knocked her down. Chen Shi rushed in and took the gun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What are you doing! Are you robbers? I’ll shout!" The woman shouted and struggled under Lin Dongxue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Be more honest!" Lin Dongxue handcuffed her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Handcuff her to the pipes. Don't let her run away."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue did as she was told and the woman who felt like she was cuffed to the pipes for no reason screamed hysterically. Chen Shi glanced out at the window. In the corridor window opposite them, two figures rushed away quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi beckoned Lin Dongxue and the two sped downstairs, blocking the two paparazzi who were about to get in their car.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi raised the Makarov pistol in his hand. "Why don’t you have a look and see what this is?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The paparazzi pretended to be surprised and said, "Wow, a pistol!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Don’t play dumb. We only found this place by tailing you. How did you know that the person in the opposite unit had a gun? And it was before the police found out too. Explain it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">One of the paparazzi nervously glanced at the other, and the other paparazzi smiled. "Someone provided us with clues."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh really?" Chen Shi sneered. "Then this person should live here, right? Call him and tell him to come out. We will confront them face to face."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"This... This... We have to protect the identity of the person providing the clue, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Don’t play this trick with me. Would the police not protect their identity?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You should talk to our boss."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi pointed at the two of them. "I suspect you have a list of gun owners. You’re hiding instead of reporting it in order to capture news materials. This already constitutes breaking the law!" He raised his gun and the two were trembling with fright. Chen Shi shouted, "Lie on top of the car and don’t move! Wait for the police to come!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two looked at each other awkwardly, put down the equipment in their hands, and obediently lay on the car. Lin Dongxue stepped up and searched for their mobile phones. When she took out the stuff in their pockets, she found various fake documents. They were truly professionals in their industry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue called Lin Qiupu and a police car came not too long after. They took the two back for interrogation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The woman with the gun was also taken away. Her situation was a bit shocking. She was a missing person that was reported missing by her family for over three years. The man living with her was a pervert and imprisoned her illegally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">However, day after day, the woman actually became dependent and admired the man. However, this man recently brought in another woman. This woman became jealous. At this time, a pistol descended from the sky and increased her hatred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Today, she had intended to use the gun to kill the other woman when the man and the woman came back. Fortunately, Chen Shi found her in time, otherwise it would have been another tragedy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">These truths were only known after a few hours of interrogation. The police immediately arrested the pervert, but the two imprisoned women cried and shouted saying they didn’t want to be rescued. They were even willing to testify for the pervert in court. People could not help but think that Stockholm syndrome was truly terrifying!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two paparazzi were brought back to the bureau for interrogation in separate rooms. No matter what was asked, they’d only reply with a single sentence: "You should talk to my boss!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qiupu asked, "Do you think you’re just working to make money? Do you realize this is a violation of the law?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The paparazzi said disdainfully, "We haven't just violated the law once or twice. Freelance journalists are already a gray profession. People need to eat, officers. Honestly, how can we compete with the big media in obtaining news?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"But, this time you are breaking the law. You’ll need to go to jail!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why do we need to go to jail? We just took some news material without interfering with the parties, just like the cameramen who film seals in the North Pole. Even if the seals are killed, they wouldn’t be able to intervene. This is the professional conduct of journalists!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qiupu smacked on the table angrily. "Because you’re sheltering the criminals! Three people have died and a policeman was killed in the line of duty. Do you naively think that the court won’t hold you accountable? You guys should anticipate eating the prison meals!"</span></p>
