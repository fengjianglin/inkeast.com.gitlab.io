 <p>At about nine o'clock, most of the officers had already left and the criminal police department was deserted. Xu Xiaodong looked at the documents faxed over from the public security offices around the whole of China and said, "How nice. We’re the only ones left here. If we have any police reports come through today, it’ll definitely find its way to us.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Don’t worry about those. We should only check our own."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi bought some food and beverages before coming back. "How’s it going?"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong read the faxed file in his hand. "In the file sent by xx police, a girl disappeared in xx in 2005. There was a call record between the missing girl and Luo Zuyu. But the investigation was suspended due to insufficient evidence."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue read, "In 2007, a girl’s corpse was burned in the suburbs of xx City. The police found that she had booked a hotel room with Luo Zuyu before her death, but the hotel's surveillance footage was wiped out by someone, and the case fizzled out after that."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong read another one. "In 2010 in xx, a girl’s corpse was thrown into the sewers. Similarly, Luo Zuyu was an important suspect at the time, but at the critical moment, he produced an alibi and was released."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi reasoned, "One time might be a coincidence, but a few times indicate premeditated murder."</p>
 <p>"Is there a pattern to his murders?" Lin Dongxue asked.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi shook his head. "This should be discussed later. I need you to investigate the identity of the deceased."</p>
 <p>"This... How do we investigate this?"</p>
 <p>"The deceased should be a fan. Since Luo Zuyu can contact her, it means that she’s not just an ordinary fan. She should have participated in fan activities like welcoming him at the airport or train station and so on. You can go to the local fan support group to try to find out... Remember her characteristics are that she’s 24 years-old, 167 in height, with size 34 shoes. As for her looks…"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi grabbed the faxed documents in their hands. There were several photos of the missing and deceased girls on them. Chen Shi laid out all these photos on the table. "Luo Zuyu likes this type. Follow this feeling to investigate!"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong mumbled, "Upon a closer look, these girls all have very large eyes and slightly protruding foreheads."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Close the door when you leave. I don't want to be disturbed."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong saluted, "Yes, sir!"</p>
 <p>After the two left, Chen Shi turned on the computer and searched for "Luo Zuyu" and "interview". He put on headphones and began to go through his interview records.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue found the Luo Zuyu Fan Support Group in Long'an City by phone. The group leader said that there was indeed a person named Ling Shuangshuang who matched those characteristics. The group leader remembered that she had handed over the flowers to Luo Zuyu on the day that they welcomed him at the airport.</p>
 <p>After that, Lin Dongxue and Xu Xiaodong went to Ling Shuangshuang's residence. They knocked on the door and no one answered. They found a locksmith to open the lock. The moment the door opened, the locksmith exclaimed, "Aiya, my mother!". There was a pool of blood on the living room floor.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue gave Xu Xiaodong a glance and entered the house holding her gun with him. They found a female body in the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong was startled and said, "I’ll call for back-up."</p>
 <p>"There’s nobody else in the team!"</p>
 <p>"Then... Do we both have to check the body ourselves then?”</p>
 <p>"Did you bring gloves?"</p>
 <p>"No."</p>
 <p>"Go to the kitchen to see if you can find rubber gloves."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong found two pairs of plastic gloves. Lin Dongxue began to examine the female body after putting them on. The female body was damp. The corpse seemed to have been washed with water and her face was corroded beyond recognition by something acidic.</p>
 <p>Of course, Lin Dongxue wasn’t well-versed in forensic pathology. She compared the female corpse's feet with her hand and said, "Her feet are bigger than mine. Definitely bigger than size 34... Looking at the skin, she doesn’t seem to match the age bracket either. Is this Ling Shuangshuang's home?"</p>
 <p>"I just saw Luo Zuyu's photos and newspaper clippings all over the wall. The owner of the property is a typical groupie.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue picked up the female corpse's hand and found that her palm was rough and covered with old calluses. She suddenly had a frightening thought. "This... This wouldn’t be the missing female cleaner, right?!"</p>
 <p>"Why did they leave the corpse here?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue shook her head. "I'll take some photos first."</p>
 <p>Without a camera, she could only use a mobile phone. She carefully photographed every detail. Xu Xiaodong inspected the house. There was only a pool of blood in the living room, but the bedroom had been ransacked, as if something had been taken away.</p>
 <p>The locksmith was still standing at the door and asked weakly, "Officers, can I go now?"</p>
 <p>"Oh, you can go. By the way, don’t speak carelessly about this matter outside."</p>
 <p>When the locksmith left, a girl happened to come upstairs. She glanced at Xu Xiaodong a few times, walked up to the floor above, came back and then went back down the stairs. Xu Xiaodong found it a bit suspicious and stopped her. "Who are you looking for?"</p>
 <p>"I... I went to the wrong place."</p>
 <p>"Don't be afraid. We’re the police." Xu Xiaodong showed her his credentials.</p>
 <p>"You really are the police!" The girl said in surprise. "Did something happen to Shuangshuang?"</p>
 <p>"You are…"</p>
 <p>"I'm her friend. I haven't been able to contact her for a few days. I was a little worried, so I came to have a look... I just saw you standing at the door and thought that you were a bad person. That’s why I didn’t dare to come over.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue came out and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>
 <p>The girl said, "Elder Sister, are you also a police officer?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Lin Dongxue blocked her view and prevented her from seeing the blood stains on the floor of the living room. "We want to find out some things from you. Let's go to another place to talk!"</p>
 <p>"Okay... Okay."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue told Xu Xiaodong to go down with her first and locked the door herself. She left the scene to Chen Shi. After all, she couldn’t handle it herself.</p>
 <p>The three found a pavilion in the neighborhood to sit down in. The girl asked, "What exactly happened to Shuangshuang?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked, "When was the last time you were able to contact her?"</p>
 <p>"Can't you tell me first? I care about her very much!"</p>
 <p>"You need to tell me first. I'll tell you after you finish, okay?"</p>
 <p>The girl accepted this condition and showed them her mobile phone. Ling Shuangshuang's last WeChat message was sent at 8:00 PM on July 14th. There was a photo in it. A man in a black sweater was driving but his face wasn’t captured in the photo. They could tell from the photo that the person had a good physique and was driving a nice car.</p>
 <p>The girl asked in WeChat, "Who’s that? Don’t tell me you’ve become some rich man’s mistress?"</p>
 <p>Ling Shuangshuang replied, "Hehe, I’ll reveal his identity later."</p>
 <p>"Tch, you need to keep it confidential even from me? Let's sever all ties with each other!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, I’ll give you a hint, his initials are NS."</p>
 <p>"NS? Who’s that?!"</p>
 <p>"Stupid, think about it again."</p>
 <p>After that, the two didn't talk again. The girl sent a lot of messages asking, "Are you there?" but Ling Shuangshuang didn't reply. Lin Dongxue thought, "NS? Nansen? Boys? Male god<span id="footnote-ref-81b3"><a href="#footnote-81b3">[1]</a></span>?!"</p>
 <p>"Yes, male god! It must mean that!" Xu Xiaodong agreed.</p>
 <p>"Police Elder Sister, who is it? Is Shuangshuang missing? Or has she been..." She covered her mouth in shock.</p>
 <p>Since she had agreed beforehand, Lin Dongxue told her, "She was killed."</p>
 <p>The girl turned pale in fright. "Was... Was it the person in the photo who did it?"</p>
 <p>"We are still investigating. Please send this photo to me and don't talk about this carelessly before the case is solved."</p>
 <p>"Okay, I know. Please get justice for her," the girl said sadly.</p>
 <p>After getting the photo, the two of them gave the girl a lift. Then they returned to the bureau and pushed open the door of the office. Chen Shi was actually watching a TV program and recording things down in a small notebook while watching.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue stepped forward and smacked him on the shoulder. “You’re so relaxed. You’re actually watching TV?!"</p>
