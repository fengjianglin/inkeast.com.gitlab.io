 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao sat upright obediently, furrowed his brows, and kept looking at Lin Dongxue, seeming to think that Lin Dongxue would save him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi confirmed that the camera in the room was operating normally, and then asked, "Let's get to the point. What did you deal with tonight?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao bowed his head in dismay. "Didn’t you already see it all? Do you police not take breaks? It’s already so late, but you’re still turning over trash cans? How did you know that I was the one who threw it away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Talk! What is it?!" Chen Shi increased his tone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wigs and women's clothing..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What did you use it for? Don't tell me that you have some sort of special hobby!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes. You saw through it at a glance. I do have such a hobby. Look at how I was born with fair skin and tender meat. After I put on women’s clothes, I look even better than women. When I was in university, I was famous for being a cross-dresser, so I usually dress up at home to show off." Lu Hao kept gesturing with his eyes towards Lin Dongxue, hoping that she’d believe his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi snorted. "Which students know about it? We’ll call to verify it right now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s not needed right? It's not a glorious thing or anything..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you want to waste our time, let’s see who wins in the end."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"All I’ve said is true!" Lu Hao still insisted stubbornly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue whispered, "This kid isn’t honest. Do you want to let him stay here alone for a while?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, this kind of person is actually very easy to deal with!" Chen Shi raised his voice. "Lu Hao, we went to your place of work in the afternoon. We heard that you’ve been working in Lieyang for several years and your salary has been raised a few times. If you aren’t honest, we’ll put you in the detention center for a night to reflect and your file would be stained. Think about which barber shop would want you in the future!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao was frightened with cold sweat. He rubbed his hands constantly, but still didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A person who wasn’t even afraid of losing his job indicates that there was something that’s making him act brave. If they wanted him to speak, they’d have to smash his last glimmer of hope. Chen Shi said, “Don’t be disillusioned. That ten million yuan is now safe in the Public Security Bureau!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What?!" Lu Hao was shocked, and then his whole person became deflated. "She was really killed?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I told you she was missing."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This reaction seemed real. It seemed that Lu Hao didn’t know what happened last night, so the person Chen Shi saw wasn’t him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, Peng Sijue's DNA identification had been sent to him this afternoon. Although he couldn't determine the identity, he knew that the owner of the blood was an AB blood type woman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi followed the hypothetical steps and continued to speculate, "Did Lin Hui agree to share the money with you? You know that the money didn’t come from legal means, but you couldn’t resist the temptation, so you still agreed… I noticed that in the bag you threw away, the wig was the same as Lin Hui’s hairstyle. She made you look like her and led the people who were after her away, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Every time he talked, it looked like one of Lu Hao’s spinal columns had been taken away and he’d slump on the chair even further. He said, "I thought she used me at first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Tell me about it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Actually, my relationship with Lin Hui is a bit like eating soft rice<span id="footnote-ref-7ca3"><a href="#footnote-7ca3">[2]</a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. I earn about 4,000 a month. It’s not even enough for me to spend. She has a salary of over 10,000 and her year-end bonus was hundreds of thousands. In my eyes, she is a bit of a rich woman. I usually tried my best to make her happy when we were together and she would often give me money to spend. Of course, I can’t say that I’m clinging on to her. I’m sincere towards her, though I don’t know how she feels about me... When she met me a while ago, she asked me if I wanted to get rich. I said of course I wanted to. Later, she told me something that I couldn't believe. She said I could get 10 million, but someone was trying to kill her and she needed my help. At first, I thought it was a joke. Would such an exaggerated thing happen in reality? Then, I met her that day. She really brought 10 million yuan over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What date was it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"September 8</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Just at my friend’s. She has the key." Lu Hao bit his finger. "I was stunned to see the money. I have never seen so much money in my life. I asked her where it came from, but she refused to say anything. We were very happy, lying in the money and having sex over and over again..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Talk seriously!" Lin Dongxue interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"We discussed how to hide the money together. At the beginning, we planned to hide it in my friend's place. Later, we thought about getting a few cards and storing them in batches. We wouldn’t have to worry about eating and drinking in this life..." Lu Hao showed a smile like he was looking forward to it. Then, he snapped back to reality. "On the morning of the 9</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Lin Hui said that someone was following her. That group of people had great skills and they could find her anywhere she went. She was really scared, so I thought of a trick. We’d make them go off-track. One of us would lead the bad guys away while the other went to hide the money. So, I bought wigs, clothes, bags, and a bunch of joss papers. We put some real money on the joss papers and it looked just like the real one in the bag. We marked the bag of real money.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That afternoon, the group of people appeared near the housing district. She carried a bag and left, while I carried another bag away. I had already prepared 20 cards registered in other people's names in advance. The purpose of me pretending to be a woman was to prevent the ATM security camera from recording me. However, when I went to deposit the money, I found out that I had the fake money on hand! I croaked inside. Lin Hui wouldn’t have used me, right? So, I called her, but she didn't answer. I thought about it over and over but I didn't understand. I was the one who came up with the plan. If she wanted to deceive me, there was no need for her to have come to me in the beginning. And she wasn’t that kind of person anyway!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I ran out of options, so I waited for her at the appointed place. When nobody came, I was very disappointed. In fact, until today, I was still hopeful. It wasn't until the police appeared that I knew that things went sour. That’s why I quickly disposed of these things. I didn't expect you to find out... Haii!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi asked, "What mark?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We just made a small mark on it with a pen."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The real money is marked?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Were you in a hurry at that time?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We were. Lin Hui said that the group of people had guns. Then, she took a bag and left."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi thought about it, went out, and took the bag found from his house. He showed it to Lu Hao, "Is this the mark?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh?" Lu Hao hugged his head regrettably. "I'm a pig brain. The mark is right, but I put the money in the wrong bag!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi seemed to understand why Lin Hui didn’t hesitate when she abandoned the money in the car. She thought it was fake money!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What a big whoopsies.</span></p>
