 <p>Everyone stopped their cars and surrounded the river. As they watched the SUV sinking into the lake slowly, everyone's heart sank.</p>
 <p>Liu Hong got out and swam vigorously towards the shore. He stretched out his hand and said, "Officers, please pull me up!"</p>
 <p>A policeman dragged him up and immediately put handcuffs on him. Liu Hong was drenched and said, "It's just drunk driving. Isn’t it fine if I just confess to that?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue walked over and said, "Is there something in your car? Do you think you’ll be fine as long as it sinks into the lake?”</p>
 <p>Liu Hong shrugged. "Then, I’ll have to trouble you to retrieve the car. Next time, I’ll take you for a ride, okay beauty?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was so angry that she wanted to hit him. She immediately contacted the appropriate personnel and was ready to salvage the car. Chen Shi said, "No, it's just a front! If Liu Hong's handling of the bodies was so terrible, he would have been arrested already!"</p>
 <p>"Where is Li Biao right now?"</p>
 <p>"Go to the kennel!"</p>
 <p>The two hurried to the kennel. The kennel and the sunken car were located at the opposite ends of Long’an City. It took three hours to arrive.</p>
 <p>Hearing the sound of a car, many dogs began barking from within the kennels. The two got out of the car and found the big iron gate closed. Chen Shi gritted his teeth, returned to the car, and took out a crowbar. Lin Dongxue warned, "That's too brazen! Let’s go over the wall!"</p>
 <p>"There’s broken glass on top of the walls, are you sure? It will leave scars."</p>
 <p>"Then maybe just break the lock!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went back to the car again, put down the crowbar, took out two wires, and fiddled with the keyhole. After a few tries, the lock opened.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was surprised and asked, "You know how to break open locks?"</p>
 <p>"Can you keep it a secret for me?"</p>
 <p>"Okay!" Lin Dongxue thought to herself. <em>Why would he pretend like he doesn’t know how to open locks?</em></p>
 <p>The two turned on the flashlights on their phones and went into the kennels. The dogs barked a lot and Lin Dongxue was so scared that her heart was beating intensely. She held onto Chen Shi’s hand tightly.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi glanced at the staff roster on the wall. "Someone should be on duty today. Why isn't anyone in?"</p>
 <p>They looked at all the rooms that could be opened and didn’t notice anything abnormal. Chen Shi kept looking at the crowd of dogs. Suddenly, he went to a small room and knocked at the iron door a few times.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "What are you looking for?"</p>
 <p>"Remember the last time we came here? Remember how there was a ‘snow mastiff’ here?”</p>
 <p>"Yes!"</p>
 <p>"The dog is gone!"</p>
 <p>"The dog is gone?" Lin Dongxue realized, "You said two days ago that every time someone disappears, a dog needs to be buried!"</p>
 <p>"So Li Biao is still 'missing'!"</p>
 <p>The two went outside and Chen Shi searched carefully on the ground, occasionally picking up the soil and smelling it from time to time. In the wild countryside, it was quiet at night. There were strange cooing sounds coming from the forest. Lin Dongxue didn’t dare to let go of Chen Shi’s hand.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi suddenly fixed his eyes on a plot of land, squatted down, tilted his head, and said, "Look! There are drag marks!"</p>
 <p>The two followed this trail and found a piece of land that smelled like blood. It was obvious that the soil in that area was moved not too long ago.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi directly dug at the soil with his bare hands, and the bloody smell mixed with the smell of soil became heavier. Finally, a dead dog appeared. It was a skinned Tibetan mastiff that had been buried.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue covered her mouth subconsciously. Because the entirety of its skin had been peeled off, the dog's eyes and teeth protruded outside. It was particularly eerie in the middle of the night.</p>
 <p>"A piece of dog skin can let a person evaporate out of thin air!" Chen Shi mumbled. "How the hell did he do that?"</p>
 <p>"The Tibetan mastiff is very large. It must weigh at least a few dozen catties, almost the same as a person."</p>
 <p>"But there is still a big difference in shape unless the calves are sawed off and tucked into the stomach... Then, cover the body with dog skin and the human body becomes a dog body. What happens to the body though?"</p>
 <p>"Pet crematorium?!" Lin Dongxue guessed.</p>
 <p>"That's right!" Chen Shi grabbed Lin Dongxue's shoulders and shook her in excitement. "The pet crematorium! You don't need any formalities or certifications to pay for the cremation of the body! No one can recognize it after burning it into ashes!"</p>
 <p>"Is there such a place in Long'an?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi searched on his mobile phone. "There is one place. It’s been open for ten years. Let’s head over now!"</p>
 <p>On the way, Chen Shi called Peng Sijue and asked him to bring the testing equipment. Peng Sijue was delighted and hung up the phone without a word.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the pet crematorium, Peng Sijue, who had set off from the bureau, had already arrived first. The pet crematorium was naturally much humbler as compared to human crematoriums. It was a large courtyard house in the suburbs with a long iron chimney.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue looked at his watch. "I waited ten minutes for you."</p>
 <p>"Hurry up! Maybe you can find DNA!" Chen Shi hurriedly ran inside.</p>
 <p>At this time, the crematorium was already closed. Chen Shi desperately knocked on the door for five minutes before someone finally opened the door. "What’s going on? If you want to cremate your pet, then come again tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>"Police!"</p>
 <p>"Huh?!"</p>
 <p>After letting them in, Chen Shi asked, "Did anyone come here to cremate a Tibetan mastiff?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" The staff member recounted. "It was really big and the fur was snow white. It was so beautiful. I thought that it was a pity to burn it and it’d make for a nice stuffed display.”</p>
 <p>"Who came to cremate it?"</p>
 <p>"An aunt!"</p>
 <p>"Where did you burn it?"</p>
 <p>"We have an oven here."</p>
 <p>When they got to the incineration room, Chen Shi began to open the furnace for inspection. The staff member said, "No, no. The furnace is still hot. Opening it will burn you."</p>
 <p>"What about the ashes?"</p>
 <p>"They didn't need it. We’ve poured it down the back of the mountain.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi insisted on searching, but found that all the bones of pets at the back of the mountain were pet bones. There were also unburned bones. He picked it up but Peng Sijue said, "It's useless. DNA can’t be detected through ash!"</p>
 <p>"Why not just test it out!"</p>
 <p>"The human body is divided into organic matter and inorganic matter. DNA only exists in organic matter. The cremation temperature is extremely high up in the thousands. All the organic matter is burned away. The rest is calcium, phosphorus, and carbon. What do you think can be tested?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi punched angrily at the ashes.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "There are unburned bones in there. Can we restore anything?"</p>
 <p>"Even if you build a complete body, how can you prove it to be a person’s? Unless the entire skull is restored. But the chance is infinitely close to zero!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stood up. "This is the simplest and least flawed method I have ever seen!"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue countered, "It is not without flaws. There will definitely be DNA left on the way here. Even the slightest evidence is proof. We will block this place tomorrow and I will bring people here to investigate carefully."</p>
 <p>"Okay, let's communicate it to them!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi told the staff that they needed to block the place for investigation. The staff member opened their mouth in surprise, "Why? Was the dog smuggled? Just for a dog?"</p>
 <p>"Don't ask. Just give me your boss's contact information."</p>
 <p>"Okay, just tell him yourself."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi seemed to have seen the number before. He asked, "Who is your boss?"</p>
 <p>"Surname Liu."</p>
 <p>"Full name!"</p>
 <p>"Liu Hong."</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this name, the three of them were stunned for a full ten seconds!</p>
