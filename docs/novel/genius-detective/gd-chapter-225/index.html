 <p>After getting in the car, Chen Shi said, “I used to have a neighbor who was a boy that didn’t hold a proper job. He later got a girlfriend. She was a very polite little girl and greeted me every time they saw me downstairs.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue listened quietly.</p>
 <p>“The boy was obviously not a good guy. I heard him hit the girl in the house several times and I knocked on the door. The girl said that it was all right, even though I could hear her crying. I thought they’d break up. Who knew that what would come would be even worse. That boy often brought home some bad friends and played lots of music that concealed the girl’s cries all night!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue covered her mouth. “What did they do to her?”</p>
 <p>“I don't know!” Chen Shi shook his head. “I called the police. After the police came, the boy said it was a joke and the girl corroborated their story. Eventually one night, the girl knocked on my door with a lot of blood on her. I called the police again. However, before the police arrived, the boy wiped the blood on the girl clean with a rag and then burnt it. The girl told the police that nothing happened. When she spoke, the boy kept glaring at her. The police couldn’t do anything and got ready to leave. I couldn’t hold it in any longer and beat the boy up in front of the police.”</p>
 <p>“Then you were taken away?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, the one thing I can't tolerate are bad guys running around freely in front of me. But there are things that really make people feel helpless when the law can’t touch the criminals.”</p>
 <p>“I guess you must really love Batman.”</p>
 <p>“I like movies, but I don’t really agree with that kind of extrajudicial justice. I still believe in the law. The law is indeed imperfect, but it’s as close to perfect orders and rules as it can be for human beings. If we went to the other extreme just because it’s imperfect, I believe that would be quite stupid. All the splendid and brilliant systems of human beings were gradually improved from imperfection to perfection. The transition must have had lots of detours and required the dedication of countless people.”</p>
 <p>“I'm curious. How many days were you detained for this?”</p>
 <p>“Seven days. I lost some money as well.”</p>
 <p>“I see. Are all the bad spots on your criminal record left because of these reasons?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi waved his hand around. “Those? Those were because I was young and crazy. I don't want to talk about it!”</p>
 <p>The two arrived at Li Biao's residence At the same time, Xu Xiaodong and the local police also arrived. In front of Li Biao's house, the police said, “If the lock is opened and there’s no trouble, this would be breaking and entering. Are you sure about this?”</p>
 <p>“We can’t help it. This is an emergency and he’s in trouble! If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility for it!” Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>“That's it then!”</p>
 <p>The police took the lock opener and knocked off the lock with a bang before pushing the door open.</p>
 <p>Li Biao's files show that he was divorced and living alone. The furnishings in the house indicated that he was a person who loved to play. He had a complete set of mahogany furniture with various treasures and antiques placed on the multi-shelf. Chen Shi said, “People who come in need to remember to put on shoe covers. Don’t touch anything on the scene unless you have gloves on.”</p>
 <p>There was a shoe cover machine at the door. Everyone put shoe covers on and looked around.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi inspected the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom to confirm that no outsiders had come in.</p>
 <p>“Look!” Xu Xiaodong found a photo that read “Photo of commemoration for the Fourth Group of Taoxing Town’s Rongchang Manual Tractor Factory” that dated 1997. Chen Shi swept over their faces one by one and said, “These people are all missing. It includes Liu Hong and Li Biao. They used to be colleagues. “</p>
 <p>“Why couldn’t we find this clue?” Lin Dongxue was annoyed.</p>
 <p>“It may have been a private factory without formal procedures,” Chen Shi explained.</p>
 <p>In a drawer, they found a stack of banknotes with a lot of camphor pills sprinkled on it to prevent insects. Chen Shi held it in his hand and pulled out a piece from the middle. “This is last year's money. This money should have been received by Li Biao recently... They don’t have consecutive serial numbers. The person who sent the money was very careful!“</p>
 <p>“Did Li Biao blackmail Liu Hong with something?” Lin Dongxue speculated.</p>
 <p>“Is Li Biao really missing?” Xu Xiaodong asked.</p>
 <p>“Find him! We must find Li Biao!” Chen Shi ordered.</p>
 <p>So they went back to the bathing center and asked for all the surveillance footage around the area. They checked these until 10:00 in the evening. Finally, they saw Li Biao going to an intersection and getting onto an SUV.</p>
 <p>They could only see the first six digits of the SUV's license plate in the footage, so they called the vehicle management office and checked all the possible numbers. Among these ten numbers, Liu Hong's name popped out.</p>
 <p>“The car is Liu Hong's! Li Biao is in danger!” Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>“Is he stupid? There are police watching him. Why would he get in Liu Hong's car?” Xu Xiaodong said.</p>
 <p>“No, wasn't Liu Hong at home during this time?” Lin Dongxue wondered.</p>
 <p>At the moment, they could only continue to investigate the car. The three stayed late at the traffic management bureau and finally found the surveillance video of the car. At 8:10, the car disappeared at a fork at Huancheng Road and has never appeared again since.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong was so sleepy that he yawned and stretched endlessly. Lin Dongxue couldn't stand it anymore either. Chen Shi stared at the screen thinking. Lin Dongxue said, “Let’s continue checking tomorrow. I will file a case formally with Captain Lin.”</p>
 <p>“I'm worried it's already too late.” Chen Shi shook his head. “Go home and rest!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi naturally didn't sleep well. The next day, Lin Dongxue used a lot of words to persuade Lin Qiupu to formally file the case. A large amount of police resources was given, making the investigation easier.</p>
 <p>The investigation confirmed that Li Biao did have a lot of property and assets that were inconsistent with his income and expenses, proving that he had a secret profit channel.</p>
 <p>Li Biao had a little lover. The girl claimed that Li Biao had been drunk once and boasted that he had helped his buddies deal with dead bodies. The police suspected that Li Biao was probably involved in the disappearance cases surrounding Liu Hong in the early years.</p>
 <p>Someone was constantly keeping watch at the traffic management bureau. That night, when everyone got off work, Lin Dongxue received a phone call. “We found the car! It’s now on Rongcheng Road!”</p>
 <p>“Is it stopped or is it moving?”</p>
 <p>“Moving. It’s heading south. Maybe it’s going to Liuyang Road.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue immediately called everyone who could be mobilized, including Chen Shi and Xu Xiaodong, to chase after the car.</p>
 <p>When they came to Liuyang Road, they finally found the car. Lin Dongxue was very excited and looked around the area. Chen Shi asked, “What are you looking for?”</p>
 <p>“A police siren light!”</p>
 <p>“I have it in my car!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue told others to put on the police lights and the four police cars chased the SUV down. The others gave way to them and the scene was spectacular.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi relied on his several years of driving experience to overtake a few cars consecutively until he was side by side with the SUV. Lin Dongxue rolled the window down and shouted, “Stop! Police!”</p>
 <p>The other side also rolled down the window and inside it was actually Liu Hong. He said with a smile, “We meet again, beauty!”</p>
 <p>“I’m telling you to stop!”</p>
 <p>“Ah, my ears aren’t good. I can't hear very well! Ark...” Liu Hong drew up some phlegm. When she realized what was to come, Lin Dongxue quickly rolled up the car window and the thick phlegm splattered on the glass.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was furious. “He’s too arrogant. I’m going to force him to the side!”</p>
 <p>“Don't get too agitated! We’re going at a very fast speed. We need to be careful not to cause an accident.”</p>
 <p>Liu Hong's car drove faster and faster, and the police cars behind him couldn’t help but slow down. Chen Shi kept watching the GPS and suddenly said, “Oh no! He intends to...”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his sentence, only a bang was heard as the car drove straight into the lake, causing a huge splash.</p>
