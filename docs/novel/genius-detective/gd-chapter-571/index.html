 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Teacher Liu didn’t look like he was lying. Chen Shi asked again, “How are Teacher Lin’s interpersonal relationships?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Interpersonal relationships? She is the precious daughter of the deputy director of the Education Bureau. She is only 24 years old this year and a recent graduate. We all said in private that she’s like a fairy normally, teaching her students to sing every day as well as looking after her assigned class. She never got involved with other things. She just plays with her phone in the office when she’s not in class. She often traveled. When she came back, she would bring souvenirs for us. Every teacher in the office got a share, and she had a good relationship with us! Oh, right...” Teacher Liu pointed to a workstation. "Mr. Yan, who teaches Chinese, is dating her right now. They look like an ideal couple when they stand together. Although Teacher Yan is from a normal family, his grades have been very excellent from an early age. He came first in our school interview. This year, he also participated in the evaluation of excellent teachers and gave open classes for the experts of the Education Bureau. The response was very good. He can be described as the top talent in this cohort of young teachers."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Was there any conflict between them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What conflict can they have? I think that they’re sweet with each other every day, like those lovers in romance novels."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Where’s Teacher Yan?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"He’s in a class!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi looked around and noticed a shelf with some trophies and awards on it. Teacher Liu explained, "These are the honors our grade has received over the years. See? The first place in the province’s recitation contest and the first place in the composition contest. First place in the International Mathematical Olympiad..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Several awards were received by this student named Tao Yueyue!" Chen Shi said deliberately. Lin Dongxue secretly smiled behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Teacher Liu beamed. "Tao Yueyue was in my class. She only transferred here last year. At the end of the last semester, she took first place in the entire school. This child is extremely smart, and she understands everything as soon as she’s taught. We said in private that a little Einstein has appeared in class. In the future, she’d certainly get into the top school in the province.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"This is due to the good education provided by the teachers."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Teacher Liu concealed his joy and humbly said, "All the credit belongs to the parents. Teachers only provide support.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"If my child is like this, that will be nice." Chen Shi sighed. His eyes fell on a trophy. The dust on the trophy had been wiped off, so he put on gloves to remove the trophy and handed it over to the Little Zhou from the forensics team who had come with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Everyone watched Little Zhou spraying reagents on the trophy. Chen Shi checked all around the place, focusing on obscure corners.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi lay on the ground and found several hairs. Under a table, he found a stain that looked suspiciously like blood stains. He quickly asked Lin Dongxue to come over and have a look. Lin Dongxue squatted down and lit up the area with her mobile phone. It wasn’t easy to take a picture of that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She whispered, "When you mention Tao Yueyue, you look very happy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I didn't know that she had participated in so many competitions in school at all."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It’s clear that you don’t pay attention to her normally!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Actually, I don't want her to be too outstanding. Her childhood days will go by in a flash. People who were too outstanding as children will often have psychological gaps later."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"‘If my child is like this, that will be nice!’" Lin Dongxue imitated his previous tone. "You were clearly secretly pleased!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Finally, a clear picture was taken, showing a drop of blood with some gray residue on it, like paper ash or something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, everyone in the office exclaimed. Little Zhou had found residual blood on the bottom of the trophy. Chen Shi asked him to preserve the bloodstains under the table as well as on the trophy. Then he said to Teacher Liu, "The office may have to be cordoned off first. Do all of you have other places where you can do your work?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It's possible to squeeze in with the other teachers. This must be relayed to the dean."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Please do so."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Police Officer, this... this won’t be a criminal case, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The discovery of blood stains doesn’t mean that it’s a criminal case. Don't think too much about it." Although he said so, Chen Shi had already concluded in his heart that Teacher Lin was likely not in this world anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When leaving the office, Chen Shi bumped into an "acquaintance" in the corridor, and he said to the others, "Go ahead first!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Tiannan was holding a pile of teaching documents, and wearing rimmed glasses. He sneered slightly, "Long time no see!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What trick do you want to play this time?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Do you suspect me as soon as someone disappears? Mr. Chen is too sensitive! I'm just an ordinary teacher."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Stay away from Tao Yueyue."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Haha, that kid is very clever. I set a question in the last exam and she was the only one in the whole class who got it right. This brilliant cleverness is as precious as a diamond. I think she will become an excellent successor!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Hearing him talking about Tao Yueyue, a flood of blood rushed upwards into Chen Shi’s brain. He said, "If you let me find out that you have any schemes targeting her, I will risk everything to settle scores with you. I am not a police officer, and you’re just a mortal!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Tiannan shrugged. "I really want to see what meticulous tricks you can design."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two passed each other by, and Lin Dongxue was waiting for him at the stairs. She asked, "Who were you talking to?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The teacher from Yueyue’s class."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Was he also praising her?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yeah, it was all praise." Chen Shi smiled, thinking about what Zhou Tiannan had just said. Did he play a part in this case? There was only one big question mark in Chen Shi's heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When he walked downstairs, the bell rang, and the students ran out. Some courageous students came to ask what had happened. Several of them surrounded Xu Xiaodong and wanted to see his gun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi stopped at the door of Tao Yueyue's class. Tao Yueyue just happened to be looking out. He beckoned and Tao Yueyue ran out. "Uncle Chen, you mind revealing your identity?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Haha! I'm not Batman. What identity is there to be revealed? This time, you were well-informed."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I was just mentioning it casually to you. I wanted to know what had happened, but I didn't expect that you and Sister Lin would be dispatched. Is it a big case?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"At present, it won’t be a big case. Rest assured, the truth will come to light soon."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Did the teacher disclose that we would go on vacation soon?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Teacher Liu praised you just now but you’re already thinking about the holiday. Didn’t the Golden Week holiday just end?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue pouted. "Do you need me to help you ask around about anything?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What can you inquire about?" Chen Shi changed his tone to the one he used for asking a witness, "Miss, do you have any clues that you can provide for this case?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue thought for a while. “Teacher Liu lost a pack of Zhonghua cigarettes and was still looking for the thief in class this morning."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That's it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Before the case is solved, any clue may be the key to the case." Tao Yueyue said maturely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, okay, thank you for the important clue that you’ve provided. I believe that with this clue the case will definitely be solved. I will come to your door tonight to say my thanks and invite you to eat at Pizza Hut, okay?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You’ll come back in the evening? I don't want to eat Pizza Hut anymore. I said that Pizza Hut was delicious once and you take me to eat there every time. Can we change to something else?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, you get to pick tonight."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At this time, the class bell rang, and Tao Yueyue returned to her class. Her classmates surrounded her and asked, "Tao Yueyue, is your father a criminal policeman?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Wei Zeng Mary also ran over, full of excitement, "Hey, hey, is your father really a criminal policeman? Didn't you say that he drove a taxi? You actually lied to me. Our friendship is over!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"He really drives a taxi!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You’re still fooling me? Humph, I’ll ignore you..."</span></p>
