 <p>In the interrogation room, Dr. Gao Ming repeatedly stressed, "That’s so funny. Why would I kill Du Ting? My relationship with her was so good, why would I kill her?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue quizzed, "At the time of the incident, what did you two do at the office?"</p>
 <p>"We chatted!"</p>
 <p>"She cried because you guys chatted?"</p>
 <p>Dr. Gao grabbed his hair anxiously. "She was the type of girl who loves to cry! What does it have to do with me?"</p>
 <p>"What did you two talk about? It is best to repeat it completely."</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay. About a week ago, she joked and asked, ‘Why don’t you be my boyfriend?’ At the time, I needed to conduct an operation and thought that she was joking. We usually make such jokes, so I said ‘Go die.’ I didn't think much of it at the time. However, later on, I heard the other nurses talking about how much she cried in the office. That’s when I knew that this little girl actually felt that way about me. Officers, don't look at how I’m thirty. I really don’t have much love experience. I have been in school for more than 20 years! To be honest, I also like her very much. I thought about it for a few days and decided to accept her. That day… That is, the day of the incident that you were talking about, while she was patrolling, I called her into the office and took out the small gift I had prepared, hoping to formally associate with and date her. Maybe she was too happy, but she cried.</p>
 <p>"Is that all?"</p>
 <p>"Why would I lie to you?!" Dr. Gao was annoyed.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue received an internal call made by Peng Sijue. He asked her to come take the DNA identification report. Xu Xiaodong was interrogating the doctor with Lin Dongxue and made a trip to get the report.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong went to the forensic department. Peng Sijue was alone as everyone else had gotten off work already. There was a document on the table. Peng Sijue sipped his coffee slowly and said, "The DNA in the nails of the deceased is consistent with the suspect."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong was excited, "Sure enough, it’s him!"</p>
 <p>"What about Chen Shi?"</p>
 <p>"He went to the funeral in order to check the death of the old man."</p>
 <p>"He was in a hurry earlier and forgot one thing. The pillow had traces on the front as well as traces on the reverse side."</p>
 <p>"Fingerprints?"</p>
 <p>"I took a photo."</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue took out a photo that had just been printed out. After seeing it, Xu Xiaodong was a bit surprised. It was not a fingerprint of a person. It clearly showed that both hands were covered together. From the sizes, a man’s hand was underneath and a woman’s hand was on top.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong said, "Is this enough evidence?"</p>
 <p>"It’s not. Let's say I push a pillow on your face now. Your face would show on the pillow and my fingerprints would show on the other side. However, that doesn’t mean that I killed you. An autopsy would provide the most reliable evidence.”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong was a bit regretful. He knew that the old man was killed, but there was no way to prove it.</p>
 <p><em>I don't know how Brother Chen will reverse it this time, but I believe that Brother Chen can certainly find flaws and evidence.</em></p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong gave the DNA identification results to Lin Dongxue. Lin Dongxue widened her eyes and had a wave of adrenaline within her. She stood up and walked in front of Dr. Gao. Xu Xiaodong also walked over. Dr. Gao nervously retreated. "What are you doing?"</p>
 <p>"Roll your sleeves up."</p>
 <p>"I can roll them."</p>
 <p>Dr. Gao rolled up one of his sleeves but there was no injury on his skin. Lin Dongxue asked him to do the same with his other sleeve, but nothing could be seen either.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong made a sudden discovery. "Turn your face around."</p>
 <p>"Why? What is this?!” Although Dr. Gao complained, he complied with the request anyway.</p>
 <p>"Hey, here!"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong pointed at the skin between the doctor's ear and his jaw. Some of the skin was scratched.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Your DNA was found on the deceased’s nails and your face is scratched. How do you explain that?”</p>
 <p>Dr. Gao angrily shouted, "You police are too rash and sloppy! What can this prove?"</p>
 <p>"This can explain that you killed her!"</p>
 <p>"Bullshit."</p>
 <p>"Then you need to give us a reasonable explanation."</p>
 <p>"I remember now. She slapped me in the face."</p>
 <p>"You’re making this up on the spot?"</p>
 <p>"You little officers really do say things that make people angry. Are you trying to frame me because you can’t catch the real murderer?”</p>
 <p>"You just said that you established a relationship with her. She was so happy that she started crying. Why would she slap you in the face then?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know! Maybe she was ‘so happy she slapped’?!”</p>
 <p>"What are you saying? If you still don't tell the truth, I can't help you."</p>
 <p>Dr. Gao cried and finally admitted, "Fine, I confess. It’s because I tried to have my way with her at the time. I had already given her a present and we established that we would date each other and formally associate with each other. That is, she’s my girlfriend now, so I should be able to exercise a boyfriend’s rights of touching and pinching… Don’t look at me like that. I’m just talking about my psychology at the time. Then, she slapped me and cried as she ran away. I really can't understand the woman's mind!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue looked contemptuous. "She is dead and you aren’t sad at all."</p>
 <p>"I admit that I just wanted to play. The little girl was born so beautiful, so I developed these intentions. How can I date a nurse anyway? My dad would kill me. You police love forcing out everything ugly out of people’s hearts. Are you guys happy now? Are you satisfied with this?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue didn't know if this was a lie. Looking at Xu Xiaodong, Xu Xiaodong said, "I feel like it’s the truth."</p>
 <p>Dr. Gao felt like he found a confidant and said with excitement, "Men understand men."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue made a call, asking someone to detain him first. As he was being taken away, Dr. Gao desperately shouted, "I’m not a murderer! I’m not a murderer!"</p>
 <p>In Lin Dongxue's heart, she couldn't make up her mind. She didn't dare to let him go. According to the regulations, she could only detain him for 24 hours. If she didn’t make any progress, she would have to let him go.</p>
 <p>She called Chen Shi and it was really noisy on his side. It took some time for the noise to die down. Maybe Chen Shi went outside to answer the phone. Lin Dongxue reported, "The deceased has the doctor's DNA in her nail and the doctor reported that he got slapped in the face because he tried to have his way with her. He’s being detained at the moment. What about you on your end?"</p>
 <p>"I am still eating. There is no progress. Are you going to work overtime?"</p>
 <p>"I was thinking of going to the hospital again with Xiaodong to find some evidence."</p>
 <p>"Can you go back to my house? Tao Yueyue is alone at home and I’m guessing she hasn’t had dinner yet.”</p>
 <p>"How long does it take to get there and come back? I’m afraid I can't go."</p>
 <p>"It seems that she has to eat instant noodles tonight."</p>
 <p>On the other side, at the restaurant, Xue Chengyi was giving a thank-you speech to the guests. Apart from relatives and friends, there was also Xue Chengyi’s business partners and friends. Chen Shi hadn’t been able to find any information or evidence and was a bit depressed.</p>
 <p>Xue Chengyi used his pillow to kill his father. Maybe he just didn't want to spend huge medical expenses. Then, this would be a spontaneous murder. There would be no evidence to be collected here.</p>
 <p>But intuition told him that there must be other discoveries.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi’s eyes searched through the guests, and suddenly noticed a familiar person. Xue Chengyi’s little three<span id="footnote-ref-d503"><a href="#footnote-d503">[1]</a></span> actually came.</p>
