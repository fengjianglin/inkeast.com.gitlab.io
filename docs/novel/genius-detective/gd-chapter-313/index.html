 <p>It was May 16th. A few days had passed since the operation between the father and son. The operation was very successful. The first thing Wang Haitao did when he was discharged was to visit Chen Shi.</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao arrived quite early and Chen Shi was called out before he could get enough sleep.</p>
 <p>Compared to when they first met, Wang Haitao was now full of energy. His face was rosy and his hair was neatly trimmed. Chen Shi said, “You don’t need to thank me. It’s all thanks to the police. You can thank them for it!”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Chen, I stayed at your house for a few days. Let me invite you to breakfast to show my appreciation!”</p>
 <p>“I won’t go if it’s too far.”</p>
 <p>“We’ll just go nearby.”</p>
 <p>The two went outside the community and Chen Shi pointed at a stall selling pancakes. “That place isn’t bad. Do you want to try it? You don't have this in Yunnan!”</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Wang Haitao accepted easily.</p>
 <p>The two lined up behind the other customers. It took a long time to buy two pancakes. Wang Haitao also wanted to eat the spicy soup in the store next to them. The two sat down on small stools outside. Wang Haitao was eating spicy soup and pancakes with tears falling down his face.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Is it too spicy?” Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>“No, this may be the last day of my life to eat this kind of commoner’s food. I’m a little bit reluctant to let go.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi put down the vinegar bottle. “It seems like I don’t need to add vinegar. I feel sour in my heart already.”</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao smiled with tears falling. “I'm really not complaining without being sick. You don't know the situation in my family. My mother got along with an educated youth at that time and gave birth to me back then. I couldn't raise my head in front of outsiders my whole life. My family was so poor when I was a kid. I could only eat a bowl of rice noodles in the morning on New Year's Eve. In school, the clothes I wore were always patched up. I was laughed at by my classmates saying that I was a bastard who didn’t have a dad. When I looked for work, I kept hitting obstacles. When I looked for love, they would snob me. I’m not afraid of you thinking it’s a joke if I tell you this – I’m still a vir… Virgin!”</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao's tears fell into the soup and he sighed as he shook his head. “It seemed to be a dream and it seemed like I just time-traveled. My poor life suddenly ended, and I now have a super-rich father... Do you know what my father expects of me?“</p>
 <p>“Hoping you inherit his company?”</p>
 <p>“He asked me, but I said I don’t know how to do anything, let alone manage the company. Even this...” Wang Haitao pointed to the stall behind them. “I can't even run this small restaurant. So he said, ‘I don't hope for you to do anything, your two older brothers are gone...'“</p>
 <p>“It's your younger brothers!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it's my two younger brothers!” Wang Haitao smiled. “He said that my two brothers were gone and he didn't expect me to have any great achievements. He just wanted me to live happily. He made enough money for me to live out three lives and still have money to spare. If I don't want to inherit the company in my life, when he dies, he will sell all the shares and let me do whatever I want to do in the future. Even if I were to live as a playboy, he would be fine with that.“</p>
 <p>“Actually, you can be considered as a fool with fool’s luck. You know that he was partially responsible for his two sons ‘deaths’. He expected too much! By the time he got to you, his mentality had already changed. Actually, it’s pretty good like this. Don’t people live to be happy? Money can buy happiness, but most people mistake the goal and treat money as happiness. They try to make money all their lives, but they aren’t happy. “</p>
 <p>“Mr. Chen, talking to you is really easy and eye-opening!”</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t say that. I’m just casually talking about it... Do you have any plans for the future?”</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao smiled embarrassedly. “Nothing is planned. Now that my card has so much money, I don’t even know how to spend it. Do you have any financial difficulties?”</p>
 <p>“No, no!” Chen Shi waved his hands desperately. “I heard that there are a lot of poor mountainous regions in Yunnan. Why don't you donate to a few charitable elementary schools? You can help the old man to accumulate good karma and maybe he can live out a few more years.”</p>
 <p>“Good idea. I’ll let the secretary do it this afternoon... Mr. Chen, can you continue walking with me for a bit?”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Wang let’s stop here. I hope that you won’t repay me for anything. I was just trying to do my duty.”</p>
 <p>“I asked around. You’re not a policeman, so how does this count as your duty?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was speechless and really didn't know how to explain that he was just a taxi driver.</p>
 <p>After eating, Wang Haitao went to buy a pack of seven-yuan cigarettes, opened it, and said with emotion, “This is the last time in my life that I’ll smoke such cheap cigarettes...”</p>
 <p>“Don't continue to do these rituals to say goodbye to poverty, okay?”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Chen, why don’t you accompany me to the new house! I... I want to show it off to you! It's really big!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi’s expression drooped. “I'm just going to leave. I should leave.”</p>
 <p>“No, I didn't mean it like that. You are my first friend in Long’an and probably the poorest of my friends in the future. I cherish you very much!”</p>
 <p>“The two of us... Our fate will probably end here! You will have many friends in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Don't!” Wang Haitao's face was hurt. “Don't look down on me because I'm rich now, okay? Maybe one day, you might have a rich father as well. You never know with luck.”</p>
 <p>“Who are you scolding?”</p>
 <p>“That’s not what I mean...”</p>
 <p>After being forcefully dragged by Wang Haitao, Chen Shi was brought into a car. The car was of course a luxury car, but Wang Haitao didn’t know how to drive, so he had a driver.</p>
 <p>When the luxury car departed from the gate of the community, the stall owners selling pancakes and spicy soup were shocked. They asked the people around them whether the people who just got in the car were the people who had just eaten there.</p>
 <p>Watching the scenery passing by the window, Wang Haitao smiled and said with emotion, “This is much more comfortable than a bus... I regret it. I should have taken the bus. This may be the last time in my life that I’ll be able to take a bus.”</p>
 <p>“You’re late to the life of a rich second generation. If you want to sit in a bus in the future, you can just buy one to sit in!” Chen Shi spat.</p>
 <p>When they arrived, Wang Haitao said, “You can get off first, I'll pay... Oh, I forgot that we don't have to pay!”</p>
 <p>When they got to Wang Haitao's mansion, it could be seen that the house was completely new, but there were no servants around. Wang Haitao said, “I haven't lived here yet. I don't know how it feels... Mr. Chen, look! This is a bathroom. It’s so big!”</p>
 <p>“You don't need to let me know. I won't come.”</p>
 <p>“This house was given to me by my father. I don't intend to live here. I plan to go to his side to take care of him. The woman who poisoned him has already been sued. It is inevitable that a big tree will catch a lot of wind and I’m worried more people with bad intentions will arrive. I think I’ll worry less if I stay by his side and take care of him.”</p>
 <p>“Oh!” Chen Shi couldn’t really give any lifestyle advice to people who were rich.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao fetched a big red book and a key. He grabbed Chen Shi's hand and said, “Mr. Chen, I'll give you this house as my thanks!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi opened his mouth and was shocked for a whole half minute...</p>
