 <p>“I think the murderer has clearly expressed what he wants to express. He’s avenging Duan Lin and will continue to kill people in the future!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi expressed his opinions in the car.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Although I think so too... but we should still wait for the identification results to come out!"</p>
 <p>"We don't need to wait for identification for everything. It’s good to have a mind of one’s own!"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue who was sitting in front said, "Someone means that my existence has no value!"</p>
 <p>"Aiya, Old Peng, don’t take your seat based on your number,<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-725#footnote-94f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> okay?" Chen Shi said, "By the way, I want to ask you about something. Which parts were Duan Lin divided into?"</p>
 <p>"The head, upper chest plus left and right upper arms, left forearm, right forearm, pelvis plus left and right thighs, right calf, left calf, abdominal viscera, heart and lungs as well as other thoracic viscera."</p>
 <p>"Thank you. You see? Little Wei had his left calf cut off. I have a bold idea. I think what he received was the left calf, and that the corpse parts they received were death notices."</p>
 <p>The nine guys had been reluctant to talk about which part each person had received.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "I don't understand why they don't want to say which part they had received. It doesn’t affect anything? Like with that Little Four previously, he was willing to talk about all the nasty things they did. However, he refused to talk regarding this matter no matter what."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "I was also thinking about this and suddenly discovered that we have always had a blind spot. How did they know that the corpse in their hands came from a girl named Duan Lin? Of course, for the one who received the head, it would have been obvious at a glance. For the remaining eight who received the hands, feet, and internal organs, it would have been impossible for them to know!"</p>
 <p>"Ah!!!" Lin Dongxue suddenly realized. "They want to hide who received the head. But why? Is this important?"</p>
 <p>"It’s the murderer's test!" Chen Shi pointed out with a piercing gaze. "The murderer doesn't know who killed Duan Lin, but he has a suspect in his heart. This suspect received the head. This person only needs to recognize Duan Lin and the person who killed Duan Lin would definitely be him. Having a guilty conscience, the 'suspect' himself realized that something bad was about to happen, so he did two things. The first was to destroy the face of the deceased, and the second was to make the other eight people conceal it together."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue thought for a while and said, "Is there another possibility that the 'suspect' had received another corpse&nbsp;part? For example, if Duan Lin had a birthmark on her chest? Just think. These nine people usually showed off their new girlfriends in the group. When we first asked Zhang Xiao to come in for questioning, he knew about Duan Lin, and Little Four also knew about Duan Lin. This shows that the information between them was publicly shared. Maybe there was a characteristic of Duan Lin that only her boyfriend knew about. This person also knows that the other party is testing him, so they got everyone to keep which part they received a secret!"</p>
 <p>"Hahahaha, very meticulous!" Chen Shi praised Lin Dongxue's imaginative ideas. "If this is the case, I have a new idea. It was the murderer who ruined the face of the deceased. Even though the face of the deceased was unclear, these nine people still knew who she was, proving that the person who received the 'special part' is her boyfriend!"</p>
 <p>"But how did the murderer know they knew?"</p>
 <p>"Hmm..." Chen Shi was also confused. Yes, from what channel did the murderer obtain the information? He suddenly thought that the murderer might be one of them.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi wanted to ask for Peng Sijue's opinion, "Old Peng, what do you think?"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue was motionless in the front seat, and the driver said, "Captain Peng is asleep."</p>
 <p>"Fuck!"</p>
 <p>Back at the bureau, Chen Shi couldn't wait to go out to investigate the case, and visit the remaining eight people, but Lin Qiupu repeatedly emphasized, "Wait for the appraisal results!"</p>
 <p>The first result was that the fingerprints and blood stains on the cell phone of the deceased Little Wei were all his. Many files on the cell phone had been deleted, but they were restored by technical means.</p>
 <p>Everyone sat in the conference room and "appreciated" some videos from the deceased's mobile phone.</p>
 <p>After watching one of them, Lin Qiupu said, "Turn it off! Turn it off!"</p>
 <p>All of those videos were unsightly. It turned out that the deceased had secretly videoed his sexual encounters. There were dozens of self-produced, self-directed adult videos that he personally acted in, and the "heroines" were always different.</p>
 <p>"Disgusting scumbag!" Someone commented from a dark corner.</p>
 <p>"Who said that? Xiaodong, was it you?!" Lin Qiupu glared.</p>
 <p>"It wasn’t me..." Xu Xiaodong looked innocent.</p>
 <p>Then there were a bunch of pictures. These pictures were of him sitting in a luxury car with an expensive mechanical watch on the hand holding the steering wheel , posing in front of some scenic spots (mostly in Europe and the United States), or participating in sports like golf.</p>
 <p>When the mobile phone photos were magnified dozens of times on the white screen, it was easy to spot the flaws. Many police officers said, "Photoshop. The directions of the shadows on the face are inconsistent!", "It was stolen off the web. The photo’s dimensions are wrong and the watermarks below have been cropped out."</p>
 <p>The above were all deleted content. Lin Dongxue curiously said, "Why did they delete these things?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, the most important thing for a man to do before he dies is to wipe his hard drive. The deceased not only wiped his phone, but also hid it in his shorts, so he has a high level of awareness!" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"Don't be disrespectful to the dead." Lin Qiupu said.</p>
 <p>"Yes, respect the dead scum." Someone said from a dark corner.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu glanced at Xu Xiaodong in helpless fury. Xu Xiaodong said innocently, "It's really not me this time... nor was it me just then!"</p>
 <p>"A police officer should behave like one. Don’t shoot your mouth off!" Lin Qiupu reprimanded.</p>
 <p>Next were the chat logs. Opening the WeChat account of the deceased, everyone was shocked. The female netizens in it were marked as "Five-star Prey - Lili", "Three-star Prey - Little Ai", "Three-star Prey - Little Ai's Mom", "Don't dare to engage - President Wang", "Slept with her already - Ah Juan".</p>
 <p>If the content of the chats weren’t informative, they ignored them.</p>
 <p>There was a conversation segment between him and Zhang Xiao, which was unexpectedly serious.</p>
 <p>Little Wei: Brother Xiao, you’ve deleted the third intake’s lecture record in the group sharing area.</p>
 <p>Brother Xiao: If it’s deleted, it’s deleted. It’s quite possible that the police will check our mobile phones. Delete them all and we’ll make them again later.</p>
 <p>Little Wei: The police are so annoying!</p>
 <p>Little Wei: By the way, Little Four will treat us to a bath tomorrow.</p>
 <p>Brother Xiao: Little Four will treat us to a bath? Where?</p>
 <p>Little Wei: White Sand Pools.</p>
 <p>Brother Xiao: Look at the place he picked. It’s actually a respectable bathhouse.</p>
 <p>Little Wei: Haha, Brother Xiao wants to go somewhere that’s not respectable?</p>
 <p>Brother Xiao: Only stupid cunts spend money to play with women!</p>
 <p>Little Wei: Hahahaha.</p>
 <p>After reading it, Chen Shi said, "It seems that this conversation had taken place on April 2nd, and Little Four and the deceased were fairly close. He’s worth visiting again."</p>
 <p>"We have to see that little hooligan again?" Lin Dongxue frowned. "Talking with him &nbsp;takes so much energy."</p>
 <p>"Now that one of them is dead, if we don’t handle this well, he might be the next one. I think he should be a bit more honest!"</p>
 <p>"Ah, what are you talking about? What do you mean by the next one?" Lin&nbsp;Qiupu&nbsp;was shocked.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I forgot to say that I was discussing this with Dongxue in the car. I think the murderer may have his next target."</p>
 <p>After Chen Shi finished telling them about his speculation, Lin Qiupu frowned. "There’s no evidence for that!"</p>
 <p>"We can't wait for three or four of these people to die before we slowly conclude that this is a serial killing. The murderer's meaning is clear as day. He wants to chop off a part of each of these nine people."</p>
 <p>"The appraisal hasn't come out yet, but you’re in such a hurry?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked helpless. "The appraisal won’t be finished today, but the murderer may still act tonight. Can I go and visit them again?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu reconsidered it and said to everyone, "Visit them again! Tell them the news of Little Wei's death!"</p>
 <p>1. It’s a Chinese idiom that means jumping out and assuming that a criticism or comment is about you.&nbsp;</p>
