 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The corridor instantly became chaotic. Zhang Jinlei squeezed Xiao Ran's neck and pushed her down onto the ground. He roared, "It was you who killed her! You killed her!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Several policemen hurried over to drag him off, but Zhang Jinlei was surprisingly strong and they couldn’t move him, even with several people. In that moment, a terrifying potential burst out of him. Xiao Ran’s eyes had already rolled back and her entire face had changed color while her body twitched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi picked up an aluminum trash can in the hallway, walked over and slammed it violently against Zhang Jinlei's head. He fainted and collapsed onto the ground on top of Xiao Ran.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tears ran from Xiao Ran's closed eyes. She murmured, "I'm sorry".</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was relieved, but Lin Qiupu glared at him and quickly stepped forward to check Zhang Jinlei's condition. Fortunately, he had only fainted. He chided Chen Shi, "What would we do if you had killed him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, it was out of legitimate defense!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu shook his head helplessly and ordered the two of them to be taken to the hospital, especially Zhang Jinlei, who had to be guarded closely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was tired and hungry, but the large stone that had weighed on their hearts had finally been lifted. The six-year serial murder case was finally over. Lin Qiupu said with emotion, "Unexpected. It was really unexpected. The two criminals actually lived under one roof. Did they know about each other?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"They didn’t know for sure, otherwise Xiao Ran wouldn’t have testified that Zhang Jinlei wasn’t at home on the evening of the 6</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin&nbsp;</span><span>Qiupu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was silent for a while. Chen Shi asked, "What? What sentiments would you like to express?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Love is a terrifying emotion."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"No, I think it's his personal problem. Even if Yan Qilin was alive and together with him, they would have eventually&nbsp;</span><span>broken</span><span>&nbsp;up. Their relationship wasn’t great... Six girls had appeared before him. He wasn’t moved by them and sent them to hell instead. He only has that dead person in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span>Is his love very grand and heroic?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I don’t think so. He just loves the person in his heart. He’s intoxicated by this pilgrim-like self-satisfaction. Putting it simply,he only loves himself. He wanted everyone to know his pain. This is an extreme and narrow type of selfishness!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you think that no criminal can be justifiably forgiven?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There’re a few exceptions, but this one is definitely a beast in human skin."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I suddenly remembered a senior who I admired very much. It’s not known whether he’s dead or alive, and his whereabouts are unknown. I wonder if he also wants to tell me: ‘Don't forget me!’?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi snorted disdainfully at his sentimentality. "I think you should forget him. Don't you have me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get lost!" Lin Qiupu glowered at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi ignored him and greeted Lin Dongxue who was coming out of the office, "Dongxue, let’s go out for supper. We’ll have a big meal tonight and sleep in tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, the case is finally closed, Brother, let's go!" Lin Dongxue happily held onto Lin Qiupu and Chen Shi's arms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi delivered on his words. He slept and watched TV at home the next day. He had been so busy this summer that he nearly died. He refused to participate in the follow-up investigation of this case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He heard that over the past two days, the people in the bureau were about to go crazy from the torture. As long as Zhang Jinlei was conscious, he would shout from his detention cell, "Xiao Ran, I’ll kill you!" He shouted until his throat bled but refused to stop. He also engaged in several forms of self-mutilation, until everyone was about to fall apart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This person was completely hopeless, but the police's duty was to send him to the detention center. The rest of his life will be dealt with by ruthless legal procedures and he would be removed from the world like dross.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue sent a text message to tell Chen Shi that the family members of the deceased had gone to the bureau and asked to see the criminal who had killed their daughters. They were sincere and cried painfully, but the police could only refuse these requests. The only consolation they could provide was to promise to notify them of the date the court trial will start.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi replied, saying that he hoped this kind of tragedy wouldn’t happen again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, sometimes I really want the criminal police to be unemployed forever and have these cruel things never happen again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you’re unemployed, I’ll support you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, by the way, accompany me somewhere today!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two went to meet Yue Chao. They had previously agreed to tell him the truth. After listening, Yue Chao's shock was indescribable. He said, "I thought Zhang Jinlei was just extreme and stubborn, but he actually did such a thing!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's really hard to believe. This is also the weirdest motive I've seen since becoming an officer." Lin Dongxue said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haii, at least we’ve finally found out the truth. It’s been hard on you all. Thank you for making a trip to tell me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm still curious what kind of girl Yan Qilin was. The girls said that she was a bitch, but the boys thought that she was an angel. I know that asking you will certainly not yield the correct answer, but I still wanted to ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Um..." Yue Chao thought for a long time, then chuckled. "Actually, I’ve already forgotten what she was like and what attracted me. I just vaguely remember the feeling of first love. To me, she was just a part of my past, a part of my youth. Of course, I love my current girlfriend more. After all, the living is always more important than the dead!"</span></p>
