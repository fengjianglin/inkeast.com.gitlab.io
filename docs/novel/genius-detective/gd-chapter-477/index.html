 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue went back first and handed the evidence they obtained to Peng Sijue. Peng Sijue held it in his hands to examine it for a moment. "This is not human tissue. To be precise, it’s the excrement left after insects had eaten it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can you detect the DNA from it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's a bit difficult. I'll go back to the site to get another sample."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah, you don't know the situation. There are people living there. They’re a family of three. If you aren’t worried about the trouble, you can go. I won’t bother with this anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that time, the Traffic Management Bureau called and said that the unit that the license plate number was registered to was a health club. After hearing the name and address, Chen Shi understood. He said to Lin Dongxue, "You don't need to go anymore. It's a prostitution place. Let me go in for a secret visit."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh? A secret visit?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't look at me with that kind of look. Do you think I’d go and actually make a purchase? That time when I was caught, it was actually Wang Daji who went there. Do you still not believe me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I didn't say anything. Why did you suddenly start to justify for yourself? Is it your guilty conscience?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I surrender! I surrender!" Chen Shi smiled. "You rest here. I’ll come back soon."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Everyone’s so busy here. How can I be so thick-skinned as to rest here alone? I’ll go with you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi had no choice but to agree. Lin Dongxue asked while on the road, "How do you know it’s that kind of place as soon as you hear the name?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't forget that I’m a driver. I’m more familiar with Long’an than you guys. When the night is quiet, there are often male passengers who go to such places. Wouldn’t I be able to guess just from that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So it turned out to be like that! Do you want to contact the local police to come over and sweep the yellow?<span id="footnote-ref-cca0"><a href="#footnote-cca0">[2]</a></span>"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi waved his hand. "Don't cause a commotion as soon as we go. We need to first uncover the corner and see what’s happening inside first. It’s not too late to sweep the yellow after the investigation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue thought out loud, "Is the missing person a prostitute? When I heard Captain Peng say that the deceased had syphilis in the morning, I was thinking whether she would be in that kind of occupation. It reminded me of a case."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Even if you don’t tell me, I know. The 714 case."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Correct!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The 714 case was relatively well-known in the city and even the whole country. This happened a few years ago. A criminal gang specifically kidnapped sex workers and forced the sex workers to tell them their bank card passwords by using torture methods. They took away all their assets, killed them cruelly, dismembered them, and threw the body parts away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The gang committed crimes everywhere. There were six<span id="footnote-ref-3888"><a href="#footnote-3888">[3]</a></span> sex workers killed in total. They targeted women who weren’t from the city. Even if they disappeared, people who knew them wouldn’t report the crime. Plus, they generally had some savings no matter what. Both the mentality and motivation can be said to be extremely insidious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, the gang was arrested in Long’an. Song Lang hadn’t participated in the case, so Chen Shi wasn’t very clear about the specific situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He parked the car outside the health club and told Lin Dongxue that he would come back in a while before going upstairs. After entering the club, an employee asked Chen Shi what service he wanted. Chen Shi asked, "What services are there?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ordinary services include foot therapy, massage, and health care."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Listening to you, there are unordinary services then?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Sir, were you introduced to us by a friend?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I was introduced by a friend."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then, this gentleman should know what services there are then?" The employee lowered his voice. His tone was full of hints.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi smiled and asked, "What price?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"One thousand yuan an hour."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's a bit expensive."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It isn’t. Our service is good, the environment is good, and the ladies are of high quality. Shall I take you to a room to have a look?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi stood still. "Can I name someone?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You can."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I want to find a girl named Little Li."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The employee’s expression changed slightly. Then, he took Chen Shi to a room. After a few minutes, the people who came in weren’t girls, but a few strong men wearing unkind looks. They surrounded Chen Shi and the big man with a ponytail took the lead. "Is she in your hands?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, actually, I came to find her too."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you playing with me?!" The man grabbed Chen Shi's clothes and widened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi took out a document and pushed it in front of the eyes of the big man. When the man saw the words "Public Security", he immediately spread his hand as if he’d been shocked by electricity. Then, he immediately reached out to smooth the folds on Chen Shi's clothes, accompanied with a smiling face. "It turns out you’re an officer, you... What have you come here for?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I already said I’m looking for someone. Didn’t you go to Anhui Community a month ago to find someone named Little Li? How did you guys know she was there?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh, no..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi sighed. "Don't act anymore. Would we have come here without evidence? To tell you the truth, Little Li may no longer be here anymore. We are investigating a homicide case. I really don't care if you’re involved in prostitution. We aren’t in charge of that either. Please cooperate with us on matters of life and death. You also want to find Little Li, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ponytail pondered for a moment and told his men to go out. Then, he asked Chen Shi to take his phone out and put it on the table. He was afraid that Chen Shi would secretly record them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He said, "Officer, Little Li's original name is Li Qiuli. To be honest, she was here as a prostitute. She’s worked for over a year. She suddenly stopped coming to work at the end of May this year and we couldn’t get through to her phone. So, we looked for her everywhere."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why are you looking for her? Afraid she ran away?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ponytail waved his hands over and over. "No, we’re not forcing them to be prostitutes. I will tell you this. The girls who are here come voluntarily. Think about it. How much can you earn at work in a month? And how much can they earn here in a month? It’s completely voluntary. No matter how you put it, we’re an enterprise that needs to be responsible for our own brand and employees. One of them is missing, so of course we’d have to find her. Otherwise, who would want to work here in the future?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes, I understand. By the way, how did you find that community?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Through inquiries."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can you inquire in such a detailed manner? Even the house number was correct."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What? Little Li was really missing there?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Answer my question first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ponytail stammered and admitted that there was a GPS on Little Li's mobile phone. Chen Shi’s logic followed this train of information. It was likely that the young ladies here were secretly monitored to prevent them from running away. However, he didn’t expose this matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "Understood. You’re also worried about her safety."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes. We’re a company and we care about our employees... Has Little Li been found? I mean, it’s okay even if she’s dead or alive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We might have found her, but we’re not sure. Do you have her specific details? It’s best to have an ID number."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ponytail covered his mouth. "She... She really got killed? Who did it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We're still checking, but it's definitely not the man you were looking for. He just lives there and knows nothing, just like you guys."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ponytail nodded. "Wait a minute, I'll give you Little Li's details."</span></p>
