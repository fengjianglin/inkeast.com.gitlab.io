 <p>Lin Dongxue called the bureau and there were a few people still on duty. She asked them to send a police car over.</p>
 <p>There weren’t any abnormalities in the living room. There was a window on the right side of the living room. This is where Mr. Ma was interviewed by the reporters. A large tank of goldfish was kept below and the bedroom was straight ahead. A black cat came out with a meow, scaring the people who were inside.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, “Don't let it run away. There may be evidence on it.”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong coaxed the cat until he could pick it up.</p>
 <p>Walking to the bedroom, Lin Dongxue took a breath and the cameraman behind her yelped, almost dropping the machine to the ground.</p>
 <p>Mr. Ma was on the ground with blood all over his head. She knelt beside him to test his pulse and breathing. Both vital signs were gone. Lin Dongxue opened his eyelids and remarked, “The pupils are dilated. He’s already dead.”</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a lot of blood on the ground. There were some splashes on the wall but the bed and surroundings were clean.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue quickly left the bedroom and searched the kitchen, toilet, and even the large closet to determine that no one was hiding in the house. She was shocked. How did he get killed right under everyone’s noses when the window and doors were locked?</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong held the cat and asked, “Is this really homicide?”</p>
 <p>“It must be a homicide. Who could have posted the photo on Weibo?”</p>
 <p>“I think there may be a daring netizen with lots of skills. They couldn’t stand him, so they killed him.”</p>
 <p>“Don't talk nonsense!”</p>
 <p>“But fortunately, this cat survived...” Xu Xiaodong went to play with the cat. “What's your name?”</p>
 <p>After a while, the police car arrived at the scene, took pictures, took the body, and temporarily cordoned the scene. They would wait until the forensics came over tomorrow to obtain evidence, but the door lock was broken and someone had to stay and watch.</p>
 <p>Luo Haifeng offered, “It happened in our area, so I will stay and watch the scene!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, “No, you drove a police car. You have to go back to hand the car over back to the station. Just let the criminal police handle this… By the way, the reporters haven’t left yet.”</p>
 <p>Luo Haifeng said. “Thank you for your hard work then. I'll deal with reporters.”</p>
 <p>“Remember to pay attention to your words.”</p>
 <p>“I understand.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue told Xu Xiaodong to bring the cat home for one night and bring it to the bureau tomorrow. Xu Xiaodong said, “Are you going to be okay staying here at the scene?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, “It's not uncommon to stay up late!”</p>
 <p>“I'll stay with you!”</p>
 <p>“No need. Just go back to rest and come over early tomorrow... I’ll ask Chen Shi to accompany me.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Chen is coming? Okay, I won’t be a light bulb then.”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong ran to drive his car over, parked beside the crime scene, and let Lin Dongxue stay in the car at night since it was warmer.</p>
 <p>Then, he left with the cat.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue hesitated to call Chen Shi. She prepared to dial his number a few times but eventually gave up. Although she really wanted to be accompanied by someone, she thought that this case didn't look easy to solve. She’d let Chen Shi have a good rest tonight so that he could help solve the case tomorrow.</p>
 <p>After everyone else left, Lin Dongxue sat in Xu Xiaodong's car, playing on her cell phone and just waiting for time to pass. At 2:00 AM, she couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>
 <p>She lowered her seat and lay down for a while, when suddenly there was a dark shadow outside the window that knocked on the window with their fingers, startling Lin Dongxue. She used her mobile phone’s flashlight to shine on the figure and saw Chen Shi's smiling face. She used to think Chen Shi looked too rough around the edges, but after a while, she felt like he looked very manly.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue happily opened the car door and Chen Shi said, “Move in.”</p>
 <p>“I just made my seat warm, so why don’t you go and sit on the other side? How inconsiderate.”</p>
 <p>“Then, why don’t you sit on my lap?”</p>
 <p>“Could do!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi squeezed in and Lin Dongxue rode on him. The two looked at each other tenderly. Chen Shi said, “You have something on your face.”</p>
 <p>“Where? Where?”</p>
 <p>“It seems to be here.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi got closer and closer and the two could feel each other’s breath. Naturally, they began kissing. They went from shallow and short kisses into a deep and intense kiss. Then, Lin Dongxue woke up…</p>
 <p>Remembering her dream, she covered her hot face in embarrassment. Was this a wet dream?</p>
 <p>But it was a beautiful dream. If she slept in a more comfortable position, then she might not have woken up so soon. But if she didn’t wake up, what would she have done with Chen Shi in the dream?</p>
 <p>When she thought about that, she covered her face and smiled with her cheeks blushing all the way to her ears.</p>
 <p>Someone knocked on the window outside and Lin Dongxue was startled, saying subconsciously, “Chen Shi?”</p>
 <p>Through the glass, the person didn’t hear her and said, “Officer Lin, it's me!”</p>
 <p>Using her phone to shine a light on them, it turned out it was Luo Haifeng. Lin Dongxue rolled down the window and said in surprise, “Officer Luo, why are you here? It's only four o'clock in the morning.”</p>
 <p>“After taking a nap back at the office, I was worried, so I came here... I thought you were with a colleague, but you’re here alone. Isn’t it inconvenient for a single girl to be here alone?”</p>
 <p>“No... It’s nothing.”</p>
 <p>“Would you like to go to the bathroom? There is a fast food restaurant open overnight.”</p>
 <p>“Can I please trouble you to stay here and monitor the scene for a while?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go together. There’s no one in the community. If the killer is still nearby, you will be troubled.” Luo Haifeng patted his waist. “I explained the situation with the station and now I have my gun with me.”</p>
 <p>After going to the restaurant to deal with her biological needs, Lin Dongxue saw Luo Haifeng had bought some food and drinks at the counter. He said, “Eat something to refresh you.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was very embarrassed. “I’ll give you the money back.”</p>
 <p>“It's okay. It's not worth much anyway.”</p>
 <p>Most of the time when men were nice to her, they usually had a motive. Lin Dongxue didn’t want to owe him anything, so when Luo Haifeng was about to pay with Alipay, she took out a hundred yuan and handed it to the counter. Luo Haifeng said, “Why be so polite?”</p>
 <p>“It's better to draw a line between public and private matters.”</p>
 <p>The two returned to the car and Lin Dongxue began eating in boredom while Luo Haifeng was looking for topics to talk about. Lin Dongxue answered curtly but professionally while feeling like the awkwardness was very difficult to bear. It felt better to stay alone in the car.</p>
 <p>She wondered whether she should call Chen Shi multiple times before finally rejecting the idea. After all, he wasn’t a policeman, so this wasn’t his duty.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll let him have a good rest so that he can help solve the case tomorrow</em>. <em>If it’s like that, then my efforts tonight would be worth it.</em></p>
 <p>“Officer Lin, this might seem a bit sudden, but do you have a boyfriend?” Luo Haifeng said.</p>
 <p>“I do!”</p>
 <p>“But Officer Xu said...”</p>
 <p>“Don't listen to him. He doesn't know anything about me.”</p>
 <p>“So... Is your boyfriend a policeman?”</p>
 <p>“It’s temporarily confidential.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay!” Luo Haifeng who stumbled into a nail looked like he was left in a dazed state.</p>
 <p>It was finally getting bright outside. Those who have ever stayed up late would know that you get the most sleepy in the beginning but you’re much more awake in the middle of the night. However, when the sun rises, your whole body gets tired.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue leaned on the chair and closed her eyes for some rest. She dreamed of Chen Shi again. Chen Shi was knocking on the window and Lin Dongxue rolled down the window to complain, “Why did you only get here just now?”</p>
 <p>“I got here shortly after getting the message. Did you stay here overnight?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I was so cold!” Lin Dongxue thought to herself that since it was a dream, she should hurry up and progress in case she’d wake up again. “I missed you so much!”</p>
 <p>“Huh?!” Chen Shi froze.</p>
 <p><em>The development of this dream seems a little strange...</em></p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue suddenly found that she was covered with Luo Haifeng's coat and was holding her mobile phone in her hand. She had texted Chen Shi and attached her address before falling asleep.</p>
 <p>She desperately pinched her face and the pain was so clear that she regained her senses. <em>This is not a dream. It’s reality!</em></p>
