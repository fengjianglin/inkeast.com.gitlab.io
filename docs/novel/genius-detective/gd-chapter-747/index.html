 <p>“Miss Gu, Miss Gu..."</p>
 <p>"Ah?!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue called out a few times before Gu You recovered from her daze. Lin Dongxue asked, "Can Chen Fengde's daughter still be found now?"</p>
 <p>"I... I don't know. I haven't contacted her since then."</p>
 <p>"How strange. Chen Fengde's file clearly doesn’t mention a single word about his daughter<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-747#footnote-7cb0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a>." Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi.</p>
 <p>"Let's go upstairs and take a look!" Chen Shi was still thinking about it. "Let’s understand how this man became like this."</p>
 <p>Although it felt impolite, since they were already here, Lin Dongxue agreed. Gu You said she would wait downstairs.</p>
 <p>A wooden staircase led to the upper floor. There were several pairs of shoes under the stairs. It seemed that they needed to take off their shoes. So, the two took off their shoes and walked up to the attic.</p>
 <p>It was a normal bedroom upstairs. The sunlight coming in from the window shone brightly there, and the floor was polished smoothly. The little girl who had talked to them was sitting cross-legged in front of the TV watching cartoons with relish. The volume wasn’t too loud, and there was a woman sitting on the bed next to her embroidering something. She was slightly surprised when someone came up.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue thought to herself that the ambulance had just come and the movements were so loud, but the pair of mother and daughter didn't go downstairs to have a look?</p>
 <p>"There’s nothing worth investigating. You guys should go! My husband went crazy like this a long time ago." The woman was very young, and she was probably the woman who had an affair with Liu Tao back then.</p>
 <p>"Why not send him to a mental hospital? Why just torture yourselves like this at home?" Chen Shi went up, sat down cross-legged, glanced at the TV and said, "SpongeBob!"</p>
 <p>The little girl was indifferent.</p>
 <p>"Is the mental hospital a place where people should stay? Although my husband is crazy, he didn't go out to harm people, so staying at home isn’t so bad. The room below was given to him. He can do whatever he wants." The woman said with contempt.</p>
 <p>"Do you have a job?" Lin Dongxue asked.</p>
 <p>"We don’t, but we have savings. After his ex-wife died that year, he received a lot of insurance money... Don't look at me with that kind of look. Due to this incident, the police have constantly visited us. Her getting killed by a lunatic has nothing to do with my husband."</p>
 <p>"A 'lunatic' named Chen Fengde? Has your husband mentioned this person before?"</p>
 <p>"I have no impression of it."</p>
 <p>"Has he ever said anything regarding a deep dream pool..." Chen Shi wondered why he was asking this. Actually, he was also very curious.</p>
 <p>The woman tilted her head and thought about it. "He did have a 'supernatural power' previously and could control his dreams. He told me mysteriously that he could enter my dreams. On our third wedding anniversary, I said that I wanted to play in the Maldives. He said that we could go in our dreams without spending that money. At night, I really dreamed that he took me to the Maldives. The next day, he arrogantly said, ‘Was it fun going to the Maldives?’ What the fuck can I feel from a dream?! One summer’s afternoon, we both lay on a mat and slept. I woke up from the heat. When I looked at him, he was smiling in his sleep. His smile looked so perverted. Then, I saw his little stick slowly harden and all that dirty stuff came out. His shorts were all wet. I woke him up and asked him what strange dreams he was having. He was very upset... Then, I had some suspicions about this low and impudent guy. A man in his forties was having wet dreams every day. I have to help him wash his underwear as well. Fuck this motherfucker’s cunt. He must be fucking a woman in his dreams, cheating as he lay next to me. Fuck, how come men are all so impudent?!"</p>
 <p>This woman, who seemed to be gentle and quiet, was so powerful when she opened her mouth that even Chen Shi blushed. Chen Shi said, "He was just having sexual dreams. As for the dream regarding the Maldives, I think it must be that you really desired for it, causing you to dream about it at night."</p>
 <p>"I thought that way in the beginning as well." The woman sighed. "That is, until he knocked up another woman in his dream. Can you believe it? He snuck into the other person's dream like a thief and had sex with her. Then, that woman got pregnant in reality, and she brought her baby to the door!"</p>
 <p>"What about the child?"</p>
 <p>"It's this little sinner!" The woman threw a pillow at the girl's head, but the girl continued to drink Vitasoy indifferently. "Seven years ago, a woman who looked like a vixen came to our house with her and said ‘I can’t raise her. I’m leaving after dropping her off!’ I have to fucking raise this motherfucking bastard that my husband had with someone else?! Whom do I owe this to?"</p>
 <p>"Are you sure it's not just ordinary cheating? After all, your husband has previously..." Chen Shi stopped talking so as not to offend the other party.</p>
 <p>"What motherfucking cheating? He doesn’t go out all day. His skin is as white as a young chick, and all his shit and urine are all in the toilet bucket. I even have to take it to the alley and pour it away for him. If he wants a pack of cigarettes, he’ll get me to get it for him! That woman was an actress. She filmed "New J Ping Mei". The actress's unmarried pregnancy ruined her career and she just left after dropping off the child. How could this fucker hook up with an actress? Through dreaming! I wrote to the newspaper and said that XXX had been impregnated by a wretched man in her dreams, and the child was born. The newspapers didn’t believe it and told me that I shouldn’t make stuff like that up. Fuck that motherfucker’s cunt!"</p>
 <p>"That...Can you not speak with so many letters<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-747#footnote-a88a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a>, please?"</p>
 <p>"If I don’t fucking use the letters, how can I fucking express my fucking anger over the years? Why did that fucking woman do something like this? This asshole made her feel so good in the dreams but he hasn’t fucking had sex with me in five years!"</p>
 <p>"Where did you go to watch ‘New J Ping Mei’? I haven’t been able to find the resources." Lin Dongxue changed the subject.</p>
 <p>The woman calmed down in a second. "I have Internet resources. I can send you a link later."</p>
 <p>"Thank you so much."</p>
 <p>"The drama was well filmed, but fucking watching that little bitch who played Li Ping'er made me so angry." She hit the bed, tossed things and became angry again, making Lin Dongxue think of werewolves on a night with a full moon.</p>
 <p>"I have a question." Chen Shi said, "Who did Liu Tao learn to control dreams from?"</p>
 <p>The woman shook her head. "I don't know."</p>
 <p>"Excuse me, who is Master Dream?"</p>
 <p>"Don't mention this name. When you mention it, he’ll get angry and say that mortals shouldn't mention this noble name. Motherfucker, if I knew how to learn it, I’d sleep with Daniel Wu every day. No one cherishes my beauty. That asshole made me so haggard... and fucking said all that. Fuck!"</p>
 <p>"Okay..." Chen Shi looked embarrassed. He noticed that the little girl had been looking at himself and asked, "Little girl, what do you want to tell us?"</p>
 <p>"It's fun to observe other people's misfortunes, isn't it?" The little girl still said something that didn’t match her age.</p>
 <p>"Are you going to school?"</p>
 <p>"I don't need to go to school. I can learn everything in my dream."</p>
 <p>"Dreams can do anything?"<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-747#footnote-2278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a> In order to test the truth of what she said, Chen Shi used his Chinglish after a long time.</p>
 <p>The little girl replied something that he didn't understand, and Chen Shi asked, "What did she say?"</p>
 <p>"She's scolding you in German. This little evildoer knows everything. She’s&nbsp;a sophisticate." The woman said.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was secretly shocked. Suddenly, Gu You screamed from downstairs.</p>
 <p>1. The author said “Cheng Fengde’s file clearly mentions his daughter in one word” which doesn’t make too much sense, so based on the grammar used, I believe the author missed one word and have changed this accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>2. Letters are used to replace the cursing in slang and when written over the Internet. E.g. QTMLGB&nbsp;</p>
 <p>3. Written in English.&nbsp;</p>
