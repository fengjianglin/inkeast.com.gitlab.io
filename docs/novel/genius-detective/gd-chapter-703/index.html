<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Each of the four men dressed increasingly showy, with colorful clothes and hair, various ornaments, tattoos, and jewelry on their bodies. Their chests and belly buttons were also exposed.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue sneered at this because one of the men who exposed their belly had no abdominal muscles at all. She didn't know where his confidence came from.</p>
 <p>When Xu Xiaodong's partner saw them leaning against the wall standing still, he yelled, "Show’s starting. Stand up and follow me."</p>
 <p>They were taken away to record their statements and Lin Dongxue asked, "What’s with these people?"</p>
 <p>"They’re people from Lan Xiao’s Company."</p>
 <p>"What? People like that are actually office workers?" Chen Shi was also surprised.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong answered, "I didn't believe it either but they’re actually from a logistics company. Do they dress like this to deliver couriers? I went to Lan Xiao's house and then went to a bar he frequented. I didn't expect these four people to be looking for him too. When they heard me inquiring about Lan Xiao, they immediately surrounded Little Zhang and I. Their attitudes were arrogant. I wondered if they would run away if I showed them my ID, so I subdued them first. Hehe, that fight was really fun... According to them, Lan Xiao is the vice president of their company. It’s been over two months since he disappeared and the company is looking for him."</p>
 <p>"Did they call the police?"</p>
 <p>"It doesn't seem like they have."</p>
 <p>"I think there’s most likely a problem with this logistics company. Otherwise, why wouldn't they call the police if someone went missing?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, all the employees look like hooligans. You can tell that they aren’t a serious company with one glance." Lin Dongxue echoed the sentiment.</p>
 <p>"I think so too. Let’s interrogate them and see." Xu Xiaodong said.</p>
 <p>"Xiaodong, hurry and put on some iodophor!" Lin Dongxue said with concern.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong touched the wound on the corner of his mouth and took a breath, but insisted that he was fine.</p>
 <p>When these people had their statements recorded, they all claimed that they were part of a serious company and that it was purely a personal preference to dress like this. As for why they didn’t call the police when Vice President Lan went missing, they evaded the question and made vague statements.</p>
 <p>From them, they learned that after graduating from high school, Lan Xiao worked in a loan shark company for a while, traveling here and there, then later settled in Long'an and joined the company.</p>
 <p>This company was put on the police’s suspect list, and they intended to investigate them after the case was over.</p>
 <p>One whole day had passed, and several clues were being followed up on. Chen Shi suggested, "Let’s get off work early today. The oysters yesterday were delicious. I bought some more online. They may be delivered in the evening. Do you want to come to my house to eat them?"</p>
 <p>"Sure, this lady shall reluctantly agree." Lin Dongxue smiled.</p>
 <p>"Wait a minute."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went outside to buy a lunch box and a bottled drink before sending it to the detention room. Xin Bai was doing yoga during this idle time, but his movements were extremely clumsy. Chen Shi commented, "Teacher Bai, it seems like you’re doing well here."</p>
 <p>"Since I don’t need to write, I feel like my whole body is relaxed!" Xin Bai giggled.</p>
 <p>"The readers would be sad if they heard that. I'll give you these." Chen Shi handed over the food and drink. Of course, the detention room also managed the meals. It’s just that the taste wasn’t bad as Chen Shi had eaten it before!</p>
 <p>The meal wasn’t given to him for nothing. When Xin Bai took the lunch box, Chen Shi suddenly asked, "Have you seen Lan Xiao recently?"</p>
 <p>"Lan Xiao?" Xin Bai was momentarily stunned. "I haven't seen that guy since I graduated from elementary school. That guy is just human-shaped trash. When I hear that name getting mentioned, my chest feels heavy."</p>
 <p>This was a genuine reaction. Since he was able to talk about Lan Xiao so calmly, it indirectly proved that Lan Xiao wasn’t the mastermind behind the scenes.</p>
 <p>The mastermind behind the scenes was cunning and meticulous. Judging from the methods he used to kill the two victims, his resentment was strong. Chen Shi speculated that he may be a single man with a cowardly appearance, mild obsessive-compulsive disorder, or hygiene-prone with a low-paying work.</p>
 <p>"Childhood nightmare!" Chen Shi agreed with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Yes, a childhood nightmare, haii!" Xin Bai opened the lunch box. "Can you buy me another bottle of Lafite 1982, or a "Science Fiction World" magazine. You can decide which one for yourself!"</p>
 <p>"You’re nuts!" Chen Shi smiled. Normal people would definitely choose the latter. "I’ll bring it to you tomorrow morning."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi drove home and went to the convenience store to pick up his delivered package. When he got downstairs from his house, he saw Gu You and Tao Yueyue squatting in front of the flower bed loosening the soil and planting flowers. Chen Shi greeted, "Miss Gu, it's rare to see you off work early like this!"</p>
 <p>"Aren't you the same? Is Officer Lin here too?"</p>
 <p>"Hello." Lin Dongxue greeted. She always felt a sense of inexplicable alienation when faced with Gu You.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "I bought a few catties of oysters. Would you like to come to my house for dinner later?"</p>
 <p>Gu You originally wanted to refuse, but Tao Yueyue persuaded, "Come on! Come on!" so she agreed.</p>
 <p>After entering the house, Lin Dongxue commented, "Yueyue likes Miss Gu very much."</p>
 <p>"She’s an orphan after all. She lacked the care of a mature woman during the process of growing up. In fact, I think it’s a good thing."</p>
 <p>"Can't she find a shadow of a mother from me? I usually treat her well."</p>
 <p>"I think you’re more like a sister to her."</p>
 <p>"I'm like a sister and you're like a father, so what is the relationship between us?" Lin Dongxue teased mischievously.</p>
 <p>"Why is your little head so dirty? Go watch TV and I’ll cook!"</p>
 <p>"Roger that!"</p>
 <p>Frozen oysters weren’t suitable for eating raw. Chen Shi planned to bake them. While the oven was preheating, Chen Shi prepared the ingredients and braised the rice. The two plates of stir-fried dishes made last night were directly heated up in the microwave.</p>
 <p>For someone who loved cooking, doing these things were easy and casual.</p>
 <p>While waiting, he sneakily took out his phone...</p>
 <p>Today, he took advantage of Lin Dongxue’s absence to do things and copied the original manuscript from Xin Bai’s computer to his mobile phone. Although he was a loyal supporter of the original version, there was a chapter in "The Detective of the Abyss" that wasn’t visible in the original version. That was the mysterious chapter 476!</p>
 <p>He wanted to know what the protagonist and heroine did that night!!!</p>
 <p>When he opened the document, he suddenly found a paragraph of unedited text at the front of it.</p>
 <p>"I don't know how long my spirit and body will last. If this text is discovered by him, I might be beaten to death, but I must write it out while I’m still conscious and still have the tiniest bit of courage to resist him!"</p>
 <p>"An uninvited guest broke into my house, claiming to be a hardcore book fan. Honestly, I didn’t want to open the door to let him in because I really don’t know how to talk to an admirer. I’m just an ordinary person who writes novels, but I don’t know how to refuse a smiling face. Thus, I let a demon in!"</p>
 <p>"Ever since that day, he has visited me every day, bringing discounted fungus and edamame from the supermarket. I don't like eating fungus at all! He very diligently called me 'Teacher Bai' the whole time. He cleaned the house, cooked, and even washed my underwear (It made me feel very ashamed). The atmosphere at home was very awkward and I felt the illusion of being watched. I was troubled to see a strange man sitting at my house eating and drinking, playing my game console, and watching my collection of cards. After he left, I would always wash the things he used over and over again."</p>
 <p>"Work is the only topic I can talk to him about. I once mentioned that I wanted to end the book. He was furious and said that I couldn’t let down an 'excellent work' like this. I was just the soil that cultivated this ‘excellent work’ and had no right to end it hastily!"</p>
 <p>"I changed the lock of the anti-theft door. He couldn't get in. He stood outside without saying a word. It was terribly scary. I was so scared that I trembled behind the door. I called the police, but he left before the police came. Two police officers came - one tall and one fat. They laughed when I told them about the whole situation and said they were envious of celebrities like me. They asked if it was a female fan. I seriously said that the person was harassing me. When the police questioned me thoroughly, it was only then that I discovered that it was my personal choice to let him in and invite him to dinner, so from a legal point of view, it didn’t constitute harassment. ‘As long as you explicitly reject him next time, it’ll be fine.’ The police said this, but they don’t understand that I’m as weak as a soft creature without carapace protection. Rejecting someone was as difficult as climbing up the sky. What should I do?!"</p>
