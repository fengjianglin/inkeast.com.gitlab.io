 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Qin Wanmu had his head covered with a black cloth bag. He didn't know where he was being taken. He shouted along the way, "Who are you? Why have you kidnapped me? If you want money, we can negotiate. I still have a lot of savings."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The person who escorted him was silent. The man's hands were like pliers, making his shoulder hurt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">With the sound of the door opening, Qin Wanmu was taken into a room, and the people behind him kicked him at the back of his knees. Qin Wanmu staggered onto his knees and his knees almost shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Old friend, is it comfortable living here?" the person behind him asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Qin Wanmu was confused and wondered if he was talking to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Woo woo!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Hearing this voice, Qin Wanmu was frightened and broke out in a cold sweat. The Silent Man was here!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I prepared a gift for you. I hope you like it. Do you know how much I want to kill him? But I know you want to kill him personally even more!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The man opened Qin Wanmu's hood. When he saw the ugly and horrifying face, Qin Wanmu was so terrified that even his liver trembled. He knelt on the ground desperately and kowtowed. "I was wrong! I was wrong! Please forgive me and don’t kill me. As long as you don't kill me, I can agree to any conditions!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao and Xu Fa retreated to the back of this basement and watched the show quietly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man sitting on the chair immediately recognized the voice. He stood up with tears in his eyes. Qin Wanmu looked up at the tall man as if he was looking up at a majestic judge. He was so scared that he couldn’t even cry anymore. Urine was flowing in the pants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Let’s make a bet of one hundred yuan. Do you reckon he’ll strangle him or smash his head in?" Zhou Xiao leaned against the wall and asked casually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I guess he’d be smashed to death. Only then can his hatred be vanquished!" Xu Fa said, "It would be great if I had a mortal enemy. It would be so blissful to kill them myself!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man was so agitated that he didn't know how to express it. He took off his clothes. Since he was too rough, he tore off the buttons, revealing his muscular but scarred body. He pointed to a scar on the liver area and howled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I'm not a human! I'm not a human! I’ve wronged you!" Qin Wanmu said as he began to slap himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man turned around, pointed at the scar on his back, and howled with tears in both of his eyes. Only those who have had a kidney removed knew the pain that accompanied it each day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Qin Wanmu also cried. "I'm sorry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man continued to point out the scars on his body to show him. Each time he pointed out one of them, Qin Wanmu would say sorry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Then, The Silent Man knelt down. Only in this way could his vision be level with Qin Wanmu. He put his hands on Qin Wanmu's shoulders. This movement made Qin Wanmu tremble with fright. He couldn't help trembling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Faced with the enemy that he had been pursuing for years, The Silent Man’s mood was very complicated. It wasn’t only the monstrous anger in his chest, but also the satisfaction of his wishing coming true, the emptiness of the end of his pursuit, and the desire to gain understanding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man stretched out his hands and hugged him. This movement surprised Qin Wanmu. Could it be that he was about to shake hands to make peace? The next second, he found that the opponent's strength was getting stronger and stronger, as if an iron hoop was holding him. He opened his mouth and couldn't breathe. His ribs contracted inch by inch under his opponent’s hug of death. When his body's endurance reached its limit, there was a movement from the depths of his body. Something had broken inside. Qin Wanmu raised his head. Blood spurted out from his throat like a fountain and his eyes began to have blood rushing into them as they became blood-red.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Qin Wanmu finally turned into a pile of dead flesh, The Silent Man finally let go. His body was covered with blood, and his eyes were full of tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao raised his eyebrows. Xu Fa was dumbfounded as he exclaimed, "Awesome!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man grabbed his clothes, stood up, put them on, and walked towards the door. Xu Fa stopped him. "Hey, you can't go out now. The police are looking everywhere for you... If you’re arrested, our location may be exposed!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man pushed Xu Fa away violently. In front of him, Xu Fa was as weak as a child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao stopped him. "Old friend, stay. You can live a better life with us. You have physical strength, and we have brains. We will make you the best criminal!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man howled and Zhou Xiao guessed what he meant. His expression became a little impatient. "Why? You have to go back to find the old blind woman? She isn’t your mother. Besides, the police must be monitoring around there right now. You’ll only get arrested!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Woowoowoo!" The Silent Man replied. His eyes were full of disgust towards these people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I rarely pull people into our gang so sincerely. Give me some face!" Zhou Xiao poked his chest. "Everyone here kills more people than you. You’re just a junior!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Old Three, he’ll be angry if you say that. He’s a fool!" Xu Fa lay on the ground reminding him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You’re not allowed to call me Old Three!" Zhou Xiao roared viciously, and then he turned to The Silent Man. "I will kill the blind old woman now and let your heart die!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As Zhou Xiao walked out, a huge force suddenly dragged him back. He was unable to move even an inch. The Silent Man had grabbed his collar and pulled back. Zhou Xiao fell from the door directly on the other side and was hit hard. He slid down like a painting, and he felt his blood surge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">What kind of weird strength was this? Zhou Xiao felt regretful for the guy. He was born with the qualifications of a criminal, but he didn't know how to use it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He drew out a knife. His face twisted as he said, "Asshole, no one dares to do this to me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What are you doing?" Xu Fa asked in horror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Kill him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao rushed forward and slashed out with his knife. The Silent Man slapped him and knocked him into the air. Zhou Xiao fell to the ground, clutching the ribs that seemed to be broken, burning with anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The Silent Man turned around to step on Xu Fa on the ground. Xu Fa screamed in fright, rolling away immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao rushed up from behind and stabbed him in the chest with a knife. The Silent Man howled in pain. He flung Zhou Xiao off as if he was taking off a hat and Zhou Xiao slammed to the ground heavily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He vaguely realized that these two weren’t good people. Just as he was about to step on Zhou Xiao to death, Xu Fa suddenly inserted a syringe into his leg. The poison flowed quickly into his heart. He knelt down while holding his chest and fell asleep forever.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhou Xiao wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and got up. He stared at the corpse of the little giant, stepping forward and stabbing him in angrily on his back while cursing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, okay, he's dead!" Xu Fa persuaded, "I’ve already said that it's not reliable to get him to join the gang. This fool doesn't understand anything."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What happened?" Ling Shuang walked into the basement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Xu Fa made a helpless gesture. "The interview failed!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who asked you to persuade him?!" Ling Shuang complained. "I should handle this kind of thing in the future."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Using your psychology?" Zhou Xiao looked at her viciously with a face full of blood. He pointed at her with a knife. "I don't need to use those tricks. If my personality and charm can’t conquer them, there’s no need for them to join us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What do you mean by personality and charm? Do you think you’re the boss?" Ling Shuang said contemptuously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Smelly woman, of course I’m the boss!" Zhou Xiao roared violently. The only response he got was Ling Shuang's indifferent gaze. Xu Fa quietly waved his hand and whispered, "Stop arguing, okay? That... How do we deal with the body?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Throw it to the police! Let them do something for once." Zhou Xiao pointed at Ling Shuang and said in a commanding tone, "You do it!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He clutched his injured ribs and walked out. Ling Shuang looked at The Silent Man’s huge body. Getting ordered to do something made her particularly unhappy. For what reason did women have no place in a criminal gang?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After a while, a sneer came to the corner of her mouth as she had a dark thought. "The corpse is really big. It's probably more than enough to hide something in it. Can you get explosives?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hey..." Xu Fa said in a panic. "Are you crazy? You can't take the initiative to provoke the police. We’re in a very dangerous situation right now."</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Killing one or two policemen would be blamed on Zhou Xiao anyway!" Ling Shuang smiled happily.</span></p>
