 <p>Chen Shi paced around outside the interrogation room. He had arranged for two of his interrogators with the strongest professional interrogation capabilities, but they still couldn’t get anything from Mr. Qin. The result was as Chen Shi expected. This kind of person is very tight-lipped, because once he talks, he may lose his head.</p>
 <p>"Be honest!"</p>
 <p>The interrogator's roar came from the room. Mr. Qin's uncooperative attitude had nearly driven the police mad.</p>
 <p>"Haii, as expected, things are not going so smoothly." Chen Shi sighed.</p>
 <p>"Don't be too impatient, we’re currently checking his bank accounts and searching his home. There will definitely be clues." Lin Dongxue cheered him up.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi glanced at Tao Yueyue who was sitting in the corridor. She was playing with a yo-yo. Due to the heat, she had taken off her military uniform top and wrapped it around her waist, revealing a black short-sleeved T-shirt. He said, “I’ll send the young girl back.”</p>
 <p>"I won't go back. I finally have an excuse to come out. Let me stay for a while. I'll leave after I’ve eaten." Tao Yueyue resisted.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said like a loving mother, "Let Yueyue stay for a while. When she goes back, she will have to march again with the hot sun shining on her body."</p>
 <p>"Yes, every day is the same. It’s boring. Why wasn’t the person who died the instructor of our class? We all envy the third class. They have no military training for two days." Tao Yueyue pouted.</p>
 <p>"Is this something a decent human would say?" Chen Shi had to give in. "Then you should go somewhere else, why don’t you go to my office to play on the computer for a while? The suspect will come out later and see you."</p>
 <p>"So what if he sees me? Will he take revenge on me..." Tao Yueyue thought for a moment. "By the way, if the murderer died, would he be willing to talk?"</p>
 <p>"Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
 <p>"If the person is already dead, there will be no need to hide things. You can get a fake body."</p>
 <p>"In your dreams. Do you think..." Chen Shi looked at Tao Yueyue. The murderer who ran away was short and petite, similar to Tao Yueyue, and they were wearing a mask. "Wait, this seems feasible!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, did I perform a meritorious deed? Can you help me apply for two days off?"</p>
 <p>"Don't even think about it. However, I can bring you out to eat something tasty on National Day."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue pouted again and Chen Shi said, "Let’s prepare something quickly!"</p>
 <p>An hour later, Mr. Qin, who had remained silent, was taken out of the interrogation room. Four policemen escorted him towards a certain direction. Mr. Qin raised his head and questioned, "What are you guys doing? Where are you taking me? Talk! If you dare to use certain tactics, be careful that I don’t sue you guys!"</p>
 <p>"Go and see if you recognize the bodies," a policeman replied.</p>
 <p>"I'm not going! I'm not going!" Mr. Qin wanted to turn back, but was dragged back by two police officers, kicking his legs mid-air in vain.</p>
 <p>"We’re not discussing this with you. Let's go!" The police put him back down.</p>
 <p>The lights in the autopsy room were deliberately turned down, and in the dimness, there were two "corpses" lying down. One large and one small, and they had very different body types. Mr. Qin was so nervous that his heart was pounding and he kept gulping down saliva.</p>
 <p>The police put on their gloves, took off the giant's mask, and asked, "Who is he?!"</p>
 <p>Mr. Qin said guardedly, "If I could tell you, doesn't it mean I know him?"</p>
 <p>"We already know your identity. Even if you don't say anything, you can be convicted without a confession. You might as well provide some information and win leniency for yourself."</p>
 <p>Another policeman said, "It doesn’t matter if you talk or not since the man has already been killed by our brave police officer. It’s only a matter of time before we find out his identity."</p>
 <p>"Yes, if he doesn’t cherish the opportunity, so be it."</p>
 <p>With that, the police were about to take Mr. Qin away. Mr. Qin said hurriedly, "Zheng Yu! His name is Zheng Yu! Nicknamed ‘The Bulldozer’."</p>
 <p>"What about the other one?" The policeman pointed to another corpse. She was dressed in black and wore a mask. She had bullet holes in her body, and her chest was covered with fresh blood.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qin didn’t even have the slightest doubt, and said dejectedly, “Nguyen Hui, nicknamed 'The Sparrow in the Palm'. She is a Vietnamese national. They’re husband and wife. Zheng Yu had bought Nguyen Hui as a mail-order bride from Vietnam, but Nguyen Hui actually had a criminal record back in Vietnam. Zheng Yu’s potential was developed under her 'guidance'. Thus this couple began to take on jobs."</p>
 <p>"What kind of jobs have they done?"</p>
 <p>"That I can't say. Since I can only..." Mr. Qin widened his eyes, and saw "Nguyen Hui" slowly sitting up, making a whining sound under the mask. He screamed, "Ghost! Ghost! "</p>
 <p>Mr. Qin, who had almost gone crazy with fear, was taken to the detention room, and he asked the police for a pair of clean underwear.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi ran to the autopsy room. Tao Yueyue took off her mask and giggled. Chen Shi said, "Are you crazy? Who told you to sit up?!"</p>
 <p>"I thought that since he had confessed, I would sit up and play a trick on him. He’s not a good person anyway." Tao Yueyue looked pleased with herself as she said this.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked helpless. "You are absolutely forbidden to do this kind of thing in the future. Absolutely forbidden!"</p>
 <p>"There is a future? You’ll take me to solve another case next time? Thank you, Captain Chen." Tao Yueyue saluted.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to make me die from anger?!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue stuck her tongue out and jumped off the autopsy bed. "I’m going to find Sister Lin to get her to take a few photos for me as a souvenir. This hitman outfit is pretty cool."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was completely speechless.</p>
 <p>Using Tao Yueyue’s peculiar idea, they successfully acquired information about the murderers, and found the address of the two through their household registration information. The police didn’t even have time to eat. They drove to a housing district, and found the property manager to bring them to Nguyen Hui’s apartment.</p>
 <p>Of course, they were going to trick her into opening the door by asking to check the water meter. When the property manager was standing in front of the door and about to knock, Chen Shi remembered that Nguyen Hui was a professional killer and would be very vigilant. He said, "Wait, make up another reason. Yes, looking for a dog! Knock on the neighbors’ doors first and ask if they’ve seen your dog. Do this loudly and everyone else should retreat to the corridor."</p>
 <p>Although the property manager was reluctant, he could only cooperate. After the police retreated, he knocked on the door of the neighbor's apartment and asked, "Hello, have you seen a dog that’s this big? It’s a Tibetan mastiff and poodle mix that’s dark yellow like poo."</p>
 <p>The neighbors said that they hadn’t seen it, and the property manager went to knock on another neighbor’s door. "Hello, have you seen a dog that’s this big..."</p>
 <p>At this moment, the door in the middle opened, and a small woman in a white cheongsam walked out. She looked taken aback, because the police were all in the corridor and could be seen at a glance.</p>
 <p>The woman’s gaze suddenly sharpened. She dragged the property manager into her arms, placing a fruit knife that suddenly appeared in her hand against his neck. As she was too short, she could only stand on tiptoes and shout, “Don’t come over. I have a hostage in my hands!"</p>
 <p>This sudden occurrence stunned the neighbors. The police rushed up with guns in their hands. The woman stepped back through the door and kept backing away. Several guns were trained tightly on her.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue attempted to persuade her, "Nguyen Hui, do you want to see your husband for the last time?"</p>
 <p>Nguyen Hui's face contorted and she gnashed her teeth, "You killed him!!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "We’re the police and we had no choice but to shoot in that kind of situation. Put the knife down and don't do anything stupid."</p>
 <p>"We just wanted to make some money! Why do you have to force me like this?!" With that, Nguyen Hui pushed the property manager away, turned the knife in her hand, and attempted to stab her own heart.</p>
 <p>With a bang, Nguyen Hui's body jolted once and the knife dropped. She covered the wound on her shoulder with her other hand.</p>
 <p>The police quickly rushed up and subdued her. Chen Shi turned to see&nbsp;Lin&nbsp;Dongxue's pistol smoking. She was panting, her face covered with cold sweat, and she said, "I was so afraid that I’d miss that shot!"</p>
 <p>"Good job! Good job!" Chen Shi praised.</p>
