 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "It's impossible for Chen Fengde to have met that little girl. She’s less than ten years old. A child’s looks change a lot. The soap sculpture shows what she looks like now, which he definitely shouldn't know."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "What you’re talking about is common sense. However, now that this thing has appeared in front of us, we should consider what connection exists between them... Of course, perhaps the soap carving isn’t of her, but of another person, such as her mother."</p>
 <p>"Miss Gu, has he mentioned the Dream Master to you?" Lin Dongxue asked.</p>
 <p>Gu You replied, "He mentioned it once. His tone was very respectful, as if he was talking about a God. He said that the Dream Master lives in other people’s dreams, but most people will wake up from dreams, which means that they constantly have to change 'places', so the Dream master often chooses to stay in the dreams of vegetative people because they can't wake up."</p>
 <p>"Why does it sound more like a biological habit?" Chen Shi commented. He saw Xin Bai holding a small notebook and asked him what he was noting down. Xin Bai replied, "Material!"</p>
 <p>After inspecting Chen Fengde’s daily items, the group of them left. As they passed through the prison compound, Lin Qiupu saw a prison guard carrying a tin bucket walking towards the factory. Some powder leaked from the bottom of the bucket. He noted this and stepped on the powder purposefully.</p>
 <p>After leaving the prison, Lin Qiupu took off his shoes and asked Lin Dongxue to bring over an evidence bag. He ran his finger on the powder on the sole and said, "No need. This is cement."</p>
 <p>"Why is there cement? There seems to be no place that needs to be repaired in the factory, right?" Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu shook his head.</p>
 <p>Back in the city, Xin Bai and Gu You went back to their homes respectively. The other three had lunch together. Lin Qiupu commented on today’s prison trip. “The prison must be hiding something. Of course, I’m not referring to a conspiracy theory. It must be the negligence regarding the prisoner’s escape, but this can’t be investigated thoroughly. The prison has always been isolated and behind closed doors, no one knows what happens inside.”</p>
 <p>"When it comes to isolation, Chen Fengde was the most isolated. He can dream no matter where he is, so there’s no need to escape from prison. I think someone coerced him to complete the unfinished mission from back then." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"Unfinished mission? That means he’ll kill more people?" Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>"Let’s check the connection between the deceased in the afternoon."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue and Chen Shi visited Lu Ming’s parents. After Lu Ming died, the loan sharks went to his parents to collect the debt. When they got to the door, they saw several debt collectors spraying paint on the door of the two elderly people who were hiding behind the door, trembling.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took the opportunity to teach the debt collectors a lesson and drove them away.</p>
 <p>They learned something from Lu Ming’s parents. Whether it was a valuable clue or not depended on whether it could be associated with the other clues. Chen Shi asked Xu Xiaodong to check with the hospital’s side of things. Could the information from ten years ago still be investigated? That was still unknown.</p>
 <p>It was getting late when they left Lu Ming’s parents’ house. Chen Shi said, “I’m going to pick up Tao Yueyue. I didn’t buy vegetables today. Can you help me buy some braised food from Huai’an Road?”</p>
 <p>"What's delicious about braised dishes? It's all spices. It's better to eat crayfish." Lin Dongxue's saliva came down when she thought of crayfish.</p>
 <p>"Those things are so unsanitary."</p>
 <p>"Having it on a rare occasion is no big deal."</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, take the key and go to my house, as well as cook the rice while you’re at it. Don't forget to plug in the power this time."</p>
 <p>"Go to hell!" Lin Dongxue raised her small fist.</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi took Tao Yueyue home, he saw Gu You and Lin Dongxue sitting in the living room talking, and there was a large bag of mala crayfish that Lin Dongxue had just bought on the table. Lin Dongxue's expression felt a bit off.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue noticed the atmosphere and whispered, "I’ll do my homework first."</p>
 <p>"I’ll call you out for dinner later."</p>
 <p>After Tao Yueyue entered her room, Gu You said to Chen Shi, "I told Officer Lin about that issue."</p>
 <p>"Which issue?"</p>
 <p>"The one we talked about this morning. Firstly, I don't need to keep it secret from Officer Lin. I believe her. The second is that this morning, Officer Lin saw me crying. I'm afraid she would misunderstand so it’s better to clarify it!"</p>
 <p>"You’re such a good person."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue's reaction was due to shock by what Gu You had told her. She said, "Miss Gu, I'm really sorry. I talked poorly about Chen Fengde in front of you."</p>
 <p>"No, no. I never call him father. I always called his name."</p>
 <p>"If we can catch him, would you like to see him?"</p>
 <p>Gu You was a bit sad. "If I can, of course that’s preferable, but you don't have to worry about my relationship with him. You can find me if you need help. I’ll tell you everything I know."</p>
 <p>Then, Gu You bid them farewell. Lin Dongxue sympathized with her and said, "She’s more unfortunate than me. My parents are only dead, but her father has become like this. Her heart must be very heavy!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was about to respond when he suddenly walked to the bedroom door and pulled at the door really hard. Tao Yueyue staggered out. Chen Shi said, "I knew you were eavesdropping, little thief!"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong with sister Gu? I'll go see her!" Tao Yueyue said.</p>
 <p>"Go ahead... By the way, a lot of crayfish was bought. You can take it and eat with her."</p>
 <p>As Tao Yueyue was leaving, she said to them, "I will be back on time at 9:00. I won’t come back early. You can eat the crayfish together slowly. Don't worry."</p>
 <p>"Okay, thank you for being so sensible. Come back at 9:30!"</p>
 <p>"Roger that!"</p>
 <p>When Lin Dongxue was sent home that night, Chen Shi browsed the Internet for a while before heading to bed. When he lay down, he was still looking back at the clues of the case.</p>
 <p>In his dream, he became Song Lang again, standing in a small broken room. The TV in the center of the room was broadcasting "The Ring" and strange music was streaming from the TV speakers.</p>
 <p>"Fuck!"</p>
 <p>He almost immediately realized that he was dreaming and wondered why it couldn’t change to something else.</p>
 <p>An ancient well appeared on the flickering TV and Sadako's head appeared. Chen Shi became nervous and thought,&nbsp;<em>Please don’t climb out!</em></p>
 <p>But dreams often have an unspoken rule. The more fearful of something happening, the more they will happen, so he hurriedly ran away.</p>
 <p>Pushing open the door, he actually came upon an interrogation room, but not the one from the Public Security Bureau. This was the interrogation room in the prison.</p>
 <p>Two prison guards were sitting at the table. One of them was holding a cigarette. The person sitting opposite them was Chen Fengde.</p>
 <p>Chen Fengde's gaze seemed to fall on Chen Shi, and he spoke to him, "...For you, dreams are just dreams, but for me, dreams and reality have long been integrated with each other. I can wake up from dreams and return to reality, but I can also wake up from reality and return to dreams. Just like this..."</p>
 <p>With that said, Chen Fengde disappeared, and the two prison guards were shocked as they searched all over the room. Chen Fengde's laughter echoed in the air. "I’ve woken up. Continue struggling in your dreams, mortals!"</p>
