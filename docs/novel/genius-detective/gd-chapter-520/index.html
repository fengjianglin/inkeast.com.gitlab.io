 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chapter 520: Fish’s Death And Broken Net<span id="footnote-ref-1d22"><a href="#footnote-1d22">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After careful identification of the car, Zhang Hao’s father’s DNA was not found in it. However, an investigation into its driving records revealed that the car had driven out of the city repeatedly two years ago. Chen Shi felt that it was the time when Zhang Hao abandoned the body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi speculated that Zhang Hao killed his father in the same way his father killed his grandfather. The meat was mixed with beef paste to be made into meatballs, and the bones were discarded in multiple places. A lone human bone appeared in the suburbs, even if dogs didn’t walk away with it, it was difficult for the finder to associate it with murder, so only one skull was found in the end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue aggregated all the evidence she had on hand and handed it to Lin Qiupu. He tried to apply for an arrest warrant. In the afternoon, an arrest warrant sent by the Procuratorate was handed over to Lin Dongxue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The formal arrest was at 7:00 in the evening. Lin Qiupu felt that the case involved eating human flesh, so the social impact wouldn’t be very good. If it was possible to keep it low profile, they should.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he got in the car, Chen Shi said, "Let me tell you some interesting news. A restaurant owner in a foreign country killed someone and treated the body in the same way. The customers called the police."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue asked, "Why? Was the taste not right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Because it was a vegetarian restaurant." Chen Shi laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What a heartless guy. How can you still laugh about it? You almost ate human flesh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arriving at the Zhangji Soup Noodle Store, it was very dark in the alley. Sounds of crying came from the building. Lin Dongxue stepped forward and knocked on the door. The wife came to open the door after a while and her eyes were red. The police entered the store without being polite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where’s Zhang Hao?" Lin Dongxue asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He went out shopping."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Sister, were you and your child crying just now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wife lowered her head and stayed silent. The child ran down the stairs. His face was red on one side and there were tears on his face. He said aloud, "Daddy is a bad guy. Please take him away!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What happened?" Lin Dongxue asked the wife.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He..." The wife stammered. "He was in a bad mood and hit the child. Can you not involve yourselves in other people's affairs all the time? I beg you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The child screamed, "Dad ran away. You guys should hurry and catch him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't talk nonsense!" The mother scolded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said sternly, "What the hell is going on? Absconding from a crime will increase the crime. You shouldn’t cover for him anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wife was so frightened that she cried with her face covered. She told them the truth. After the incident happened in the morning, Zhang Hao had a stomach full of rage and didn’t look too good. Later, he hit her son because of a trivial matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The son said he had told the police the truth and told him to wait for jail time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing this, Zhang Hao went out immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was shocked. Chen Shi glanced at the shelf and said, "A knife is missing... Not good. He may have gone to find his second uncle."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let's go find him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You stay. I’ll go with the others."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Be careful!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi took the other police officers and went straight to the second uncle's house. They entered the housing district and found a bunch of residents downstairs from a building. There was a lot of discussion there. They told the police that there seemed to be something wrong upstairs. People heard someone shouting. "Murder!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking up at a lighted room, blood was splashing on the curtains and there were silhouettes chasing each other inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without further ado, the police rushed up and kicked the door open. The room was in chaos. Zhang Kui was sitting on the ground covered with blood. He cried while stuffing his exposed intestines back into his belly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the police came, Zhang Kui burst into tears. "Help, my cousin is crazy!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they went to the bedroom, they saw Zhang Farong kneeling on the ground. He had already been stabbed several times. Zhang Hao grabbed his sparse hair with one hand and held a bloody knife in his other. His eyes were full of murderous intent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All the guns pointed at Zhang Hao. Chen Shi said, "Put the knife down!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhang Hao shouted, "Go ahead and shoot. I don't care! You ruined my life. I know I can't escape this disaster. Before I die, I will take this old hooligan’s life with me. I’ve endured him for a long time!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wake up. If you dare do anything, you’ll be killed immediately. You won’t even be able to see your wife and son for the last time. If this incident where you’ve harmed others while armed spreads, your son will be subjected to discrimination his entire life. He will have to live under a psychological shadow his whole life." Chen Shi knew that he couldn’t persuade Zhang Hao,who had accepted his doom, so he made him realize the costs of doing so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A little hesitation appeared within Zhang Hao's eyes. Zhang Farong struggled. Zhang Hao yanked his hair with force and shouted, "Don't move!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhang Farong screamed in pain and the police were on edge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why was it necessary for me to exist in a family like mine?" Zhang Hao said sadly. "Beating, insulting, and indifference are the ways in which fathers of every generation educate their children. If you put it in a nice way, filial sons are born under sticks<span id="footnote-ref-7880"><a href="#footnote-7880">[2]</a></span>. Such filial sons. My father killed my grandpa, I killed my dad, and my son betrayed me! There is only calculation and indifference between loved ones. Everyone’s relationship is as cold as ice. I hate him and I hate myself for the blood of the Zhang family that courses through my veins. I’ve lived my life without being able to get rid of the painful and helpless memories of being beaten by my father when I was a child!” He shook his head and shook his tears away. “I want to die! I want to die! I want to die! I don’t want to exist in such a world at all. It only brings pain to me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you know what I think of you? Although you are also a product of this sad family, you aren’t like your grandfather, your father, and your second uncle who cluelessly lived their days. You’ve introspected and tried to escape from it. You must want to be a good father and husband deep down. This opportunity hasn’t been completely lost. At least, don’t leave them with painful memories!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhang Hao cried and set his knife down and the police rushed in to arrest him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The injured Zhang Farong and his son were taken to the hospital. After Zhang Hao got into the police car, Chen Shi handed him a cigarette. Although Chen Shi rarely sympathized with the suspects, he still felt a tingle of pain when he faced him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Living and becoming the person you hate the most - This is the greatest sorrow in life!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said softly, "You can’t escape going to prison for these matters, but your wife and son can sell the house and live elsewhere."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My son will definitely be happy without me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"A family without a father cannot be happy. Even a father of domestic violence isn’t as bad. Of course, it would still be very difficult. Your son will be an adult in seven or eight years. I hope he will not become like you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can you do me a favor?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Tell me about it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I will confess everything. After this ends, I will divorce my wife and let her remarry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, I promise you."</span></p>
