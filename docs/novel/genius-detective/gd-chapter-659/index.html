 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chapter 659: Darkness Under The Light<span id="footnote-ref-589c"><a href="#footnote-589c">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Ms. Ding left, Chen Shi turned on Lu Qi’s computer to see if there were any other clues. There was no password set on the computer. There were some company documents on the desktop. Chen Shi opened them and glanced over them, but they were only some financial statements and internal notices.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hard drive was filled with nude photos of women and fitness videos downloaded from the Internet. This was Lu Qi’s personal hobby. There were no games, movies, or e-books on his computer. Chen Shi commented, "His life is quite simple."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "It’s also the first time I’ve seen a person like Lu Qi with a developed mind and simple limbs like an animal."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Being too simple can make you a bad person, which shows what human nature is really like."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After searching for a long time, they found a suspicious folder that was password-protected. Lu Qi posted a note on the computer with a string of letters on it. They opened the folder after a single try. This guy couldn’t even remember the password he set.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The document was full of photos. Lin Dongxue's attention was suddenly attracted. These were all bloody photos. There was a man in a suit that lay in a pool of blood. In another photo, there was another man in a suit whose face was already smashed into a pulp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the perspective of the photos, it looks like they were shot secretly, probably with a mobile phone. In a few photos, two plump pillar-like legs were also shown with blood on the pants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "These fat legs belong to Dong Xiao. Are these the evidence of Dong Xiao's crimes? Lu Qi usually follows Dong Xiao around, so when Dong Xiao kills people, he secretly photographed them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who are these dead people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This uniform looks like someone from a company..." After skimming over the photos, there seemed to be five or six deceased people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Dong Xiao killed his own staff casually when he’s in the company? That’s too much! I remember when we first went to find Dong Xiao to check the employees of the company. He gave us a list and there were no missing people on it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Dong Xiao asked someone to print that list. It’s obviously unreliable. These people who were killed by him have long been 'delisted' from the company's roster."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two brought the computer back since they couldn’t confirm the identities of the deceased. They could only bring in Secretary Jia who was in custody for another interrogation. Chen Shi showed him the photos one by one. Secretary Jia saw the first photo and said, "This is the bodyguard. He said something that he shouldn't have said, so President Dong... No, Dong Xiao stabbed him to death with a table knife."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What did he say that he shouldn’t have?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I remember that he made a joke. The premise was that Dong Xiao is fat."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What? Just because of this?" Lin Dongxue couldn't believe it. Was Dong Xiao a tyrant? He killed people casually just because of one sentence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Dong Xiao's temper is very explosive. We have to act carefully when we follow him around, for fear of saying something wrong and being killed by him. When he wants to kill someone, he will call them to him, smile, and tell you to help him fix his collar. Then, he’ll suddenly take out a knife and cut their throats. The Zhuoyuan company is regarded as Dong Xiao's small kingdom. The executives are all Dong Xiao's attendants. Once, an executive was in the smoking room playing games. Dong Xiao called him but he didn’t hear it. In anger, Dong Xiao grabbed a trophy and smashed him to death. Because of the death of this executive, we lost a few million yuan in business. The next day, Dong Xiao Xiao was very regretful and berated the people in the office as to why they didn't dissuade him. We were all frightened at the time and feared that we would become objects of his anger."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How did you develop this kind of company?" Lin Dongxue asked in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You must have checked that we’ve been using dirty means. As long as it can bring down the opponent, Dong Xiao will do anything he can. Have you ever seen a gun against the contractor's head, forcing them to sign a contract? Dong Xiao would do that. After that, he kidnapped the other person’s family members to prevent the contractor from calling the police. He colluded with the underworld. No, he himself was the underworld. He was thoroughly a criminal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’m guessing you were still willing to work for him for the money?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, when I was an executive at Zhuoyuan Company, my salary was very high. At the end of the year, Dong Xiao would gift you a house, a car, and a bonus. He was very generous. The most ridiculous one was when an executive took a liking to a third-tier star. After Dong Xiao learned of that, he brought the star over directly and asked her to accompany the executive for the night. However, Dong Xiao never gave away shares. All the shares in the company are held in his own hands. He had a 100% decision-making power. Regardless of everything, Dong Xiao was very good at winning over people’s hearts. He knew how to use people. He has never failed at taking employees from other companies, but it’s like he has a double personality. He is tyrannical like thunder and lightning when he’s angry, and he can beat someone to death over a little thing. We have to deal with the aftermath for him when it's over."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why didn't you say this before?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Secretary Jia lowered his head. "You didn't ask!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi felt as though he lost. "Is there anything else we didn't ask? Anything you didn't already say. Dong Xiao has fallen already and the police are investigating your company daily. Many people have already been arrested. You can take advantage of it now and make some merit!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, Secretary Jia talked about a bunch of dirty things that Dong Xiao had done. After talking all afternoon, Lin Dongxue's view of the world was enlightened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the photos caught Chen Shi's attention. He asked Secretary Jia, "Who is this person?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The face is already broken like that. I can't tell."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This photo was taken in December last year. Do you have an impression of this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Dong Xiao killed one person in December. It’s the Reporter Cao you guys mentioned."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is this man Cao Man?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Secretary Jia squinted his eyes to try and identify him. "He’s a reporter. It’s impossible to wear a company uniform... Ah, right, I said before that Cao Man didn’t have the right to interview. This is the truth. Dong Xiao doesn’t have the patience to meet such a small reporter. I also wondered how he met with Cao Man?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The last time you handled the body, what clothes did the body wear?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don’t know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why don't you know?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Secretary Jia sighed. "I really don’t know. Do you remember some random person’s clothes that you saw on the streets one day last month? I was very nervous when handling the corpse, and I can’t remember these details at all. However, they seemed to be black clothes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi immediately went to Peng Sijue and compared this photo with Cao Man's corpse. They found that the person in the photo was most probably Cao Man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this "Cao Man" clearly wore the company uniform, which raised suspicions. Chen Shi suddenly thought of an incident. The fact that the deceased was Cao Man was brought up by Chen Gong first. Cao Man's younger brother was also brought over by Chen Gong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the saying goes, there was darkness under the light. They hadn’t paid attention to Chen Gong who had been following them all the time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi immediately called the newspaper office where Chen Gong was located, but the one who answered the phone was a frolicsome female voice. She said that they weren’t a newspaper office, but a dance hall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi spent a lot of time investigating and found that Chen Gong's newspaper agency had already closed down. There was no such person as Chen Gong. However, the photo of Cao Man, an employee of the newspaper, looked exactly like Chen Gong.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It turns out that Chen Gong was Cao Man. He secretly arranged to guide the police to bring Dong Xiao down.</span></p>
