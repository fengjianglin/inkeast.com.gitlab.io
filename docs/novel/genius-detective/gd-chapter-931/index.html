<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>kk took a look at the sole of his shoe and asked blankly, "Is this blood? I don't know where I had stepped on it. Maybe on the way here!"</p>
 <p>"Maybe you have hemorrhoids on the soles of your feet." Sun Zhen took the opportunity to retaliate against him.</p>
 <p>"Fuck you."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi felt it necessary to check, so he asked kk to take off his shoes and send them to Peng Sijue’s lab. After a sample was taken, he took the shoes back. Chen Shi was too lazy to attend a celebration banquet. The three of them left and reminded them repeatedly before leaving that they will all be meeting in the hotel lobby tomorrow night.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi, "Captain, it's getting late, let's go home and sleep too!"</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Chen Shi was clearly startled. He was still thinking about the bloodstains from just now. "Let's go!"</p>
 <p>The next day, the sun was shining brightly through the window once again. Lin Dongxue, who had her long hair loose like draped ink, smiled and greeted him, "Good morning, husband."</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you call me ‘Captain’?" Chen Shi had already woken up a few seconds ago.</p>
 <p>"‘Husband’ sounds more intimate."</p>
 <p>"I had a dream that a man was killed in a sealed room. The doors and windows were definitely sealed tight. It was a perfectly sealed room with a ventilation fan. Guess how that person was killed?"</p>
 <p>"Suicide?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, in the classic sealed room trick, suicide is also a method, but this wasn’t it. The man had been stabbed to death from behind."</p>
 <p>"I don’t know."</p>
 <p>"The answer is: the murderer turned into ashes and was blown away."</p>
 <p>"Insane!" Lin Dongxue smiled and punched him. "That’s cheating, okay? I know why you had this dream. You’re thinking about the resurrection of the dead person."</p>
 <p>"Yes, is there such a possibility? The resurrected deceased person is the most convenient tool...Of course, the premise is that this thing can succeed."</p>
 <p>With a mind full of unsolved mysteries, Chen Shi got up to eat, dressed, and arrived at the bureau in the morning. He couldn't wait to find Peng Sijue. The forensics department said that he had been carrying out autopsies till late last night and was resting at home in the morning.</p>
 <p>The murderer's body had already been stitched up. Chen Shi glanced at the reports and asked, "Where is the blood sample I sent over last night?"</p>
 <p>"Oh, it hasn't been checked yet. We have a lot of things to check." A policeman said.</p>
 <p>"Prioritise that, I need to have the result by noon." Chen Shi picked up a stack of materials on the table and&nbsp;cadged&nbsp;a cup of coffee as well.</p>
 <p>The morning was still full of onerous desk work. Everyone was immersed in searching the list of the deceased who were born on February 19th, 1973. The whiteboard next to them was filled with a list of targets worth investigating.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi, "Captain, there’s a man surnamed Qin who died in 2000. He had been engaged in cult activities. Would you like me to note it down?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pondered, "What cult?"</p>
 <p>"A satanic cult that teaches that God is dead and Satan is about to rule mankind."</p>
 <p>"This doesn't seem to be from the same belief system. Was this Qin person the cult leader or just a follower..." Chen Shi suddenly thought of another person, who seemed to be called "Mr. Qin", but he couldn't remember it on the spot. He asked, “Is there anyone whose nickname is ‘Mr. Qin’?"</p>
 <p>"Tao Yueyue's statement?"</p>
 <p>"Correct!!!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi quickly stood up and ran to the office to look through the statement. The statement was twenty pages thick. Tao Yueyue had recounted every detail of the period when she was kidnapped using her extraordinary memory.</p>
 <p>He flipped through it quickly, and a certain page read:</p>
 <p>Tao: That dark fat chef asked me to cut the meat. When I was cutting the meat, I heard Mr. Qin&nbsp;say&nbsp;to Zhou Xiao, “Five people, four million. Do you want to consider it?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was very excited and said to Lin Dongxue behind him, "The clue has already appeared long ago but was overlooked by us. The hitman agent named Mr. Qin once wanted to give this job to Zhou Xiao, but he didn't accept it."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue questioned, "Were the five people mentioned by this dwarf the same five people in this case?"</p>
 <p>"This is the only serial murder case that Long’an has recently seen. Even if they weren’t, the killer this time was active in the underground world and he can be found through this intermediary."</p>
 <p>"We can give it a try."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi dialed kk’s number. kk’s side was very noisy. He asked, "Brother Chen, what's the matter? We’re buying props for tonight’s magic duel."</p>
 <p>"Do you know a man named Mr. Qin?"</p>
 <p>"Mr. Qin? There are so many people surnamed Qin. I don't know which one you’re talking about... Wait, the old immortal has something to say."</p>
 <p>Then the old man's voice came through the phone, "Hello?"</p>
 <p>"I’m listening."</p>
 <p>"I know a Mr. Qin who worked as an intelligence dealer in the underworld in his early years and now sells perfume."</p>
 <p>"Is he a dwarf?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!"</p>
 <p>"Where can I find him?!"</p>
 <p>The old man gave them an address and exhorted, "Don't ever say that I was&nbsp;the one who&nbsp;told you."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Call up a few people, tell them to change into plain clothes and bring guns... I'll call Yueyue over too to identify him in person."</p>
 <p>"Yueyue is still in military training, right?"</p>
 <p>"This matter is more important than military training. I’ll pick her up. You and the others will wait for me at this address."</p>
 <p>"I'll go with you."</p>
 <p>The two went to the police academy, picked up Tao Yueyue, and rushed to a large shopping mall. Other police officers were already waiting there. As a witness for identification, Yueyue naturally couldn’t meet the suspect. Chen Shi sat in the car and used his phone to give orders. "Bring him to the door."</p>
 <p>The police went in and walked out with a dwarf in a suit about five minutes later. It seemed that the dwarf had tried to escape. Tao Yueyue recognized him at a glance. "It's him!"</p>
 <p>"Yueyue, you stay in the car." Chen Shi instructed.</p>
 <p>He and Lin Dongxue got out of the car and walked closer. They heard the dwarf making excuses. "Dear officers, I just sell perfume. I haven’t offended anyone, right? Is it because I’m so handsome that I’ve enchanted some female leader who now wants me to be her husband?" As he said this, he rested his index finger and thumb against his chin.</p>
 <p>"You’re very eloquent." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"I’m a salesman after all, I’ve been trained through experience..." Mr. Qin smiled when he saw Lin Dongxue. "Beauty, do you want to buy perfume? You’re so beautiful that if you spray on my perfume as well you will be able to enchant everyone on the street."</p>
 <p>"What else do you do besides selling perfume?" Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>Mr. Qin spread out his hands. "I occasionally act as a relationship consultant for beautiful female customers."</p>
 <p>"Do you need me to say it directly? You’re a middle-man. A very special intermediary at that."</p>
 <p>"I don't know what you’re talking about!" Mr. Qin swallowed nervously.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was prepared and showed him a photo of the murderer who had been shot dead. Mr. Qin's pupils contracted and his Adam’s apple moved. He raised his head and looked at Chen Shi cautiously. Chen Shi said, "You introduced him to some business!"</p>
 <p>"I have the right to remain silent."</p>
 <p>"Sorry, but you don't have this right. Come with us!"</p>
