 <p>Lin Dongxue asked, “How did Zhou Xiao find Lao Hei so accurately? He was more efficient than us police.”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu explained, “Lao Hei's wanted order can be seen on the Internet, and the information regarding his identity is very detailed. Another thing is that he is gay and easy to find in the gay community.”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue added, “He wasn’t found in one go. In the past few days, several men have been killed in Long’an City. The method is very similar to Zhou Xiao’s. The only difference is that there was no branding of shame. It turned out that these men were all gay. “</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said emotionally, “No humanity!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu sighed. “The troublesome guy is back. It seems that the case must be filed for investigation. I'll go and tell the chief.”</p>
 <p>A few days later, Jiang Hui's body was found in the vegetable field behind Lao Hei's temporary residence. When she saw the little girl's body, Lin Dongxue couldn't help feeling sad.</p>
 <p>The story was published in the newspaper with the headline “Girl in the flower season bravely sacrificed herself to save her younger brother.” At the same time, the TV station also did an interview program. In the program, the big screen held Jiang Hui's best-looking photo with a pair of braids as she smiled brightly.</p>
 <p>The stepmother wiped her tears away while on the camera. “My family’s Hui Hui was a very obedient child and was usually very good to her brother. She always gave the best to her brother. Although I’m the stepmother, how can I not love such a child? I remember one time that our Hui Hui had a cold. She ran to the bathroom by herself and let me disinfect the house. She said that her grandparents were too old. In case they were infected, it would be terrible. Haii, she was such a kind and clever person. Why did God take her away?!”</p>
 <p>The father said, “Hui Hui was poor when she was a child, so she became independent early on. She often helped with housework and she was a child that you didn’t have to worry much about. Although I am always busy with my work, I usually come back to accompany her and Ming Ming whenever I have time. Hui Hui’s birthday is July 18th. Every year on this day, no matter how busy I am, I will always buy a birthday gift for her. After all, she left her biological mother when she was a child. I need to love her a lot. My palm and back of the hand are both flesh! She’s very talented and loved reading, so I bought her the four masterpieces when she was in elementary school. She often wrote articles for publication. When she got her pay, she even bought a massage chair for her grandfather. Look, this is what she wrote in her diary – “My Dad”, and I’m so sad to see these words. I hope that Hui Hui’s tragedy won’t happen to other families. Thank you to the police for catching the killer!”</p>
 <p>The teacher said, “Jiang Hui has always been an opinionated and responsible student. She has excellent grades in school. She didn’t have any learning problems that I had to worry over. She even often helped students with poor grades. Jiang Hui is recognized as a talented girl in our class. She has published many novels in magazines that describe campus life. They are lively, interesting, and exciting. I am also a fan of her work! At the class meeting, I often praised her for writing well so that everyone could learn from her. Her writing was often passed around among classmates.”</p>
 <p>The host asked, “Can Jiang Hui's novel be read out here?”</p>
 <p>The class teacher said a little awkwardly, “I didn’t bring them today, but I have an essay from school here that she won a prize for. I can read it to you… ‘Backbone. What is a backbone? The teacher said... ’”</p>
 <p>The teacher was interrupted halfway by the host. The host said, “Since Jiang Hui's younger brother was also a victim of this case, the show didn’t invite him here for the purpose of protecting minors. However, from the words of the parents and the teacher, we can see that Jiang Hui was an obedient, thoughtful, and opinionated girl with a lot of talent. Her unfortunate death is a deep regret for us...”</p>
 <p>At this point, the stepmother and father rubbed their eyes, and the teacher also took out a handkerchief.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue slammed the off button on the TV in the conference room. The other policemen were confused. Xu Xiaodong asked, “Why won’t you watch it?”</p>
 <p>“That's not Jiang Hui at all!” Lin Dongxue left angrily.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue's anger was only relieved when she saw a Weibo named “My sister is the coolest in the world.” The post was exactly the novel Jiang Hui didn’t finish writing. All the abuse she suffered from the stepmother and family caused a heated discussion for a while.</p>
 <p>However, within two days, the Weibo post and its account disappeared completely, and everyone's attention quickly shifted to other things.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue knew that the world would never know the truth through public discussion. Living people will lie for their own interests and face. Only the witnesses can remember the true nature of the girl.</p>
 <p>As long as one person in the world remembers her, she hasn't really disappeared.</p>
