 <p>Zhao Puyang was shaking with anger at the time. She really wanted to flatten the man's nose with a punch, but she restrained herself. She kept looking at the door. She knew that Teacher Yi was guarding her outside.</p>
 <p>Zheng Guohao asked wretchedly, "Would you like to take a bath to see if your body is dirty?"</p>
 <p>Zhao Puyang nodded.</p>
 <p>While Zheng Guohao went to the bathroom to heat the water up, she put the poison that they had prepared in advance into Zheng Guohao's alcohol and stirred it with her fingers to let it dissolve quickly.</p>
 <p>Zheng Guohao came back and touched Zhao Puyang's back. He said, "Uncle likes obedient girls like you. Obedient girls are popular everywhere they go. The water is hot now. Take off your clothes... Come on, uncle will help you!"</p>
 <p>Zheng Guohao held up Zhao Puyang’s hands. The situation made her very scared. She shivered and said, "I'll do it myself."</p>
 <p>"Okay, don't be afraid. Uncle is an adult!" Zheng Guohao picked the glass of alcohol up with a smile, took a sip, suddenly frowned, and began coughing. When he stood up, he stumbled and fell to the ground. He held his throat and as he felt an extremely painful sensation.</p>
 <p>Watching Zheng Guohao struggling on the ground, Zhao Puyang was so scared that she couldn't move an inch. Murder was such a terrifying thing.</p>
 <p>Zheng Guohao struggled to crawl to the sink, vomited, drank water, and then vomited again. It seemed like the symptoms of poisoning were beginning to ease.</p>
 <p>Aware of the bad situation, Zhao Puyang hurried to open the door and Yi Qing rushed in. Before Zheng Guohao had turned around to react, she quickly rushed over and stabbed him in the back.</p>
 <p>After killing him, Yi Qing commended Zhao Puyang for her bravery, then cleaned up the crime scene, took off her blood-stained jacket, and stuffed it into her bag... Yi Qing was dressed like a man that day, wearing a hat.</p>
 <p>After they went downstairs, they got into the car stolen by Yi Qing, but she didn't start the car immediately. Zhao Puyang asked, "Why aren’t we leaving?"</p>
 <p>Yi Qing smiled. "If we leave now, it’ll be filmed by the police and the police will find us."</p>
 <p>Zhao Puyang was very impressed and felt that Yi Qing was very smart.</p>
 <p>The two sat in the car all afternoon, during which Zheng Guohao's housekeeper found the body and called the police. A group of people gathered at the door. Zhao Puyang was afraid and hid in Yi Qing's arms, but Yi Qing seemed very calm.</p>
 <p>In the evening, the two left the community and went to another place. Yi Qing asked Zhao Puyang to stay in the car for a while. She changed her clothes, put on a wig, hid a knife on her body, took out a slingshot, and suddenly broke the surveillance monitor above them. Then, she calmly entered the community.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Yi Qing returned and smiled at Zhao Puyang. "It's done."</p>
 <p>After that, Zhao Puyang was very scared and kept asking if the police would come to find them. Yi Qing told her, "It doesn't matter if the police come or not, and even if they take you away, don't be afraid. You just have to say everything as I’ve told you. Teacher and the minor protection laws will protect you, all right?"</p>
 <p>Zhao Puyang believed that Yi Qing was her protector and she still believed her even now...</p>
 <p>Zhao Puyang suddenly said, "Even if it’s as you said and Teacher Yi used me, so what? I don't care. She was the only person who treated me well. When I grow up, I will kill all of you police who harmed her! I’ll kill all of you!"</p>
 <p>"Don't... Don't speak nonsense!" The lawyer interrupted her nervously.</p>
 <p>After Zhao Puyang was taken away, Lin Dongxue asked Chen Shi, "Has hatred been planted in this child?"</p>
 <p>"Perhaps. But after she grows up, she may understand everything. What’s important is not what she thinks right now. What’s important is to give her a warm environment to grow up healthily and with love."</p>
 <p>"You can’t really adopt another one, right?" Lin Dongxue smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>"It's enough having a small poisonous viper at home."</p>
 <p>Among the evidence brought back by the police, Peng Sijue found a small piece of Attorney Bai’s blood on a piece of burnt cloth.</p>
 <p>If Yi Qing had not sought her own death, this piece of evidence was probably enough to convict her.</p>
 <p>Going home that night, Chen Shi visited Gu You, who listened to the entire case. She said, "I didn’t expect that my words would actually play such a role."</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>Gu You told Chen Shi that she was trying to collect evidence by using a radical method that day. Chen Shi was surprised when he heard it and said, "This is not your ‘merit’. The emptiness after revenge is difficult to bear... Then again, you said you were going to kill Zhou Xiao. Did he take away any important people from you?"</p>
 <p>"I’ll tell you about this when I have the chance."</p>
 <p>"Will the psychological assistance for the orphanage continue? Honestly, I don't want Zhao Puyang to become the second Yi Qing. It’s best to find a good family for her."</p>
 <p>"I'll try my best to see if any of my clients would want to adopt her... Have you investigated that company?"</p>
 <p>"You mean the company that sponsors the welfare institution? A little bit. The young president of that company had a family tragedy before he took office. His brother, who should have become the president, died bizarrely. Of course, he was the prime suspect, but in the end, he was released because of insufficient evidence."</p>
 <p>"So, this company has a relationship with Yi Qing and 'Black Honey'. What are you going to do?"</p>
 <p>"It's very distressing!" Chen Shi habitually tried to reach for his cigarettes, but couldn’t. "If this company goes down, what will happen to the children in the welfare institution? Sometimes good and evil are really difficult to define. So, let’s not touch that company yet. Until the young CEO exposes his horse leg, we shouldn’t bother him."</p>
 <p>"Then, we can only investigate using other means..." Gu You held her chin and muttered, considering any other leads they had right now.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi wanted to smoke again. He wondered why he always wanted to smoke. It turned out that there was a faint smell of cigarettes in the room, which stimulated his addiction. It was exuding from Gu You.</p>
 <p>He said, "Miss Gu, forgive me!"</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi leaned over and sniffed her, he determined the source of the smell. Chen Shi asked, "I thought you didn’t smoke? Why does the smell of cigarettes on your body smell a bit like the type that Old Peng likes?"</p>
 <p>"Does it?"</p>
 <p>"Were you two together today?"</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "Who are you trying to lie to?"</p>
