<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Chen Shi asked, "In that case, can you use your network to help us find out who wishes to carry out this evil ritual?"</p>
 <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" The old man laughed dryly thrice. "Young people shouldn’t take a mile when people give an inch. I've already said enough. You are the police, so investigate it yourself! But “Five Elements Reincarnation” is fake. If some fool really cast this spell, the final result would only be that five people have been killed in vain... This old man takes his leave!"</p>
 <p>After he finished speaking, a puff of smoke rose from his sleeve and then he disappeared into thin air. A waiter in the restaurant was so frightened that he dropped his plates.</p>
 <p>However, kk quickly found out where the old man had gone and pointed to an aisle. "Look, that old tortoise is crawling on the ground!"</p>
 <p>They turned their heads and saw the old man crawling on the ground, slowly moving towards the door.</p>
 <p>"Once the magic trick is exposed, there is only embarrassment left." Sun Zhen commented.</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it’s too motherfucking embarrassing... Can he crawl faster?" kk asked.</p>
 <p>"Brother Chen, if someone is collecting organs, I can check it for you on the dark web. There are such trading platforms on certain sites." Sun Zhen offered.</p>
 <p>"Okay, thanks for your trouble!"</p>
 <p>"Fuck, he’s still crawling, just like a snail!" kk mocked.</p>
 <p>"Don't look. It's embarrassing. Let's pretend we didn’t see him!" Sun Zhen said.</p>
 <p>"What should we do?" Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi. "The only person who has the ability to do so refuses to help. Are we just going to watch Old Man Lu go bankrupt?"</p>
 <p>"Let’s go collect evidence and see if Liao Chunhuang is a 'rule-abiding scammer'. If so, wait until Old Man Lu is really deceived, and we’ll help Wang Haitao through legal means. If not, we’ll ask this old man to help and proceed according to our original plan..." Chen Shi glanced towards the aisle. The old man was still crawling slowly on the ground. He probably thought that Chen Shi and the others were astonished by the magical means of his sudden disappearance.</p>
 <p>"The biggest gain today is that we have found out information about the murders. According to this, the person behind the scenes wishes to ‘resurrect’ a certain deceased person who was born on February 19th, 1973'. Following this clue, it’s possible to find the murderer."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pondered, "In which year was Liao Chunhuang's wife, Xu Rongrong, born?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue hurriedly checked and said, "November 24th, 1975."</p>
 <p>"Well, it seems that there is no such coincidence."</p>
 <p>At this moment, someone arrived outside. Unexpectedly, it was Wang Haitao and he greeted them through the window. kk gestured. "That person is at the door!"</p>
 <p>"Why is he here?" Lin Dongxue said in surprise.</p>
 <p>"Hehe, I sent him a message. How will we know the result if we don’t fight a little for it? " kk smiled.</p>
 <p>The old man finally crawled to the door, but was blocked by a pair of legs in suit trousers. He waved his hands desperately, "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!"</p>
 <p>"Hello, are you Mr. Ju Zhenglei from the Heavenly Master Sect? I'm Wang Haitao."</p>
 <p>The old man only stood up then. He looked at Wang Haitao, and then at kk who was waving from his seat. "What are you doing? Bribing me? I told you that I won’t do it!"</p>
 <p>"Shall we sit down and talk?"</p>
 <p>"No, no, I'm leaving."</p>
 <p>"Waiter, get me a bottle of Wuliangye."</p>
 <p>The old man wiped his mouth. "Seeing that you are so sincere, I'll just sit down for a while!"</p>
 <p>The old man was brought back, and&nbsp;kk joked, "It’s a small world, I didn't expect that&nbsp;we'd&nbsp;meet again. Come over and sit&nbsp;here."</p>
 <p>"I'll just have a glass! Don't expect to persuade me."</p>
 <p>The waiter brought the wine and the glasses. Lin Dongxue took the initiative to pour the wine for him. The old man smiled, and picked it up to sniff it. He raised his head in&nbsp;ecstasy, then drank it slowly before taking a bite of the food. "Another glass! Come again! I haven’t thoroughly tasted it."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue poured another glass, and Chen Shi whispered to her, "Don't pour anymore."</p>
 <p>The old man finished his second glass with an intoxicated expression as if he was in an&nbsp;advertisement&nbsp;for Wuliangye. He smacked his lips, savoring the rich aftertaste, and put on airs, "Stop talking, it's really useless. I’ve always been someone who abides by the rules. I will never do something that doesn’t follow the industry rules."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao said, "Old sir, our family is really going to be done for. Please show your mercy."</p>
 <p>"This isn’t about me being merciful. Flies don't attack intact eggs. One hand alone can’t clap. If your father was more alert, he wouldn't have been fooled. Of course, you can rest assured that we abide by the rules. You won’t be completely bankrupt. In the end, you will definitely be left some money so that you won’t starve to death."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao smiled bitterly. "What if I ask you for help and pay a million as a reward?"</p>
 <p>The old man was slightly startled and wanted to take the wine bottle. Wang Haitao moved the wine bottle away and stared at him, waiting for a reply.</p>
 <p>"I’ll add a villa I own in Longwan."</p>
 <p>"It's useless even if you give me 100 million, I have said no..."</p>
 <p>"Then I will give you 100 million." Wang Haitao said calmly.</p>
 <p>The old man opened his mouth in shock, and everyone present, including Chen Shi, was very surprised. The price was simply terrifying.</p>
 <p>The old man suddenly&nbsp;became&nbsp;tearful and wiped his eyes with the tablecloth. "Mr. Wang, please don't increase the price. The more you increase the price, the more I can't stand it. Knowing there’s so much money that I can’t earn, my blood pressure is about to rise. This is really not a matter of money. The rules are more important than anything!"</p>
 <p>"Obviously, it’s to do a good deed. Why can't you go beyond the rules? Your rules, to put it bluntly, are the rules agreed upon between criminals!" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>The old man shed tears. "Yes, I’m a criminal. I have deceived many fire points in my life. Please handcuff me and get rid of me once and for all. I can't possibly help anyway.</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao also showed a disappointed expression. "It seems that my family is done for."</p>
 <p>"But…"</p>
 <p>The word "but" drew all eyes at the table to the old man's face. He said, "Seeing that Mr. Wang is in so much misery, I can go test the waters and see if the young fellow is keeping to the industry rules. I'm from a senior generation, so he has to respect me."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao immediately took out a checkbook, wrote down one million, and tore out the check for him. "Whether you decide to help or not, this money belongs to you. In addition, thank you for your help."</p>
 <p>The old man waved his hand. "I’ll try my best and the rest is up to the heavens."</p>
 <p>Hence, it was agreed that he would go over in the afternoon. This time, the old man didn't try the trick of disappearing into thin air. Maybe he was too excited, but his legs trembled. kk and Sun Zhen had to help support him on his way out.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Wang Haitao, "Do you have 100 million?"</p>
 <p>"I definitely don’t have 100 million in cash. I will take out a mortgage loan, borrow from friends, and think of ways to raise the money!" Wang Haitao smiled bitterly. "Our family is about to be done for. I have no choice but to try my best. I really hope my father won't be addicted to this stuff anymore. Ever since he stopped his treatment, his health is getting worse and worse, and he even drinks the talisman water given by the master every day. Haii! Apart from money, I have no other ability.</p>
 <p>"You still have friends." Chen Shi patted him on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Mr. Chen and Officer Lin. I’m really grateful that you are standing by my side in this situation."</p>
