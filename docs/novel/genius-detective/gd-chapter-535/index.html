 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An hour later, Chen Shi was sitting up on the bed holding a mobile phone and watching a video. Lin Dongxue leaned her head over. "What are you watching? Isn’t that the surveillance footage?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yeah, I want to see if there are any suspicious points."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I find that you’re a workaholic just like Captain Peng. Don't you feel tired?" Lin Dongxue asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Things I don't understand will cause me to feel uncomfortable."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, I won’t bother you then... Sleep! Sleep!" Lin Dongxue lay down wrapped in the blanket.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waking up the next morning, Lin Dongxue found that Chen Shi was still watching the surveillance video in that posture. She asked, "You didn’t watch that for the whole night, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I fell asleep in the middle of it and got up early... I had a dream. I dreamed that there was another possibility for this case. Lin Hui was the murderer."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue smiled. "Isn’t that too exaggerated?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, dreaming is also a way to integrate information. There are no realistic logical constraints in dreams and bold ideas often come up. Many scientists are inspired by dreams."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue changed her posture and looked at Chen Shi with her hand on her cheek. "According to your bold guess, what does the whole case look like?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi put down his mobile phone. "One of Lu Hao's and Zhang Rui's statements are different. Lu Hao said that those wigs and women's clothes were worn when he was depositing money. However, according to Zhang Rui, Lu Hao wore these clothes to pretend to be Lin Hui and draw him away."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue nodded. "Actually, I was a bit skeptical about this at the time. Lu Hao pretended to be Lin Hui and took the fake money to lead the people tracking her away. Lin Hui then took the real money to leave. This is the safest plan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Assuming that Zhang Rui's words were true, then Lu Hao was lying. At that time, Zhang Rui was successfully led away. Lin Hui took the real money away and an accident happened on the way out. That is, my appearance. I drove the exact same car as Zhang Rui. Lin Hui thought Zhang Rui was chasing after her so she left the car and money and pretended to disappear."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But is she willing to lose 10 million?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"One possibility is that she had already left a part of it for herself. She gave up on the large sum but left a small amount for herself. This small amount would still be a huge sum for an ordinary person. Another possibility is that her motive was not money at all. We always assumed that everyone was fighting for the ten million but ignored all other possibilities."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What other possibility?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Revenge!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lin Hui's revenge on her husband?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Think about it. If you were in her shoes, what would be your mood?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh..." Lin Dongxue looked at Chen Shi. "I loved you very much. If one day I found out you were gay, I might be extremely shocked! But would I kill you over it? I don’t think I could do it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Betrayal is not the whole of motivation, but it may be one of the catalysts. The increasingly intensified contradictions, the problem of property division, and her ruined youth."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, let's assume she has this motive!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Assuming she has this motive, the hair in the car was naturally prepared in advance. The purpose was to frame him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wait, she saw your car and thought that Zhang Rui was chasing after her. Does she still need to frame him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I said it was unplanned. According to her original script, there should be another method she would use to frame him. We won’t analyze this right now. From the perspective of Lin Hui when she went missing, she thought that Zhang Rui was the one who was following her. Therefore to her, it’s likely that the money was now in Zhang Rui’s hands. If she committed the murder during this time, it would solidify Zhang Rui’s motive in killing for wealth.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Killing two birds with one stone. She had her revenge on both people at the same time? What about the gun wielding man in gray?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That was self-produced and directed. She knew that Zhang Rui liked model guns and was engaged in a job creating auto parts. The police would think that Zhang Rui made a gun himself and used it to kill people. However, poison was found in Zhang Rui's apartment. This indicates that his original murder plan was to poison her, which is more subtle than shooting. Why did he give up the most insured plan and openly wound her with a gun in the housing district? That would be illogical.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue leaned against Chen Shi and pondered for a long time before saying, "It seems to make sense, but..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I know. Lin Hui hasn't been found yet, so everything isn’t tenable yet!" Chen Shi changed to a more comfortable position. "Right, I watched a video last night and found a truck staying at the gas station for a few minutes. If Lin Hui crawled into the truck, she could disappear perfectly from the security cameras."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi rewound it to that section and showed Lin Dongxue that the rear of the heavy truck was indeed a blind spot for the security cameras. The direction it was travelling towards was that of Lieyang.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s investigate!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then we’re not going home today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Change the ticket."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I really don’t know what to do with you!" Lin Dongxue smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong was surprised to hear that the two weren’t leaving again, but if Chen Shi didn’t solve the case thoroughly, he wouldn’t let it go. He could only follow along.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhang Rui was still undergoing rounds of interrogation today. The two went through the traffic control bureau’s surveillance footage to check the truck. From footage to footage, they saw a woman crawling out from behind the truck at a certain intersection in Lieyang and walking towards the sidewalk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the pictures were blurry, they could faintly discern that it was Lin Hui. From the movement of her walking, it seemed that she wasn’t injured at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue was very excited. "Old Chen, you guessed it right! She really disappeared in this way... Then, she’s now in Lieyang City."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Think who she would go to."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lu Hao?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It is possible, but not necessarily the case. She will probably remain ‘missing’ during this time."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But she must have a place to live and eat."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I think she would have prepared a hiding place in advance!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the afternoon, the two went to the local public security bureau to investigate Lin Hui’s ID card. However, Lin Hui had never used her ID card recently, and several bank cards under her name weren’t touched as well. She was really very cautious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A small detail was found during the investigation. Lin Hui's bank card had a large amount of money withdrawn shortly before her disappearance. The destination was unknown. She should have transferred the savings in advance for use when she went in hiding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "It seems that the only breakthrough point is Lu Hao."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "We don't have any evidence right now. This isn’t our home court. We don’t have the power to forcefully summon him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lu Hao can only be investigated in all directions."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Through the police in Lieyang City, the two of them carefully investigated Lu Hao and found that the kid was hiding his secrets deep. Nothing was exposed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, it was interesting to find that Lu Hao worked in a mechanical processing plant for two years before becoming a barber. Lu Hao was capable or had connections in making homemade pistols.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. The two have been staying in Lieyang for almost a week, and the case was in a stalled state. Lin Qiupu phoned them every day to urge them to return, as there were still a lot of things waiting for them to be done.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>On the afternoon of September 16</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Lin Dongxue sighed at the pile of materials on the table while holding her head. "It seems that this case can't progress on. Lin Hui will never show up now. As long as she’s in the ‘missing’ state, Zhang Rui will be greatly suspected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you going to stay in Lieyang forever?" A voice came and the two turned around. They said in shock, "Captain Peng?"</span></p>
