<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>An unplanned situation had occurred in the middle of the "performance". Liao Chunhuang was also flabbergasted for half a minute, then he stammered, "Brazen Demon Lord, stop being arrogant. You have to do what I tell you to do."</p>
 <p>The torn sock floating in midair said, "Sorry, I don't have the power right now. I have to eat my fill of mooncakes before I can help you."</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu said, "Master, it’s the Mid-Autumn Festival. If the Demon Lord wants to eat moon cakes, I’ll just go and get some."</p>
 <p>"Then... go get one!" Liao Chunhuang said in a cold sweat.</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu asked Wang Haitao to get some. Taking this opportunity, Liao Chunhuang desperately gestured to a disciple, only to see that disciple quietly withdraw. In fact, there was a secret chamber hidden at the side of this room, and Sun Zhen was hiding in it right now.</p>
 <p>kk said, "Oh no, they found out. I'll help out!"</p>
 <p>With that, he slipped out quietly.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a cloud of smoke rose up in the room and everyone was shocked. Chen Shi noticed a figure crawling out from under the cloth-covered altar table and standing within the smoke. After the smoke dissipated, he laughed, "This Taoist master saw that there are demons causing chaos here, so I’m using my skills to help."</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu said in surprise, "Hey, isn't this the old immortal from yesterday?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, he’s Master Zhenglei from the Heavenly Master Sect!"</p>
 <p>"Thank you for the recognition!" The old Taoist priest cupped his hands together in greeting. "I greet the immeasurable Master&nbsp;Chunhuang!"</p>
 <p>The two swindlers were flattering each other, but Liao Chunhuang’s hands were trembling underneath. He wasn’t afraid, but angry. It was the most shameless thing for a peer to cut the ground from under the feet of someone from the same industry.</p>
 <p>The old Taoist priest pinched his fingers in calculation, and then said in fear, "The immeasurable Master&nbsp;Chunhuang, you’re actually summoning the Demon Lord here? This is an act against the heavens!"</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu said, "Master, I was the one who asked him to summon the Demon Lord. I want to live a few more years. Don't blame him."</p>
 <p>"Old gentleman, there are many ways to prolong life. This Demon Lord must never be summoned. The Demon Lord's nature is malevolent. Even if he assists you, he would only take away more things from you."</p>
 <p>"As long as I live a long life, I don't care what the price is."</p>
 <p>"Your words aren’t right. Extending your life regardless of the cost will only make you miserable. After you die, you will also suffer endless torture in hell. I have a close relationship with The Old Man of The South Pole.<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-935#footnote-c688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> I can discuss with him to give you 12 years of life in exchange for 12 in your next life. There is no cost to this. Hurry up and dismiss this Demon Lord!"</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu was startled, and asked Liao Chunhuang, "Master, there’s also this method?"</p>
 <p>With cold&nbsp;sweat on his forehead, Liao said, "We asked the three deities, Fortune, Prosperity and Longevity, a long time ago, and they were unwilling to help, so we came up with this inferior plan."</p>
 <p>"That's because of your shallow level of cultivation. The deities aren’t heeding your calls, but it will be different if I invite them."</p>
 <p>"Huh, my cultivation level is shallow? Don't deceive the mortals here. I have a history of 1400 years, so even though I have a century-old body, I still look youthful. Unlike you whose golden core is impure, so you have the appearance of an old man. Old Master Lu, his cultivation is far below mine. Don't be bewitched by his heresy!"</p>
 <p>"Haha!" The old Taoist priest threw his head back and laughed. "The ignorant junior is actually uttering wild words here. I have undergone nine reincarnations, and have been cultivating my skills for a total of 580 million years. Half of the immortals in the heavens are my juniors. It’s only that you don’t recognize my golden body."</p>
 <p>"Then show off your skills!"</p>
 <p>"I’ll let you see what a real immortal’s skills are like. Haa!"</p>
 <p>The old Taoist priest stretched out his hand and pushed forward. They could see the torn sock float up and twist in midair.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, cheap tricks!" Liao Chunhuang said with disdain. He stretched out his hand and pushed, and the torn sock flew in the opposite direction.</p>
 <p>The two of them each exercised their powers and pushed the torn sock around. Old Man Lu was astonished by what he saw. In fact, kk, Sun Zhen and Liao Chunhuang's disciples were huddled together in the secret chamber next to them, competing for control of the mechanism behind it.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue didn't stay to appreciate this scene. They slipped out through the back door during the chaos.</p>
 <p>While the two great immortals were fighting each other, they went to the room which Liao Chunhuang normally used to meditate and rest. They took out the luminol reagent, sprayed it on the ground, but didn’t find any blood.</p>
 <p>Then they went to the next room, but still didn’t find any traces. Lin Dongxue asked, "Could it be a secret room or something like that?"</p>
 <p>"No, it wouldn't. At the time, kk had just come for a tour with the old Taoist priest. It must be one of these rooms... It stands to reason that the bloodstains on the ground would definitely congeal. How could he step on the bloodstains?"</p>
 <p>"It’s the same as how we use damp cotton swabs to take blood samples, the soles of kk's shoes must have been damp at the time."</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Chen Shi said ebulliently. "He probably had gone to the bathroom or someplace like that. Let’s go and search."</p>
 <p>There was a bathroom at the end of the corridor. Diagonally opposite was the room consecrated to Zhou Xiao's altar tablet. The two sprayed reagents on the floor. When they sprayed around the prayer mats, some fluorescent blue appeared on the ground. The two were excited and immediately used cotton swabs to extract some samples.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi suddenly raised his hands and put them on the wall. Lin Dongxue asked what was wrong. He said, "There’s a breeze!"</p>
 <p>The room was originally made of reinforced concrete. In order to create the rustic atmosphere of a Taoist temple, wooden wall panels had been pasted on the walls. Chen Shi knocked on one of the panels and found that there was a hollow sound.</p>
 <p>He kicked with his foot a few times. The wooden board cracked from the kicks. After breaking it apart, there was a secret door hidden behind.</p>
 <p>The two of them exchanged glances of astonishment, and squeezed in sideways. They saw a very large space with a concrete platform in the middle. There seemed to be some people standing around, looking very eerie in the dead silence and the darkness.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue found the light pull cord on the wall and pulled it. The secret room was instantly illuminated. It turned out that there were five cast copper Taoist boys standing around the concrete platform with their hands stretched out. The round platform had been painted with a bagua and yin and yang symbols.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue sprayed some reagents on top of it, but there were no reactions this time. It seemed that the ceremony had not yet begun. Chen Shi discovered a small freezer at the side of the entrance. A small freezer standing alone in the empty secret room really stood out.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi opened the freezer and saw that there were several bags inside, which had already frozen. There were clearly five human organs in the bags.</p>
 <p>"The evidence is conclusive. Liao Chunhuang really is..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi turned his head and found the Taoist “boy” named Qingfeng standing silently behind him. Before he could react, Qingfeng pulled him up and threw him backwards. Chen Shi almost flew over half the room and fell heavily to the ground.</p>
 <p>"Asshole!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue cursed, punching Qingfeng in the face, but the latter party remained unmoved, and reached out to grab her.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue grabbed his wrist with her left hand, and pushed his shoulder with her right hand. This was a technique used for capturing the enemy's fist, but Qingfeng's arm was thicker than her leg, and she found that she couldn't move the other party's joints at all.</p>
 <p>Qingfeng grabbed her neck and lifted her up like a baby chick. The pain of suffocation caused Lin Dongxue to struggle violently.</p>
 <p>Seeing this situation, Chen Shi rushed over and threw himself on Qingfeng's body, strangling his neck with his arms while using all his strength. Only then did Qingfeng release Lin Dongxue, and he grabbed at Chen Shi backhandedly while moving backwards.</p>
 <p>There was a huge disparity between the two’s body sizes. Chen Shi locked on his throat tightly, trying to make him fall unconscious. Qingfeng's head began to turn red and purple, and the movements of his hands became frenetic. Chen Shi's jacket was almost torn apart. However, he didn’t let go no matter what.</p>
 <p>Seeing that he was about to succeed, a huge force suddenly pulled Chen Shi away. It turned out that the Taoist “boy” named Mingyue had also appeared. He had pulled Chen Shi away. Chen Shi didn’t want to be sent flying again, so he took off his jacket and went past between Mingyue's legs.</p>
 <p>Mingyue turned around to beat Chen Shi. Chen Shi knew that he wouldn’t win in a full-on fight. He went around to the side and punched him on the waist.</p>
 <p>When Mingyue turned around angrily, he went around again and kicked the back of Mingyue's knee.</p>
 <p>"Ah!"</p>
 <p>Mingyue roared, and as soon as he turned around, Chen Shi, who was more nimble than him, punched his nose, causing blood to spurt from his nostrils.</p>
 <p>Qingfeng was about to head over to help, when he suddenly heard Lin Dongxue yell, "Nobody move!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue took out her pistol. Even immortals could hardly escape a gun. Qingfeng was a little scared and prepared to surrender when the black hole of the pistol’s muzzle pointed at him. Mingyue had more spine than him, and shouted, "Don't be afraid, the police dare not shoot."</p>
 <p>"Then you can try it!" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>Mingyue gritted his teeth, but he still didn't dare to take this kind of gamble.</p>
 <p>"Everybody kneel down!"</p>
 <p>"A man only kneels to the heavens, the earth, his parents..."</p>
 <p>"Kneel down!!!"</p>
 <p>The two could only raise their hands and kneel down. Chen Shi caught the handcuffs thrown over by Lin Dongxue, handcuffed the two people’s wrists together, and asked, "Who asked you to come?"</p>
 <p>"Master... he found that you guys went missing halfway, so he asked us to come and have a look. As expected, you guys had malicious intentions."</p>
