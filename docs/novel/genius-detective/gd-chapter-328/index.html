 <p>On the way there, Lin Dongxue asked Fan’s mother, "Why do you think that they will be there? Is there anything special about that place?"</p>
 <p>"It's actually... That place was where the child’s dad had committed suicide."</p>
 <p>Fan’s mother said that Fan Lixue, Han Jingming and many other students lived together in the same community as children. Later, the old houses were demolished, and the new apartment buildings there were built. However, due to funding problems, the project suddenly stopped, and a lot of people ended up homeless.</p>
 <p>At the time, the demolition of the old houses was assigned to Fan Lixue’s father, who went door to door to notify the residents. Everyone became homeless, so he became the target of criticism. Someone started rumors that he had received the developer's bribes. In fact, Fan’s father was just a low-level civil servant. Even if he had wanted to, he wouldn’t have had the power to do so.</p>
 <p>During that period, the neighbors came to their house every day to cause trouble, and their family had no peace. The anger of the adults was transmitted to the children, and they began to bully Fan Lixue at school. One day, her father drowned and died on the way home. Although Fan Lixue’s mother suspected that he had been pushed down, the police couldn’t find any evidence of homicide. Fan’s mother could only declare to everyone that Fan's father could not bear the pressure and committed suicide.</p>
 <p>After Fan’s father passed away, the mother and daughter only had each other. She knew that there was always someone bullying Fan Lixue at school, but Fan Lixue was afraid of her mother worrying and wouldn’t say anything when she returned home. The mother felt pain in her heart when she saw this, but she was powerless.</p>
 <p>After saying that, Fan’s mother wiped her sad tears away and Lin Dongxue comforted her a little.</p>
 <p>The three arrived at the buildings at night when it was gloomy and eerie. After looking around for a while, Fan’s mother suddenly faced a certain direction and shouted her daughter’s name. Lin Dongxue looked up. There were two figures on the edge of the top floor who looked like they were going to tumble down from that dangerous place at any given moment.</p>
 <p>Fan’s mother shouted her name again and climbed up the stairs in the dark, falling down many times along the way. Lin Dongxue and Xu Xiaodong followed closely behind. There were sixteen floors in the building. There were no railings on either side of the stairs, so they would have fallen down with one misstep. When they had finally climbed up to the top floor, Lin Dongxue was panting as if her lungs were about to explode.</p>
 <p>"Fan Lixue, mother is here. Don't do anything stupid!" Fan’s mother shouted.</p>
 <p>"Mother, don't come over!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue looked up and saw Fan Lixue standing on the edge of the building. There was a girl standing motionless beside her like a statue. It was Han Jingming who had been bullying her all the while. Fan Lixue grasped the mobile phone in her hand. If she plays "Cloudy Day" again, Han Jingming will take a fatal step forward.</p>
 <p>"Don't come over!" Fan Lixue raised her mobile phone, as if it was a dangerous nuclear bomb detonator. "One step forward, and I will let her jump off the building!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Ji Changxin has already been arrested, and no one can help you. If you kill her, you will go to jail, maybe for 20 years. Maybe 30 or 40 years. Is it worth it?”</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue cried, "Why do I have to bear it if they bully me?! The teacher would only say that “Flies don't crowd around uncracked eggs.” and “Why would they only beat you, but not others?” I only heard these illogical words thrown at me. My mother also advised me to endure it, saying that this is our fate. I went to school every day, and it was as painful as jumping into a vat of boiling oil. Whenever the bell after school rang, I was terrified. The more I cried, the more my bullies laughed. Why?! How can they do that? It was only until Uncle Ji appeared that I could see light in my life. It turns out that I can avenge myself too! I’m not afraid of going to jail or getting the death penalty. I want to let these bad people know that I’m not easy to mess with.”</p>
 <p>"Don't do this, please..." Fan’s mother cried and fell to her knees.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue continued to persuade, "Have you ever wondered how hard it would be for your mother if you go to jail? Think about her being outside alone, enduring the bullying and insults of others, and spending decades alone. She may never be able to see you again! Don't let your mother pay for all of this. It's too cruel to her! "</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue bit her lip. Noticing that she was wavering, Lin Dongxue slowly approached her, and Xu Xiaodong did the same, ready to drag the two down together.</p>
 <p>When they were about ten steps away, Fan Lixue suddenly became alert, "Don't come any closer!" She put a hand on Han Jingming's shoulder. "I'll push her down if you come any closer. You police only know how to spout nice words. You haven’t experienced this!”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong said, "Little Fan, in fact, like you, I was bullied by the class bully when I was in school. I also had the impulse to retaliate against them, but you cannot solve the problem with violence. Life is not fair, but you can only become stronger if you don’t want to be bullied. That’s why I became a police officer."</p>
 <p>"Come on, be a good girl and take your hand off her shoulder." Lin Dongxue advised.</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue burst into tears, and at that moment, Han Jingming suddenly woke up. She screamed, "Why am I here?!" Then she lost her balance.</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue, who had her hand on her shoulder, lost her balance at the same time. In order to pull her body back, Han Jingming pushed Fan Lixue subconsciously, and Fan Lixue immediately fell off the edge.</p>
 <p>"No!" Fan’s mother screamed.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue pounced, but it was too late. In the moonlight, she saw that Fan Lixue had fallen to the ground. Her body was twisted and her eyes were wide. Blood flowed from her mouth.</p>
 <p>"She fell down by herself! She fell down by herself!" Han Jingming was frightened and desperately tried to emphasize her innocence. "I don't even know how I got here!"</p>
 <p>"Return my daughter to me!" Fan’s mother Fan screamed and rushed forward, trying to push Han Jingming down. Xu Xiaodong stopped her in time and Lin Dongxue quickly pulled Han Jingming aside.</p>
 <p>Walking down the building, Lin Dongxue felt as if she was stepping on cotton. Fan Lixue had stopped breathing and her mother rushed to her body and wept. Lin Dongxue took out her phone which had been ringing and said weakly to Lin Qiupu, "Han Jingming is okay... Fan Lixue is dead. "</p>
 <p>"What?!"</p>
 <p>"It was an accident..." Lin Dongxue said in a voice choked with emotion.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu told Ji Changxin, who was still in the interrogation room, and said, "Using violence to curb violence will only lead to tragedy!"</p>
 <p>"If I had known..." Ji Changxin cradled his head in pain.</p>
 <p>Soon after, Ji Changxin was handed over to wait for the judicial proceedings. Although he had used hypnosis to mislead the victims into commit suicide, considering his subjective motive, the homicide charge could not be escaped.</p>
 <p>Before being taken away, his only wish was to talk to his daughter just once, but after the police phoned his family, both his ex-wife and his daughter refused to speak to him. At that moment, Ji Changxin's expression was as though his soul had died.</p>
 <p>Not long after Han Jingming returned to school, she transferred to a new school where no one knew her. When Lin Dongxue went to look for her to review the case, she unexpectedly found out that Han Jingming was being bullied in the new school.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the news of her pushing her classmate down from a building had spread like wildfire. The classmates there regarded her as a walking calamity. They initially alienated her and acted indifferent towards her, but she started getting humiliated verbally. Finally, it developed into full-fledged bullying. Lin Dongxue saw wounds on Han Jingming's face and Han’s eyes were full of dread. Lin Dongxue had mixed feelings. If a person is regarded as abnormal, they will soon be ostracized. School campus bullying worked that way.</p>
 <p>Before the trial began, Ji Changxin died in the detention center. Fellow inmates said that he had been talking to the wall all day, as if he was crazy.</p>
 <p>Early in the morning the next day, Ji Changxin died peacefully. He was not poisoned but developed the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. He had no injuries on his body and his organs were in good condition. He had a button in his mouth. After careful investigation and analysis, they concluded that he had performed a perfect self-hypnosis on himself and convinced himself that the button was poison. In that way, he really was "poisoned and died".</p>
 <p>That was the last and most perfect hypnosis murder in his short criminal career.</p>
