 <p>Chen Shi pulled out his cell phone and dialled Peng Sijue's number. Peng Sijue had stayed up all night yesterday and was still asleep. He was awakened by the phone and got out of bed. "What?! What!!"</p>
 <p>"We’ve made a breakthrough. Do you want to hear about it?”</p>
 <p>"No!"</p>
 <p>"Then let's talk when we meet up. By the way, do you know anyone in the CDC? We want to infiltrate a dog farm in the suburbs to investigate. We need to hurry!”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue hung up the phone without saying a word and Chen Shi smiled. "It seems like he’s thinking of a way. Let’s wait for his news!”</p>
 <p>"You have too much confidence!" Lin Dongxue sneered, "What next?"</p>
 <p>"After a busy day, I need to head back to rest for a while. Tao Yueyue should have gotten off school by now." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"Then, I’ll return to the bureau and see if I can persuade my brother to formally file a case!" Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue returned to the bureau and informed Lin Qiupu of the current progress. Lin Qiupu shook his head. "You have only found out that this person is related to over 30 cases of disappearances. It can’t be proved that it’s a felony.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was agitated. "All the missing people were acquainted with him, and the disappearance of these people all removed obstacles for his career development. Is it still impossible to conclude that this person is suspected of killing? Moreover, there is the testimony from the young monk."</p>
 <p>"Officer Lin, you shouldn’t be so opinionated like this. If the police don’t follow the law, then who will maintain social order? Let me give you an example. There was a case in the United States where the murderer and the victim quarrelled, and the murderer killed the victim in front of the tavern by crushing him with a car. Then, they cleaned up everything. You would think that the witnesses were sufficient evidence, right? But the police couldn’t convict him. In the end, the car was dismantled and they found a blood stain the size of a nail before they convicted him. If there’s no evidence, even if you see it with your own eyes, it won’t pass. You can catch him, but at the courts, the judge will acquit the suspect. What’s the point in that?”</p>
 <p>"Brother!" Lin Dongxue begged.</p>
 <p>"Okay, I'll give you another two days. No, five days, okay?!"</p>
 <p>"I want a few more people as well."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu looked miserable. "I'm also investigating a case here. Fine, I’ll give you two more!”</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue left happily and Lin Qiupu looked at her back and smiled.</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi arrived home, he received a call from Peng Sijue. Peng Sijue said, "I contacted a friend from the CDC. In two days, he will arrange a random hygiene check. What are you going to do? Prepare for it by yourself."</p>
 <p>"In two days? Can it be tomorrow?"</p>
 <p>"I just confirmed..."</p>
 <p>"It's better to do it tomorrow," he argued. He could hear Peng Sijue's sigh from across the phone. Chen Shi said, "It doesn't matter if we do the hygiene check or not. We mainly need to find the evidence that proves the owner was the murderer. Can we borrow the clothing and documents of the CDC and go ourselves?"</p>
 <p>"It's against the rules."</p>
 <p>"Why are there so many rules in your head? We’ll do it just like that. We'll see you tomorrow morning."</p>
 <p>"It’s been unfortunate knowing you!"</p>
 <p>The next morning, Chen Shi went to the bureau and found a CDC car parked at the door.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue had pleaded to his classmates from the CDC without face to borrow the clothing and documents. There were five sets in total. Chen Shi asked, "Did you test the evidence that you found yesterday?"</p>
 <p>"I find that you’re becoming more and more rude. When we first met, you brought me breakfast. At least you still faked being polite. Now it’s like you’re my boss and you’re driving me like a slave. Do I owe you or something?” Peng Sijue said defiantly.</p>
 <p>"Oh, if you didn’t say that, I would have forgotten. I put the breakfast in the car. Wait for me here and I’ll go get it.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi left for a while and came back, greeting everyone in the forensics department with a large package of breakfast. Everyone happily went over. Peng Sijue touched the soy milk and found it was still hot. He said disdainfully, "Did you just buy it?"</p>
 <p>"Didn’t you say I was being fake anyway? It’s okay if you understand it in your heart. Why bring it out into the open?” Chen Shi smiled shamelessly.</p>
 <p>"Humph!" Peng Sijue threw the report to Chen Shi. "Look at it yourself."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi glanced at it. "Is this Chen Guang's DNA?"</p>
 <p>"It's a human organism, but it's not related to the young monk."</p>
 <p>"It doesn't matter. Maybe someone else was killed in that room!"</p>
 <p>"I have a question. The windows in that room are so high!" Peng Sijue gestured to a height with his hand. "As described by the young monk, the blood splashed the window red at the time, making the lights outside change in color when viewed from the inside. However, a single person doesn’t have that much blood in them.”</p>
 <p>"That’s true..." Chen Shi muttered. "Let’s ignore this for now. As long as we find the evidence today, that's enough!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi’s breakfast wasn’t for nothing. When everyone finished eating, he said, “I don’t know how to take evidence samples. It’s a waste if I take up one of these outfits. I think it’s best if Captain Peng went in with four people from your team!”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue said coldly, "I think so too."</p>
 <p>He immediately took four men and put on the white coats used by the CDC. The police evidence testing kit was too conspicuous, so they bought several plastic boxes from a nearby supermarket and hid the kits inside.</p>
 <p>Once prepared, the five of them drove away in the CDC car. Chen Shi drove his own car carrying Lin Dongxue and stayed far behind. Today, Xu Xiaodong had a separate task where he had to investigate Liu Hong's interpersonal relationships.</p>
 <p>Of course, they couldn’t investigate too openly, as they didn’t want to alert him.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi parked his car by the bushes not far from the dog farm and started playing on his mobile phone. He installed a new app and after a while, an image finally popped out. Lin Dongxue curiously leaned over to take a look. "What is this?"</p>
 <p>"Old Peng has a miniature camera on him. This video is a live feed of what he can see."</p>
 <p>On Peng Sijue’s side of things, everyone went inside and showed the CDC document saying that they were there to conduct a hygiene and sanitation check. The staff members said that they would need to contact the boss. Peng Sijue said, "You can call him while we go ahead and check.”</p>
 <p>The staff member said, "No. The boss said that if an outsider comes in, he must be notified."</p>
 <p>"Huh!" Peng Sijue sneered, "That's okay. You can tell him that we’re leaving and he can just come to our department and pay the fine next month.”</p>
 <p>"Don't!" The staff member stopped Peng Sijue and started stalling for time using sweet-talk. At the same time, they were calling Liu Hong. After requesting information, the staff member informed them, “The boss has said that you can conduct the check now.”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue began to pretend to check the sanitation, drinking water, and vaccination credentials of dogs in the farm. Peng Sijue looked at the vaccination records slowly, asked where they were vaccinated, and called to verify this.</p>
 <p>Taking this opportunity, his men began searching for traces of blood in the kennels.</p>
 <p>After half an hour, the group came out and the staff politely saw them off. When they returned to the car, Chen Shi couldn’t wait to call him. "How did it go?"</p>
 <p>"It would be strange if we could find anything since it’s been so long!”</p>
 <p>"It's okay, just treat it as a process of elimination. I’ll treat everyone to a meal at noon.”</p>
 <p>"This meal isn’t free either, is it?"</p>
 <p>"I want to look around the dog farm and investigate!"</p>
