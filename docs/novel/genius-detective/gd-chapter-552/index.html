 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ten minutes later, Liu Qin sat in the office, holding a cup in his hands and shaking so hard that the water in the cup had all spilled out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi sat down in front of him and asked, "Do you smoke?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin took a cigarette as he trembled and lit it. Lin Dongxue said, "The higher-ups don’t agree to the protective detention, but if you’re really afraid, you can stay here without any restrictions on your freedom."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"How do you know that you’ll be next?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Her signature. Please take a look. Her QQ signature."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue took out their phones and added Ah Zhen’s QQ number, and saw that the signature read, "Lonely suffering, lovesick bones, withered flowers, one, two, three..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The previous signature was something like "Flickering Flame". Last night, I logged in to QQ thinking of leaving a message to bid her farewell. Suddenly, I found that her signature had changed. No one knew her QQ password. This must be a murder advance notice. I will definitely be the second one! Absolutely!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi said, "Although I don't agree with it being a murder advance notice, I have to correct you a little. You’d be the third!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who was the second one? Ai Guowei?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Sun Jun. He’s already dead."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Sun Jun?" Liu Qin thought for a while, "Sun Jun from the other department? Surely, it isn’t him. Why is it him? He didn’t do much to Ah Zhen!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who was the person that you just mentioned?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Ah Zhen's brother."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Did he treat Ah Zhen badly?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Actually, he treated Ah Zhen very well. So well that he went overboard. As it was a single-parent family, the elder brother was the only male in the family. In addition, he had gone out to work early and had more authority at home. When she was in high school, she was discovered to have depressive tendencies. She was sent to an unregulated institution for treatment by her brother. Instead of being cured, it made Ah Zhen even more sensitive and vulnerable. However, she no longer dared to tell her loved ones that she wanted to die. She could only keep it in her heart." Liu Qin grabbed at his hair. "I should have noticed that she wanted to talk to me that day. You don't know about this, but she used to vent to me frequently before. Working for the past two years has hardened my heart. I’m also not as sensitive as I was before. I thought that she would have gotten more mature. Now I understand that she had never grown up! I killed her!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin pounded his own head. Lin Dongxue grasped his wrist. "Don't blame yourself. This is no longer a simple suicide, but murder. We still need your help."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin wiped away his tears and drank some water.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue asked, "I want to ask you something. Do you know what Gu Daqiang and Sun Jun were fighting about?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I don’t. They fought? Sun Jun even borrowed money from Gu Daqiang!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It was at the graduation banquet."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin recalled, "Was it because of Ah Zhen?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I'm afraid that was the case."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I just remember that during the banquet, Ah Qiang ran over to our class to announce that he and Ah Zhen were dating. The two had kept it a secret before. Then Ah Qiang took Ah Zhen's hand and led her to the table for his class. Maybe the fight had taken place there. Our banquet wasn’t in a private room."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I see, it seems that you don't know Sun Jun well too!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"We only came into contact after I started work and we weren’t acquainted at school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi asked, "You lent Sun Jun 200,000, didn’t you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You knew that he was a gambling addict, so why would you still lend him money? With your income, 200,000 isn’t much, but it isn’t a small sum either."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I know what kind of person he was, but he kept begging me during that time. The only thing he didn’t do was kowtow on the spot. He said that he needed to borrow this money to repay the loan sharks. After repaying the debt, he would start afresh. At that time, he had a million in debt. With Ah Qiang’s persuasion, I lent him 200,000 and Ah Qiang lent him 300,000. Honestly speaking, my heart was bleeding when I lent this money out. Would this kind of person repay it? Sure enough, the dog can’t change his habit of eating shit. He went to gamble again with the money, and since then, I have pretended that I didn’t know him. I’ve already helped him as a friend. He could extort someone else!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Looking at this, it seems that Ah Qiang had a good relationship with him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It was pretty good. Even after fighting in university, being in the same city after starting work is fate. When I was attending university, I had some conflict with my roommates, but after meeting them again in a few years, we became extremely close.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi, "This murderer can log in to Ah Zhen's QQ, indicating that their relationship must be very close."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I think so as well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Ah!" Liu Qin shouted, "I remember now that Ah Zhen's QQ space isn’t open to the public. She had the habit of writing diary entries. You can check that out. Maybe there’s a clue!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The information department couldn't figure it out. The quickest way was to go to Ah Zhen's house. Liu Qin asked to go with them because he was too scared to stay alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Arriving at Ah Zhen's residence, Liu Qin knelt at the entrance, kowtowed three times towards the empty house and repeatedly said, “Sorry! Sorry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue remembered that a boy had gone to the reservoir to swim and drowned back in junior high school. When the news came out, she had been shocked beyond description. Only when death came to someone around her, could she feel the weight and suddenness of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin's casual words on WeChat that day had directly led to the death of Ah Zhen, and his psychological burden must have been very great at that moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This was Lin Dongxue's first visit to Ah Zhen's house, which was neater than any house she had ever seen. The furniture was spotless and delicate handicrafts on the shelves revealed the owner's sensitivity and delicate nature.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She saw a glass jar full of small, colorful origami stars. Liu Qin said, "Officer Lin, you can open it and take a look."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue poured out a few and took them apart. It turned out that each little star had words written in them. The handwriting was beautiful and regular. They read, “I hope Ah Qiang doesn’t always swear, as it’s not cool at all”, “I hope his knee injury gets better soon. He is always pulling a long face, and he hasn’t smiled at me for three days.”, “I saw Ah Qiang talking to the girl. I was very sad and couldn't sleep. Maybe I’m thinking too much.”, “My world only has him in it, but there are many people in his world who come and go. Is it despicable of me to be always wanting to tie him down?”, “I always stare at the dialog box after saying ‘Good night’ hoping that we could talk a bit more. It’d be nice if he knew.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">These fragments revealed a girl's heart that was as sensitive and fragile as a drinking glass. She could also see her strong love for Ah Qiang. Lin Dongxue was moved by reading them. When she thought that she had already passed away, her eyes began to sting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi was reading them next to her. "The handwriting leans to the right, indicating that she was a very emotional person. Also, these words seem to be framed by an invisible frame, which shows that there was an invisible cage in her heart. She had severe obsessive-compulsive disorder."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Go away. How hateful. Who asked you to analyze here!" Lin Dongxue pushed him away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi shrugged helplessly. Liu Qin, who hadn’t spoken, was crying silently. He wiped his tears away with his sleeves, afraid that the tears would fall on the paper slips. "This is what I taught her. If you have a wish, write it on a piece of paper and turn it into a little star, so that you will feel a bit better.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Liu Qin, I couldn’t tell how sensitive you are. Have you always been gay?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I’ve loved men since junior high, so we were like good sisters."</span></p>
