 <p>After filling the soil pit, kk went up and stepped on it with his feet. Sun Zhen was instantly enraged as he pushed him away and shouted, "Motherfucker, don’t step on it with your feet!"</p>
 <p>"If I don’t make it solid, what would happen if it was dug up by a wild dog?"</p>
 <p>"Screw you."</p>
 <p>"Enough!" Chen Shi stopped the two of them from fighting, took out a pack of cigarettes from his arms, lit three of them, and stuck them in the ground like a shabby mourning ritual.</p>
 <p>The three of them stood silently. After the mourning was over, Chen Shi turned to face the two of them. "Do you guys have anything you’re hiding?"</p>
 <p>"Cough!" Sun Zhen cleared his throat. "Yes... but I swear I’ve never harmed you guys."</p>
 <p>kk said, "Yes, but it's the more nasty kind."</p>
 <p>"Okay, I also have something I’m hiding from you guys." Chen Shi said. He planned to practice revealing his true identity here. At the very least, he wouldn’t be so nervous when he confessed to Lin Dongxue and Lin Qiupu.</p>
 <p>The two looked at Chen Shi in astonishment. When he prepared to speak, the words swirled around his mouth, but he just couldn't say it. Sun Zhen said, "Brother Chen, if you don't want to say it, just forget it. Who doesn't have secrets?"</p>
 <p>"Brother Chen!" kk ran back to the car and brought out an envelope. "I know that boy Zhou Xiao is moving around happily right now. I can't really help much. This is the information I know from some people in the underworld. Maybe it can help you."</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen said, “By the way, I investigated Zhou Xiao’s boyfriend. They spoke to each other on a gay dating forum. Zhou Xiao’s account was logged in five times before and after that and three IP addresses were used. His hideout clues may be among them."</p>
 <p>"Thank you, guys. You must be careful by yourselves and let the police do the risky things."</p>
 <p>"Don't worry about that!" kk promised loudly, and then found that Sun Zhen was looking at him with contempt.</p>
 <p>After getting in the car, the three of them took one last look at the place where Gu You was buried. Under that piece of ground was Gu You. This intellectual, elegant, clever, and decisive woman was laying there silently now. The thought of this made their hearts heavy.</p>
 <p>"Is it okay to go missing?" Sun Zhen said.</p>
 <p>"The moment you see the broken body of your lover, that kind of impact is beyond your imagination. It will cause a lifetime shadow!" Chen Shi said weakly. "Although a disappearance would also cause a mess in his heart, there’s at least still a glimmer of hope... If I die in the future, if conditions permit, please let me go missing as well."</p>
 <p>The two looked at each other, not knowing how to answer.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was interrupted by the sound of footsteps. He looked up and saw Lin Dongxue come in. Lin Dongxue asked him what he was doing there alone. Chen Shi smiled bitterly. "I’m too tired."</p>
 <p>"Nothing will probably happen tonight. You can go home and rest!"</p>
 <p>"It's okay. I'll stay with you."</p>
 <p>From the corridor came Xu Xiaodong’s wailing. "My mother has been kidnapped! My mother has been kidnapped!"</p>
 <p>The two hurried out and asked what was wrong. Xu Xiaodong said that he had just called his mother. Although his mother answered, the way his mother spoke was a little unnatural.</p>
 <p>When he hung up the phone, Xu Xiaodong felt strange about the call the more he thought about it, so he checked the location software installed on his mother's phone and found that she was moving at a high speed on a road. Then, the location signal suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "I'll call everyone over."</p>
 <p>The people who stayed behind in the bureau gathered in a conference room and asked Xu Xiaodong to describe the situation in detail. He said that his mother's positioning signal disappeared on the Sihuan Road. She was moving northward and had just passed the Shuiku road.</p>
 <p>The conversation between the two on the phone was just about some daily content. What made Xu Xiaodong feel strange was the way his mother spoke. His mother seemed a little irritable. Everyone knew that Xu Xiaodong’s mother was very gentle. It was assumed that she might have been threatened and forced to pretend to act like normal as she informed her son of her safety.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, "They’re planning a fourth case. If Xu Xiaodong hadn't noticed it, I'm afraid we would still be in the dark."</p>
 <p>This time, they knew the movements of Zhou Xiao and Ling Shuang in advance. Naturally, they couldn't delay. Lin Qiupu ordered everyone to find clues separately. Everyone dragged their tired bodies to move, and Xu Xiaodong was anxious to go home to have a look.</p>
 <p>Originally, Lin Dongxue and Chen Shi wanted to accompany him, but Lin Dongxue found out that Chen Shi was missing. She finally found him at the stairway at the end of the corridor. Lin Dongxue said, "Hurry up!"</p>
 <p>"I... I need to go back." Chen Shi's expression was a bit odd.</p>
 <p>"Yueyue?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi nodded. "I haven’t been able to get through to her phone and the positioning signal is showing that she’s at home. I know that leaving at this juncture is really..."</p>
 <p>"Go!" Lin Dongxue said decisively, "I understand your feelings!"</p>
 <p>"I'll be back after confirming."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi left. He hoped that it would be a mistake. Zhou Xiao wouldn’t kidnap two people at the same time, and he wasn’t a policeman!</p>
 <p>However, this kind of thinking was self-deceptive. Zhou Xiao's motives had long been revealed, and an accomplice of his had been arrested already. He was very likely to speed up his pace and kidnap all the people whom they wanted to kill in advance.</p>
 <p>On the way back, Chen Shi kept begging,&nbsp;<em>Don’t let anything to have happened. Don’t let anything to have happened!</em></p>
 <p>Pushing open the door to the house, the house was dark. Chen Shi turned on all the lights and opened every door, but Tao Yueyue was nowhere to be seen. The blankets on the bed were neatly folded and her school bag was placed on the chair, which showed that she may not have gone to school today!</p>
 <p>Chen Shi dialed the number of Tao Yueyue's class teacher. Being awakened at this time, the class teacher's voice was full of dissatisfaction. "Who is it?!"</p>
 <p>"I’m Tao Yueyue's parent. Did she go to school today?"</p>
 <p>"Tao Yueyue's parent..." After a few seconds, the other person's talking resumed, "Oh, she was absent from class today."</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you call to inform me?!?!"</p>
 <p>"This... Tao Yueyue is excellent in her academic performance and has never asked for leave a single time. I figured that if it wasn’t for a special reason, she definitely wouldn’t miss class. I thought you’d call to explain."</p>
 <p>"Okay..." Chen Shi instantly became dizzy and apologized for his tone just then. "I'm sorry."</p>
 <p>"It's okay. Did she not go home? You can contact her friends or go to an Internet cafe to try and find her."</p>
 <p>When he hung up the phone, Chen Shi was full of self-blame. Tao Yueyue had been missing for a whole day. He looked around Tao Yueyue’s bedroom and tried to find clues. He found a notebook on the table. Picking it up, the contents seemed to be left for him.</p>
 <p>After reading all the content, Chen Shi's mood was indescribable. It was already 5:00AM and the sky outside the window began to turn lighter.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue called, "Old Chen, how is Yueyue?"</p>
 <p>"..."</p>
 <p>"Old Chen?!"</p>
 <p>"She's all right. All right." Chen Shi lied. "What about your side?"</p>
 <p>"The lead was lost. They killed a driver in the countryside, robbed the other person's car, and dumped their original car. There’s no security cameras nearby, and we can’t track them anymore."</p>
 <p>"I'll be right there!"</p>
