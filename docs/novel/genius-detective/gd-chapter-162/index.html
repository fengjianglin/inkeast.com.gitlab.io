<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Chen Shi stopped the video at the moment Lu Zhendong passed by. He went back and played it again, then again, and then again.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhendong did two things when he passed the gate of the community: He swiped his access card and nodded his head in greeting.</p>
 <p>However, due to the angle, only one hand picking up the access card and Lu Zhendong's jaw moving a little could be seen.</p>
 <p>The access card was infrared-sensitive and did not need to be put all the way up. As long as it was aligned with the sensor, the bar at the gate of the community would have been lifted.</p>
 <p>After looking at it four or five times, someone found something suspicious. "The position of the hand is wrong. It seems that it wasn’t Lu Zhendong's hand but is stretching from the back."</p>
 <p>"I noticed that too."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi exclaimed, "Yes! Can this video be adjusted so that the contrast is higher?"</p>
 <p>The policeman operated the playback software. As the contrast increased, the grains of the picture became more and more dense, giving people a creepy feeling. The conference room was extremely quiet as Chen Shi continuously directed, "Go forward one frame… One frame forward... Stop!"</p>
 <p>Staring at the picture, many people inhaled sharply.</p>
 <p>In the frame where Lu Zhendong nodded, a hand appeared on his chin. It was a hand in black gloves. Due to the dim light in the car and the shadow of Lu Zhendong's chin, it was difficult to see under normal circumstances.</p>
 <p>The gesture of nodding his head at the security guard was exactly done by this hand supporting his chin.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi concluded, "Lu Zhendong, who was in the car at that time, was dead, and the murderer was preparing to get him out of the residence."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong asked, "How do the dead drive?"</p>
 <p>"This is a German car. The car is very spacious. The driver's seat can seat two people. Lu Zhendong's body is leaning on the driver. From the perspective of security and surveillance monitors, it is as if he’s sitting in the driver's seat."</p>
 <p>"Seat two people? Wouldn’t that be too crowded?" Someone objected.</p>
 <p>"It's okay if you're petite, like a petite woman." Another police officer suggested.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue analyzed, "The human head is very heavy, but this hand can hold the head with one hand, indicating that this person has some strength. It may be a man."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong said, "I found that this hand is the right hand. This person should have been behind the driver’s seat… It should have also been this hand who aligned the access card as well.”</p>
 <p>This showed that there were three people in the car at the time. The driver, the body of Lu Zhendong, and the person lying behind the driver's seat.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi rewound the video to the earliest time period and watched through the video again with faster playback speed. Shortly after Jia Xingyun left, a black motorcycle appeared at the door with a rider in a black leather suit. Because the community had security guards, the rider stopped on one leg, said a few words, and left.</p>
 <p>The rider also wore black gloves.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue remarked, "This person should be the murderer?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi agreed. "It’s very likely that the security guard didn’t let them in. They may have parked the motorcycle near the community and came in through the wall ... The wall of the community isn’t very high and scavengers often climb in."</p>
 <p>Old Zhang asked, "Where did the driver come from?"</p>
 <p>The eyes of everyone focused on Chen Shi's face. Chen Shi reasoned, "The driver has been in the deceased's house the whole time and may have been imprisoned there by Lu Zhendong. Lu Zhendong asked the cleaner to stop coming over temporarily for half a month before the incident and bought a lot of frozen food."</p>
 <p>"Hidden treasure in the golden house? Is it a woman?" Lin Dongxue said in shock.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi immediately assigned the tasks. Some would find the owner of the black motorcycle, while some would talk to the security guard and the shop owner outside the district again. He also thought that Lu Zhendong's company should be focused on to see if any company employees recently bought medicine and what medicines they bought.</p>
 <p>Of course, another important point was to visit Jia Xingyun again.</p>
 <p>Old Zhang asked, "Then, our current prime suspect, the missing Sun Shenyou, and the guitar don't need to be checked again?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "That was a smoke bomb cast by the murderer. The guitar was not the motive for killing. But we do need to find Sun Shenyou again. I’m not suspecting that she killed him. I suspect she has been detained by Old Man Lu ... Everyone, let's get off work!"</p>
 <p>At this time, it was already 7PM. Tao Yueyue, who was waiting outside, was very hungry. Chen Shi said, "Sorry, I’ll take you to dinner! What do you want to eat?"</p>
 <p>"The stuff from yesterday."</p>
 <p>"That's too expensive. Change it."</p>
 <p>"Fast food!"</p>
 <p>Walking out while holding Tao Yueyue's hand, a luxury car parked in front of the city bureau. Old Man Lu stepped down with the help of a lawyer and said, "Officer Song, you’re bullying me again. Can we stop this?”</p>
 <p>"It's good to have money. You must have paid a lot of money in bail!” Chen Shi laughed.</p>
 <p>"Those are trivial... Officer Song, have you eaten yet? I'll invite you to dinner!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Tao Yueyue, "Do you want to go?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue whispered, "Will the atmosphere be awkward?"</p>
 <p>"It won’t, you just have to focus on eating."</p>
 <p>"Then we’ll go. I want to eat something delicious."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi turned his face and said with a smile, "Since Old Man Lu is entertaining, I will most respectfully accept. This is a cold day, let’s eat hot pot!"</p>
 <p>"Have you not eaten anything good besides hot pot?! I’ll invite you to a big French meal! Get in the car!"</p>
 <p>When they got to a high-end French restaurant, Lu Qixing found that Chen Shi and Tao Yueyue were really impolite. They ordered everything they hadn’t eaten before on the menu. At their economic level, they would have never ordered anything except bread.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took a piece of garlic bread with caviar and rolled it with foie gras. He also held a glass of red wine in his hand. Tao Yueyue fell in love with the large French snails and drew them out of their shells one after the other to eat.</p>
 <p>Lu Qixing barely moved his knife and fork. He asked Tao Yueyue with a smile, "Are the snails delicious?"</p>
 <p>"It's delicious! Thank you, Grandpa."</p>
 <p>"Do you want to eat it every day?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!"</p>
 <p>"Old man, why aren’t you eating?" Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>"I'm not hungry!" Lu Qixing said. "I haven't seen anyone eat so much and so happily in front of me for a long time. People who sit at a table with me are either asking something from me, or I’m asking something from them. No matter what we eat, it’s never fragrant<span id="footnote-ref-ed89"><a href="#footnote-ed89">[1]</a></span>.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stopped and said, "This meal isn’t free for me though, right?"</p>
 <p>"Officer Song..."</p>
 <p>"You forgot? My last name is Chen!"</p>
 <p>Lu Qixing glanced at his sleeve and said, "Yes, yes. Mr. Chen, I think you are very capable. It’s a waste of your talents to help the police solve cases. Why don’t you come to our company? I’ll let you eat these every day.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "What can I do at your company? Pour you tea?"</p>
 <p>"You can help me pick out those who have bad intentions and help me analyze and defeat competitors. The important thing is that you can make a lot of money. I am old now. After starting from scratch and struggling for a lifetime, I’ve only attained a bleak night. Every day I watch the shareholders meet to discuss how to allocate my money. I wanted to laugh. They all hoped that I would die sooner so that they could take possession of everything. I hope there will be a trustworthy person around me to help me take care of everything. Mr. Chen I like you very much, and I think that people like you should make use of your talents in a wider space and live a better life."</p>
 <p>"But I'm not short of money!"</p>
 <p>Lu Qixing laughed. "Not short of money? In my eyes, every one of you is short of money!"</p>
