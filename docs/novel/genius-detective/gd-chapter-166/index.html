 <p>A police officer was sent by Chen Shi to monitor the window of Cheng Yan's house while the others went to the Internet Café to surf the net comfortably. The internet café was already bought out and could be used as they pleased.</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong opened the game they played last time and Chen Shi saw him in golden equipment, riding a donkey-like and unicorn-like mount. Chen Shi said, "Are you still playing this money-sucking online game?"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong nodded and explained slowly, "My wife supports me and gives me all the equipment I need to level-up quickly."</p>
 <p>"Your wife?" Lin Dongxue raised an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>"In the game!" Xu Xiaodong explained.</p>
 <p>At this time, a few boys came in to access the Internet. The owner of the Internet cafe claimed that it had been reserved and the boys walked away angrily. Chen Shi called Old Zhang to call them back in and told them that they could access the Internet for free, but only on certain designated machines. Also, they weren’t allowed to tell anyone about it.</p>
 <p>The boys who were called back were very happy. They handed cigarettes to Chen Shi and said, "Uncle, are you a police officer? Are you on a secret mission?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi glanced at the perspiration around his lips and said, "You aren’t 18 years old yet, right? I won't hold you accountable today. After you finish going on the computers, go home and do your winter vacation homework… Also, don’t talk to us.”</p>
 <p>"Tch, you’re just police! Is that meant to be amazing or something?"</p>
 <p>Three or four waves of children came in one after another and the Internet cafe finally became lively. Chen Shi had his reason. If Cheng Yan came in and found it was just full of uncles who weren’t talking, she’d definitely be suspicious.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue sighed. "The net is cast, so now we just need to wait for the canary."</p>
 <p>The police didn’t know what to do. After all, they didn’t usually go online. Someone started up League of Legends and got an immediate response. Everyone split into two teams and faced each other.</p>
 <p>The losing party was extremely annoyed and some people asked, "Who’s the marksman? Is it Brother Chen?"</p>
 <p>"No!" Chen Shi held his cigarette butt, his face was full of boredom. "I'm the Teemo you dumped on the ground."</p>
 <p>The curious police officer looked around and walked in front of Lin Dongxue. She suddenly minimized the window and pretended to be listening to a song. The crowd said, "Dongxue, it wouldn't be you, right?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue then opened the game interface. It was indeed her and it caused a burst of exclamation. Lin Dongxue was embarrassed to say, "I have played with my brother for a bit. It’s not that I’m skilled. It’s just that you guys are too bad.”</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, come carry me! I'll come to the red team." Chen Shi changed his attitude immediately.</p>
 <p>"Brother Chen, you are too cunning!"</p>
 <p>While waiting for the game to start, Chen Shi called the police officer on monitoring duty. The policeman said that Cheng Yan hadn't moved yet, as she was still sleeping. Chen Shi said, "It's cold below. You can come up first. Xiaodong will come down and take over.”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong said sadly, "Why me?"</p>
 <p>"Did you come to play? You still have to do your duty. Hurry up!" Chen Shi continued to play the game.</p>
 <p>They played until 9:00 when Xu Xiaodong came up to report. "She got up."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi told everyone to stop the game and sent a police officer who looked the fiercest to visit her. Everyone waited quietly. Twenty minutes later, the officer that was sent out came back and said, "A lot of questions were asked. It felt like she was nervous."</p>
 <p>"Okay, you should find a place to hide or go back to the bureau." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went to the bar table and stared at the monitoring interface of the Internet cafe. About an hour later, Cheng Yan appeared, neatly dressed. She really came to this Internet Cafe. Chen Shi explained to everyone to behave normally and they all hurriedly did their own things.</p>
 <p>All the officers appeared to be watching a TV show or playing a game, but they stared at the entrance with their eyes.</p>
 <p>Cheng Yan finally came in and her expression seemed to be particularly heavy. She didn't notice any difference. She ordered a computer at the bar and started to surf the Internet. Her position was just where Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue could see, but that whole empty row was arranged intentionally by Chen Shi.</p>
 <p>Cheng Yan once again went to a forum, typed in a private message window, and waited for an answer. While others glanced at her, they were exchanging information through a chat software.</p>
 <p>An hour later, Cheng Yan got off the computer and walked away. Chen Shi only stood up after she disappeared outside. A few children in the Internet cafe chanted, "Not letting us go?!"</p>
 <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Keep playing, we’ll let you go soon!"</p>
 <p>The policemen went to the computer used by Cheng Yan and turned on the machine. The forum she had logged in to could be seen and she had not logged out of the machine, meaning they could directly access her account.</p>
 <p>It was an ordinary film and television drama exchange forum. Chen Shi opened a private message window and could only see the contents of today's call, but that was enough.</p>
 <p>Yan: The police just came to see me. They seem to suspect us.</p>
 <p>Yan: Are you there?</p>
 <p>Yan: Fucking come out for me!</p>
 <p>Mak: Why are you so anxious?</p>
 <p>Mak: Say everything just like we rehearsed. The police are all like this. They will deliberately lie to you. Don't be fooled.</p>
 <p>Yan: But I'm so scared! I miss you! I feel like I can't handle it anymore. Can you come see me tonight?</p>
 <p>Mak: I miss you too, but we must never meet right now. We can't let the police guess we have a relationship with each other!</p>
 <p>Mak: Did you burn those letters?</p>
 <p>Yan: Yes, the ashes should be in the sewers now.</p>
 <p>Mak: Look, the police and the Lu family are investigating the missing person. There are no loopholes in my plan.</p>
 <p>Yan: What if the body is found?</p>
 <p>Mak: Impossible. The police can't find it. They think the person is just missing. The crime detection rate is not as high as it is on TV. Many cases will often remain unsolved for over ten years. Rest assured, we can successfully survive the calamity this time because God is helping us!</p>
 <p>Yan: Miss you! Miss you! Miss you!</p>
 <p>Mak: I miss you too, very much so. Dear, don't be discouraged. Don't show vulnerabilities, even in front of the police. Some questions can be left unanswered. This is your right, understood?</p>
 <p>Yan: I understand! I'm going to an interview later. The address is at xxx. Why don’t you come over? I just need to look at you. We don’t need to talk.</p>
 <p>Mak: I can't come! I love you, so I must be cautious and even more so. Be careful while you’re alone.</p>
 <p>Yan: Don't worry, I look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
 <p>Mak: I look forward to it too.</p>
 <p>After reading this chat, everyone exchanged a look of surprise. The moment when the real murderer finally surfaced was always very exciting.</p>
 <p>"Brother Chen's speculation was absolutely correct!" Xu Xiaodong admired.</p>
 <p>"Cheng Yan doesn't seem to be a murderer. This 'Mak' must be. Find a way to catch him!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pointed to the two lines of "Fucking come out for me!" and "Why are you so anxious?" and said, "The tone is obviously inconsistent with the rest of the chat. These two sentences should be secret codes!"</p>
 <p>He put his hand on the keyboard and pondered about it. Lin Dongxue asked, "Can you learn her tone? It would be odd if you could!"</p>
 <p>"Check the IP address!" Xu Xiaodong said.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi accepted the two's proposals and gave up the original bold snake-baiting plan. He said, "Call a network policeman to come over and check it. By the way, ask Old Peng to come here as well. Tell him to remember to bring their fingerprints and DNA collection equipment."</p>
