 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin glanced at her watch. The thiopental sodium in the coffee should have already taken effect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without saying anything to anyone, she quietly left the sales office, took out a black bag from the fire-fighting cabinet in the corner, and walked into the underground parking lot by the elevator corridor. She emptied out her coat, hat, mask, folding knife, and gloves from the bag. She quickly tied up her hair, stuffed it into the hat, checked the edge, and made sure that no hair was exposed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then she put on gloves, mask and coat. She looked like an ordinary maintenance worker.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She tested the sharpness of the blade. She was determined to kill. Originally, she had planned to stop after she killed three people in succession and alarmed the police. However, she couldn't bear it. The man surnamed Chen had actually done such a thing. He should pay the price for his arrogance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Staring at the blade, she hesitated. If a police consultant dies in the parking lot of the sales office, the police will inevitably shift their attention here, and they will invest more resources and energy in investigating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But she had to do it!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin walked softly into the parking lot and searched everywhere. At that moment, there were no outsiders in the parking lot. She finally saw Chen Shi sitting in a Porsche with the door open, slumped in the driver's seat and fast asleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You asked for it!" she whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gradually approached Chen Shi, stretched her left hand towards his head, and reached under his neck with the knife in her right hand. At that moment, an electric current flowed through her body, and she screamed, instinctively trying to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other party didn’t give her this opportunity and continued to stab her body with a stun gun. Gong Jianqin fell to the ground, her body stiffened due to the electric shock, and she kept twitching. She turned her head angrily. The person who ambushed her was actually the young girl who had been brought to view the house by the man surnamed Chen that day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The stun gun had been prepared by Chen Shi in advance, and Tao Yueyue was using it for the first time. She had just hid in the dark and watched the woman approaching Chen Shi. Her heart was beating like a drum, but she still waited for the best time to rush out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The murderer collapsed. Tao Yueyue didn’t stop there. She put the stun gun on her opponent’s neck and kept shocking her. Gong Jianqin screamed loudly. The electrical power seemed to be running out. Tao Yueyue, who was afraid her opponent would resist, dropped the stun gun immediately and picked up a belt, which she had removed from Chen Shi's body. From behind, she strangled Gong Jianqin's neck and pressed her knees against her spine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin brandished her knife in pain but couldn't slash Tao Yueyue at all. Tao Yueyue calmly counted, "One, two, three, four..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It takes fifteen seconds to cause a person to fall into a coma. This is what Gu You had told her. When she counted to fourteen, Gong Jianqin rolled her eyes back and her head suddenly became heavy. Tao Yueyue stopped and kicked away the knife from her opponent’s hands. Then she dragged her hands behind her back and tied them tightly with the belt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything went smoothly, but when she calmed down, her little heart thumped wildly. If something had gone wrong and they ended up grappling each other, she was definitely not her match, not to speak of being able to protect Chen Shi at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue took a few deep breaths, calmed herself down, and shook Chen Shi, "Uncle Chen, get up quickly. We’re safe."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only answer she got was snoring, which made Tao Yueyue a little angry, as she had risked her own safety to subdue the murderer. The result was that he slept through it all and even snored... Although she knew that it was the effect of anesthetic in her heart, she was still unhappy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue used the stun gun, which had little power left and stabbed the back of Chen Shi's hand. Chen Shi woke up and his eyes were blank. He was dumbfounded. He said, "Luoxi? Where are you?" It seemed that he was still lost in his dream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I settled it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh?" Chen Shi glanced at Gong Jianqin who was lying on the ground, and only reacted then. "Call the police!" Then he fell asleep again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Chen Shi woke up in the hospital, his brain was still dizzy due to the effects of the anesthetic. He was thirsty and tried to reach the cup by the bed, but the cup fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sound of the cup shattering into pieces alarmed the medical staff, and a nurse came in and asked, "Sir, do you need help?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who sent me here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The police."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh... I remember now. Am I okay?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's okay, it's just that you accidentally swallowed an anesthetic. You have been checked and there won’t be any serious effects.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’m thirsty. Can you please pour me a glass of water?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, wait a minute."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For some reason, the nurse held back a smile the whole time. Chen Shi wondered if there was something on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He lay down and slept for a while again, and then was shaken awake. He opened his eyes and saw&nbsp;</span><span>Lin</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Dongxue's beautiful fair face. Lin Dongxue smiled and asked, "Are you stupid? Why did you use yourself as bait?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If I didn't do that, she might have run away. Even if I caught her, there’s no conclusive evidence... Oh yes, what happened after I fell into a coma?" Chen Shi put his hand on the back of her hand as he spoke. He couldn’t remember what had happened when he woke up halfway through at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue helped him up and gave him water. "You have to thank Tao Yueyue. I didn't expect this child to be so brave and decisive. She captured the murderer by herself. When the police arrived at the scene, they were shocked!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Like father, like daughter." Chen Shi smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't do such dangerous things in the future. At least, call me up to come with you. I’m really worried about you doing things alone."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren't you angry with me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue glanced at him and smiled, "Where is your official apology?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, I formally apologize. I won't make you angry anymore. I shouldn't have said those hurtful things."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I accept your apology, and I shouldn't have peeked at your phone... It's just that you usually leave it around, so I just occasionally look at it, but I didn't really want to peek. When I thought about it later, you and Su Ruijuan shouldn’t have anything going on between you two. Otherwise, why would you have kept the chat log?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Women are oversensitive. I just dealt with some of Wang Daji's funeral matters. Did you think that since I look exactly the same as Wang Daji, I’d go over and take advantage of her? Am I that kind of shameless person?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue smiled again when she heard the word "shameless". Chen Shi didn't know why she was smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue recalled, "Hey, speaking of Wang Daji, you once behaved strangely in front of me. Was it possible that the person talking to me back then wasn’t you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Let me rest for a while longer. My brain is so numb that I can't remember what the next line after ‘Bright moonlight before my bed' is. <span id="footnote-ref-fe31"><a href="#footnote-fe31">[1]</a></span>" Chen Shi evaded the question. He couldn't let Dongxue learn too much about Wang Daji.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go to sleep!" Lin Dongxue covered him up with the blanket. "When you wake up, let's go to interrogate the woman..." When she walked to the door, Lin Dongxue reminded him, "Don't forget to wash your face when you wake up, and wash it carefully!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After she left, Chen Shi suddenly reacted and looked around for a mirror. He couldn’t find one, so he had to use the phone's selfie function instead. It turned out that he had a ‘tortoise’ drawn on his face. He had just been talking to the nurse and Lin Dongxue with this face. It was no wonder that they were laughing.</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue must have done it. He had to teach her a lesson when he went back. Thinking about this, Chen Shi fell asleep again.</span></p>
