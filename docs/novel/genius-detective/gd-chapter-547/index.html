 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah<span id="footnote-ref-4cb5"><a href="#footnote-4cb5">[1]</a></span> Zhen: Are you there?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: I can’t sleep. I’m so miserable. Can you talk with me?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen:?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: Fuck. Do you have to be like this? You just got jilted. Why haven’t you gotten over it yet? You’re too narrow-minded, aren’t you?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: I want to die!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: Oh save that crap. Go wash up and go to sleep!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: When you’re sad, try not to listen to sad songs and watch those weepy Korean dramas. You should read more unconstrained poems. A person needs to look further ahead and just be heartless like me. See how well I live!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: Thank you!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: It’s okay, don’t think too much. Just go to sleep. That man is a scum. There’s no need to shed tears for him. Who hasn’t experienced such a thing as a breakup? Be more mature!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: Alright.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: Sorry for bothering you.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: Hello, this is Zhang Jianjun, a policeman from the Long'an Public Security Bureau. The owner of this phone died after falling off a building half an hour ago. I need to verify her identity with you.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: *A message was withdrawn*</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: Stop teasing me. How could she commit suicide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ah Zhen: Please tell me your mobile phone number!!!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Mieba: Fuck, really?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>In the middle of the night on September 25</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">, there were police sirens flashing in the Taohuayuan housing district. The woman who had fallen from the building was surrounded by the police cordon. The police were taking photos and fixing the area. Some residents ran down to watch in their pajamas and were stopped by the police outside the cordon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Zhang had a mobile phone with a broken screen in his hands. On WeChat, the friend who had chatted with her last finally sent over information on her identity. The deceased's name was Ai Lizhen. She graduated from XX University and had been working for three years. She worked as a telemarketer in an investment company.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Zhang copied the information down and looked at the female corpse on the ground with emotion, "Haii, so young."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A policeman came down. "No outsiders have been in the house. The door was locked from the inside and the window was open. This was found on the table!" It was a suicide note, and some of the writing had already been blurred. Old Zhang sniffed it to confirm that it was wet from tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It seems to be a suicide. Take the body away quickly! Hey, don't take pictures. There’s nothing to see here. Go back to sleep!" The last sentence was directed towards a grinning young man who was taking photos just outside the cordon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A car drove into the housing district and two youngsters came out, rushing into the cordon regardless of the police's obstruction. Old Zhang said, "What are you doing? Hurry and get out. The police are handling the case!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A guy in a red plaid shirt who reeked of alcohol cried and pointed at himself. "I was the one on WeChat just now, Mieba. I killed her! I should have figured it out earlier, why didn't I figure it out... Ah Zhen, Ah Zhen, wake up!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The guy knelt beside the body and cried. The guy in the leather jacket stood next to him, looking sad. He shook his head and sighed for a while, then took out a cigarette and got ready to light it up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Zhang said, "No smoking here!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I’m not trying to smoke. I want to mourn Ah Zhen."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Stop shedding crocodile tears!" The guy in the red plaid shirt stood up and pushed him. "Officer, arrest him. It was this scumbag who played with her emotions and caused Ah Zhen to commit suicide! It's all your fault!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What do you mean? The last person that she contacted was you. If it weren't for your words, would she die?" The guy in the leather jacket countered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two of them looked like they were about to get into a fight. The police quickly persuaded them to stay away from each other. Old Zhang smelled alcohol on them and asked, "Who drove the car?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The guy in the leather jacket pointed to the guy in the red plaid. "He did!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Drinking and driving? Take him away!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The guy in the red plaid wailed and shook them off, trying to kick the guy in the leather jacket in order to vent his anger. When he was taken into the police car, he was still shouting, "Ah Qiang, karma will get you! It definitely will!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Hearing the word "karma", the guy in the leather jacket felt a little lingering fear. Old Zhang came over and asked, "What is your name? What is your relationship with the deceased?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Gu Daqiang. I just broke up with her."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Because of what?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"Because I had found someone else. You can ask any one of our friends and they’d tell you that, but it’s not true! I know it’s bad to speak ill of the dead, but Ah Zhen was too insecure and was suspicious of everything. As long as I was one second late replying to a text message, she’d suspect that I was with another woman. Do you know what the reason the last time that we quarreled was? Wasn’t a province in the south flooded? Everyone in our company donated as a group. I donated a thousand dollars. After she found out about it, she started overthinking. She said that my ex-girlfriend was from that province and asked if it was because of this reason that I donated so much. I said that she was mad and refused to answer her unreasonable questions. She cried and scolded me. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I suggested that we break up. About a week after the breakup, I found another girlfriend. This incident reached her ears, and she started to overthink it, thinking that I had met someone else long ago, which caused us to break up. She would vent her&nbsp;</span><span>grievances</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;to people everywhere, just like Xianglin’s widow<span id="footnote-ref-1a8f"><a href="#footnote-1a8f">[2]</a></span>. Our friends all came to criticize me. Don’t you think I’m being wrongly accused? Officer, she committed suicide, right? It’s got nothing to do with me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"We’re still investigating whether she committed suicide. What is the name of the guy from just now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Liu Qin. We were all classmates."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You two were together?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"We were just drinking, and we were at the Bluebird Bar on Erma Road from 10:00 in the evening until we received the text message."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Zhang recorded the information down while listening. He finally said, "Okay, thank you for your cooperation. Leave down your contact information and we will inform you if there’s progress."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Gu Daqiang shook his head. "No need, she must have committed suicide. I should have known. I want some peace and quiet for the next two days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Gu Daqiang took his leave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After the site investigation was completed, the police loaded the body into the van and returned to the bureau. Old Zhang was on duty that night. In fact, he had been exposed to too many such suicide cases ever since he became an officer. Compared with those earth-shattering murders, it didn’t seem like a big event.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Back at the bureau, a police officer brought a detention document over and asked Old Zhang to sign it. When he read "Liu Qin" on it, Old Zhang said, "He’s a drunk driver. Why was he detained here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You didn't tell us earlier!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Forget it. Leave him here first. Tomorrow, I’ll contact the traffic department and let them deal with it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Just before he got off work, Old Zhang went to take a look at Liu Qin. He sat very dejectedly in a solo detention room. Old Zhang asked, "Are you sober yet?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Liu Qin nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"Although there aren't many cars at night, it was still too dangerous for you to do so. I know that things&nbsp;</span><span>have</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;happened suddenly, but there are no exceptions before the law."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Did she leave a suicide note or something?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"She did, but I can't show it to you right now. We have to wait until we’ve completely ruled out homicide.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I really shouldn't have said those words back then, really... I'm practically a pig, why didn't I notice it?!" Liu Qin covered his face with great pain. "You can punish me. Shoot or jail me, I’d take it. I was the one who killed her!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Zhang shook his head. "Don't blame yourself. She’s already gone. Get some rest!”</span></p>
