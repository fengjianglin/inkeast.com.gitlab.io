 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After Chen Shi finished speaking, Gao Xiaohui became flustered, and she stood up, yelling, “You held blood in your mouth to squirt at me!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span id="footnote-ref-4021"><a href="#footnote-4021">[1]</a></span></span> This is all just speculation. How can you prove all that just from a piece of clothing? Either way, I have proof of my absence!”</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gao Xiaohui took out a receipt for the dinner again and handed it to Chen Shi. Chen Shi waved it down, “This paper holds no legal value unless there is another party to confirm it. How about you call those people you ate with to testify?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gao Xiaohui was very flustered and desperately thought of ways to refute Chen Shi, trying to hide her shaking hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“The evidence doesn’t stop here.” Chen Shi educated her, “You probably don't know this, but Gu Mengxing’s personal life isn’t that honest, so her boyfriend installed a tracker on her phone to see if she was cheating. You were holding her mobile phone at the time and moved around the scene twice, during which you were photographed by the hotel's surveillance. Besides, there was a witness to confirm this.” Chen Shi pointed to his nose with his thumb, “And that person is me! These two pieces of evidence are enough to form a chain of evidence, and there is also the ether. If we search in this hospital, we will find evidence of the mysterious disappearance of ether. Do you have anything else to say? Doctor Gao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gao Xiaohui felt as though someone had taken away her spine and slowly laid her back down into her chair. Her eyes kept darting back and forth. Lin Dongxue was ready to take out her handcuffs when Chen Shi made a gesture to stop her in her tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi was waiting quietly when Gao Xiaohui changed her personality suddenly as if she was a different person. She gritted her teeth and looked up, “That damn bitch deserved to die! She took my boyfriend away from me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi showed an expression of interest. He pulled a chair out, sat down, and asked, “Do you play the game too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Chen Jun and I met in the game, and we talked about anything and everything. Later, he proposed that we meet up. I never had the experience of meeting someone from the Internet, so I brought Gu Mengxing to meet him with me just in case. I’ll regret that decision to my death. The first time we met, Chen Jun arrived at the appointment on time. Gu Mengxing and I spied on him not far away. I was very satisfied with him and was preparing to go to the meeting, but Gu Mengxing, this bitch, suddenly told me that her stomach hurt her and dragged me away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“A few days later, I was prepared to make up my missed appointment. I re-appeared in the game to meet with Chen Jun, but he told me that he had already met me in person. At this time, I understood what was going on, and I confronted Gu Mengxing about it face to face. She lied at the beginning, but then she couldn't keep up the lie any longer and told me the truth. She chose Chen Jun as her target, pretended to be me, and lied by saying that she was my character. What boils my blood even more is that they even slept together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I just couldn’t believe that my BFF would steal my boyfriend. No. In fact, I should have known and thought it all along. She was the kind of bitch who couldn’t do without a man! I don’t want something that someone else has used before. I was angry at myself. From then on, I rarely contacted that bitch, but she often initiated contact with me. It was like she was purposely trying to test my patience, informing me how well they were getting along. I thought in my heart that a horrible wench like that would eventually get stabbed to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I thought this case was done after that. I didn't expect that a patient would come to see me just a few months ago. It turned out to be Chen Jun. He was infected with sexually transmitted diseases, and I just couldn’t believe it! I guessed that this must be related to that horrible wench. After some digging, it turned out my hunch was correct. While she was messing around outside, she got infected with STDs and transmitted them to Chen Jun. I didn’t know whether I should laugh or cry. Chen Jun is such a good man. Why was he taken away by this kind of bitch? And she didn’t even know how to cherish-”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When she got to that point, Gao Xiaohui put her head in her hands painfully while Chen Shi pressed, “So, that was the moment where you formulated the intention to kill her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Yes!” Gao Xiaohui agreed while still having her face buried in her hands, “The whole process was similar to your guess. I thought I planned it out very well. How are you able to read my plans so thoroughly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;“Did you think that your plan was foolproof? No, it was filled with many flaws!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I... Will I be sentenced to death? I don't want to die. Please let me go!” Gao Xiaohui started to cry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“That's not up to me to say. You need to pay the price for killing someone. When you made this decision, you should have expected such a result! I sympathize with your experience, but I don't agree with your actions. Killing someone is the most idiotic solution to a problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi stood up and waved to Lin Dongxue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Dongxue took a deep breath. She didn't expect the real murderer to be arrested; this was the first time in her life that she had handcuffed an actual murderer. The happiness in her heart was hard to put into words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As Lin Dongxue was walking over, prepared to handcuff Gao Xiaohui, the suspect suddenly shoved Lin Dongxue and grabbed a syringe from the drawer, intending to quickly stab herself in the leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi reacted quickly and stopped her with his hand, causing the syringe fell to the ground. A bitter smell and taste filled the room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi stared at Gao Xiaohui’s eyes and comforted her, “Listen, you may not be sentenced to death in this situation. If you fight hard, you still have a chance to see the sky again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gao Xiaohui cried and cried, “Even if I can see the sky again after a few decades, I will be an old lady at that time. My life is completely ruined. Ruined! I didn't even get to experience mutual love with someone even once...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As she said this, Gao Xiaohui burst into tears, and Chen Shi hugged her, gently patting her shoulders to comfort her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This scene made Lin Dongxue dumbfounded. Only after a long time did she realize that Chen Shi was gesturing for her to give him the handcuffs. Chen Shi took the handcuffs and put it on Gao Xiaohui. This time, she was very obedient. Chen Shi lectured, “Everyone must take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. This was your choice. Do not blame the heavens or anyone else. Moreover, if you really wanted to commit suicide, there are still plenty of opportunities in prison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Hey!” Lin Dongxue yelled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How could this guy say such irresponsible words?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi took a coat and covered Gao Xiaohui's hands, leaving her with a few strands of dignity. When she was ready to go, Gao Xiaohui asked, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“A driver who is a justice-enthusiast,” Chen Shi smiled and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The three got into the car, and &nbsp;Lin Dongxue was so excited that she almost couldn’t contain herself. Of course, while in the presence of the murder suspect, she couldn't thank him. At this time, Lin Qiupu called and queried, “Dongxue, where did you go? This morning, you didn’t sign-in with your punch-card. Did you act without authorization again? How many times have I talked about this? As a policeman-”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Brother, I caught the murder suspect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">On the other end of the phone, Lin Qiupu was stunned by Lin Dongxue's words to him. This was the same Lin Dongxue who never called him “brother” during working hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu asked, “You caught one again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“This time it’s the real suspect! You can rest assured, and there is evidence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Where are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I will be back soon. Be ready to interrogate them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu didn’t hang up for a long time. He finally cautioned, “Don't make any more mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Hanging up the phone, Chen Shi suddenly laughed, and Lin Dongxue asked, “What are you laughing at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“It’s funny thinking about what your brother’s expression would be like!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi then turned and asked Gao Xiaohui, “Doctor Gao, what is your last wish before going to the police station?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gao Xiaohui already looked like she had accepted her fate. She smiled a little and said, “I want to eat the mala</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"><span id="footnote-ref-6074"><a href="#footnote-6074">[2]</a></span></span> spicy soup at the Shou Wang Palace.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Oh, perfect. I was just thinking that I was hungry too. Let’s get going!” Chen Shi started the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Hey, don't make decisions without permission!” Lin Dongxue cried in a panic.</span></p>
