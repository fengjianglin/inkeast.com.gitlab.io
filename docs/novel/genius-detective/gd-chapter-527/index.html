 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing this, Lu Hao was so frightened that he broke out in cold sweat. He immediately plastered a smile on his face. "Yes, we met. She asked me to go out and eat that day. She vented to me at dinner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Which restaurant was it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Changlai Restaurant on Liuxi Road ..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you sure?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I remembered it wrong. It's Burger King."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you sure? Then, let's verify it now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no, no, it was a food stall."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi sneered. "There’s no security cameras at food stalls, so it’s convenient for your lie."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I didn't lie. Why should I lie?!" Lu Hao really wasn't good at lying. Although he said so, his expression was flustered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "Do you think we would be unprepared before we came to find you? Actually, we’ve visited her husband before we came to find you. We basically know what the relationship you two have with each other."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao kept touching his nose and his cheeks flushed. Chen Shi gave him a final blow. "Or, let's change places and sit down for a nice talk?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no!" Lu Hao finally admitted defeat. "I admit. I admit that I have that kind of relationship with her, but it's not the relationship you think. Our relationship is a little bit more of that kind."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What kind of relationship is it? Make it clear!" Lin Dongxue was a little impatient.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao smiled and said to Lin Dongxue, "Leave me a little face, okay? That is... We had an affair!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How long have you two been in this relationship?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Over a year now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How did you two get to know each other?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"She came to get her hair done and left her contact information down. I’m not as weird as you think. She took the initiative to seduce me. She said that her marriage was unhappy and her husband was trash in all aspects. She didn’t know why she blindly married him. I comforted her. At first, it was just verbal comfort. Later, it became physical comfort..." Lu Hao raised his eyebrows and smiled at Lin Dongxue. "Beauty, that isn’t illegal is it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why didn’t you tell the truth in the beginning?" Lin Dongxue said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I want to save some face too!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"So, you met on the 8</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Where did you meet?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"As usual, we found a bed, ordered take-out, had sex after eating, and then ate after sex. Then, we slept until the next day."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Address!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the other party's expressionless face, Lu Hao was smiling a little ashamedly. He retracted his smile and told them the address. It wasn’t a hotel there, but a cheap apartment near his workplace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao explained that it was his friend’s house. When the friend went abroad, he was safekeeping the keys and temporarily borrowed it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing this, Chen Shi thought that it was another clue that couldn’t be verified by physical evidence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He asked, "Can we go and have a visit?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There’s nothing to visit. It’s just a small broken house. Rest assured, there won’t be any corpses in it." Lu Hao tried to joke, but neither of the other two smiled. He scratched his head in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let's take a trip over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I... There are still guests in my house."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’ll accompany you to explain to the guests."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I haven't eaten yet."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’ll treat you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao couldn't produce another reason. He could only reluctantly agree. The three of them got into a taxi. Lin Dongxue sat in the front passenger seat and Chen Shi monitored Lu Hao from behind. He felt like this youngster wasn’t honest and might be the key to the case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue glanced at the time, thinking that it wasn’t good. The train was about to leave. So, she sent a text message to Chen Shi. "Do you want to postpone the ticket? We’re not going to make it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi replied, "I’m a little interested in this case right now. I won’t go back tonight."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, I’ll listen to you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi called Tao Yueyue and said that he wouldn’t be heading back tonight. Tao Yueyue didn’t react very much. "Then, I’ll go and stay with Sister Gu."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, be careful!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You guys should also be careful outside..." Then, she quickly added, "Take protective measures with Sister Lin!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You little devil!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, the three went to the residence of Lu Hao's friend and pushed the door into the house. Lin Dongxue covered her nose and asked, "Is this a place people can live in?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao smiled in embarrassment. "It’s a bit busy. My friend doesn't usually clean up. I'll get you a chair."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No need!" Lin Dongxue found that this guy was particularly attentive. At first, she wondered if he would be gay. Now, it seemed like he was just a lecherous person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some subconscious reactions couldn’t be acted out. Every action or gaze would reveal it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There wasn't even a bed in this house. There was only a Simmons mattress spread on the ground and there were faint sweat stains on it in the shape of a human. There were also take-out boxes, used condoms, and an ashtray next to it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi took a look at the cigarette butts in the ashtray. He remembered that Lin Hui had cigarettes of the same brand in her car. This should have been smoked by Lin Hui.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "Lin Hui's own house is very clean and tidy. How could she go to this pigsty and spend her night here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi made an "I don't know" gesture. He only knew that if it were Lin Dongxue, she’d be unwilling to undress in this kind of pigsty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao said with a grin, "Don’t look at the mess here. This is our little love nest. She comes here every week. We’re very happy together. She said that it’s like she’s recharging here. She can go back to face her life after recharging here."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Didn't you say that you have a girlfriend!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aiya, my girlfriend is too naïve. I still like mature young women like Lin Hui more... By the way, I also like women like elder sister here. Why did you become a criminal police officer?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue ignored him. "You two stayed here for two days?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, two days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Why did you call her on the night of the 10</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Her charger was left behind. Look, it’s this one..” Lu Hao picked up a power cable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi glanced at the five used condoms beside the “bed”. It should be about right for two days, unless this guy was particularly energetic. He asked, "Has Lin Hui mentioned to you about what’s happening with her family?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, she said she might get a divorce."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Because of you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no, she and I have a feeling of an older sister and younger brother getting together. Besides, I’m so young and I don't want to get married. We’ve never talked about that type of stuff. She got married mainly because of her husband. Her husband..." Lu Hao paused. "He’s particularly useless. He only knows how to play games all day long. The two of them were married because she thought her husband's family background wasn’t bad and that he was also quite interesting. When they got married, she found out that he’s a mama’s boy. He didn't care about anything and they often argued."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While listening, Chen Shi squatted down to check the feet of a cabinet. He stood up. "Did Lin Hui suddenly get rich lately?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, Lu Hao became nervous and then used a smile to cover it up. "Are you talking about her bonus? I heard that she performed outstandingly recently, and her work gave out 100,000 yuan to her as her bonus. She planned to travel with me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"All right, you can go back first!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Hao let out a big sigh of relief. This action made Chen Shi even more suspicious of him. When he went downstairs, Lu Hao took a taxi away. Chen said to Lin Dongxue, "There are signs of a dog chewing in the house. Lin Hui went home before coming here."</span></p>
