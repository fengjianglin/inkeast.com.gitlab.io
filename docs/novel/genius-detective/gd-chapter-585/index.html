 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><strong>Volume 39: Split Crime</strong></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>On October 19</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Chen Shi, Gu You, kk and Sun Zhen sat in the office. Everyone was called together because there was something important to talk about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Remember Yi Qing's case? The police found the company sponsoring the orphanage is Dahong Group from this city. The current chief and vice executive officers are twins named Qu Jing’an and Qu Jingli. A few years ago when the company didn’t belong to them, there were successive cases of mysterious disappearances of upper-level personnel from within the company. The Qu brothers took advantage of the low stock price to buy a large number of shares and became a major shareholder. They quickly took control of the Dahong Group. These past few years, they kept pushing aside their company’s veterans and purchasing shares in-house. They’re already firmly in the top spot."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gu You said, "These two names are very unfamiliar. They don’t seem like our ‘old friends.’ Do you suspect that Zhou Tiannan is secretly assisting them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The possibility is very high because it is the period when the serial killer under the pseudonym "Zhou Xiao" was most active. The police simply didn’t have enough personnel to investigate the case of the Dahong Group. Drawing attention to other things has always been Zhou Tiannan's specialty. The police are currently focusing the investigation on Dahong Group. Their suspicious activities are even more exaggerated. Captain Lin believes that Dahong Group may be supporting Zhou Tiannan behind the scenes, but they don’t have a clean background themselves. As a rapidly rising young company, they hid many shady activities. This provided the police with a reason to investigate them."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sun Zhen raised his hand. "Isn’t that too roundabout? In order to investigate Zhou Tiannan, why not just investigate him directly?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There’s no evidence. Please, the police are subject to the law and cannot investigate a citizen casually." kk said, "I say that I should just follow him whenever he goes out and then push him really hard onto the road all of a sudden. Then, all the troubles are solved. Why make it so bothersome?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "If we can't interrogate and sentence Zhou Tiannan, it doesn't have any meaning. He’s the spiritual leader of 'Black Honey', and he has many ruthless characters underneath him such as Ling Shuang. Also, we can't do anything to him right now. We can only slowly dig around him. If we make him fall down suddenly, the gang of evil people under him will go out of control."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's like a tumor. Hastily removing it would bring worse results," Gu You commented.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's so troublesome!" kk complained. "It's not me who’s saying this, but your justice methods are totally useless when dealing with this kind of scum. He’s unreasonable. All the ideas inside him are evil."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Last time I asked you to follow that teacher, did you find anything?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kk took a few photos from the drawer and threw them on the coffee table. Sun Zhen glanced at them. "This doesn’t capture anything!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Idiot!" kk smiled profoundly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The photos were taken of windows. Chen Shi carefully compared them and found that the position of a flower pot on the window had constantly been changing. He said, "This is the method of contact between Yan Ke and the mastermind?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Brother Chen is clever. I found this guy playing with this flower pot every day at home. I thought that it must be something shady. I really caught them!" kk pulled out a photo from his arms, like he was showing his trump card. He chucked it boldly on the table. "Look!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A side profile of a person was taken in the photo. That person was wearing a black sweater and sunglasses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gu You looked at it in her hands. "Xu Fa, a master of making and using drugs. He’s also one of Zhou Tiannan's loyal men."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Unfortunately, Ling Shuang wasn’t photographed. Even if she was, it’d be difficult to use as evidence." Chen Shi sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That case ended just like that?" kk asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Only on the day of Zhou Tiannan's arrest can we really convict Yan Ke. Not only Yan Ke, but also many people who’ve received Zhou Tiannan's 'benevolence'!" Chen Shi sighed when he wondered when that day would come.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So, what will Zhou Tiannan do next?" Gu You asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who knows?! But this time, the investigation of Dahong Group is an opportunity. kk and Little Worm, you two should continue to monitor Zhou Tiannan during this time. Don't let go of any of his actions. I want to know what his reaction is."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Roger that!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"By the way, has Zhou Tiannan still been getting prostitutes lately?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's still the same. His life is very 'routine'. There’s a woman going there every Wednesday."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke was now in the school monitoring the warehouse. This was a leisurely job. Because the students were unwilling to listen to him, the school had to throw him there temporarily in order to calm down the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sitting there holding a cup of tea every day, facing the room full of books, Yan Ke's mood was very complicated. Of course there was no possibility of promotion in this job. He held a grudge in his heart and felt that this society was unfair to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He said to Zhou Tiannan in private that he could do many things. In his eyes, Zhou Tiannan was a god. He was omnipotent, which made Yan Ke have complete admiration for him. He hoped that Zhou Tiannan could help him, even if his hands were stained with blood again, it would be fine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After experiencing the last incident, he was more open-minded. As long as he had a good life, it didn’t matter no matter who he sacrificed. The most important thing in this world was himself!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After the school bell rang, Yan Ke saw the students running out of the classroom from the window. The teachers walked out of the campus chatting with each other. Everything was so calm. Their world wasn’t affected at all without him in it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke sighed deeply and looked at his left hand wearing a plastic finger. When he looked up, he saw Zhou Tiannan standing on the playground and pointing in the direction of the parking lot. Yan Ke nodded desperately. He was very excited. Zhou Tiannan had a "mission" to arrange for him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waiting for most of the people to leave, Yan Ke ran to the parking lot. Zhou Tiannan sat in his car and was surrounded by smoke. He only said one sentence. "Go to the Red Island Café. There’s a man wearing a black hat by the window. "</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Teacher Zhou, is this the task for me? You’ve also seen my current situation. I have nothing to lose. I can do a lot of things to prove my worth to you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Tiannan smiled. "Can murder be done?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!" Yan Ke was excited. He wanted this kind. Only this could prove his value. He hoped that Zhou Tiannan would treat him as his own comrade.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Tiannan shook his head. "I promised not to let you get involved in danger. Rest assured, the things to be done this time are very safe. Don't let my friend wait."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke nodded with a smile on his face and retreated like a minion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He went to the cafe outside the school. A man in a black hat was drinking coffee casually by the window. The location was strategically planned so that it was impossible to eavesdrop around them. Yan Ke sat down and said, "Teacher Zhou asked me to come."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man looked him up and down. "Which school are you from?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My surname is Yan, I am a teacher... I used to be."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mr. Zhou loves to help others." The other party smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, he saved my life. I’m willing to do anything?" Yan Ke lowered his voice. "Do I need to transport drugs? Or commit murder? Or kidnapping? I’m mentally prepared. I can do anything, as long as it’s for Teacher Zhou!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other party glanced at him. "In this day and age, a sincere young man like you is rare."</span></p>
