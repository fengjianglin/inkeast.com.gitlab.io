 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Lin Dongxue thought for a while and said, "Lin Hui's husband, Li Xiang, also said before that she took the dog away on the evening of the 8</span><span>th</span><span>. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">he timeline sounds about right."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Of course, the dog is not the point. The point is the money. I'm sure the amount of over 10 million yuan is one hundred percent gained from unknown means and it’s directly related to the disappearance of Lin Hui. To find out about the source of the money, we have to investigate every place that she’s gone to before her disappearance..." Chen Shi pondered, "Lu Hao is definitely hiding something. He generously brought us to the place where he and Lin Hui cheated in, but he wouldn’t let us go inside his home. Would his house have any clues?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Should we go back and catch him by surprise?" Lin Dongxue asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Well, let's take a two-pronged approach. I'll go to Lu Hao's house. You go to Li Xiang's house to see who he meets and does after he gets off work.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"We need to monitor Li Xiang as well?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Of course. His house is also the place where Lin Hui went to. Would the money be from there? Anyway, we’ll need to figure it out!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, I'll see you later."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Be careful!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Along the way, Chen Shi was thinking about the whole incident. The money shouldn’t be Lin Hui’s. No one would put ten million yuan in cash in a sack and hide it in the boot of their car.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It’s very likely that the money was stolen or deceived from someone. The person who lost the money wouldn’t speak out and would only try to find it in secret.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The suspicions in the case made Chen Shi very excited, and he couldn't wait to know the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Arriving at Lu Hao's house, Chen Shi entered the building opposite it, stood in the corridor, and stared toward the opposite side from the window. Stake-outs were naturally boring. He would sit on the stairs for a bit, then stand up and walk around. The residents going up and down would look strangely at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After nightfall, the stairs were dark. Lin Qiupu called and asked about the situation there. He said that the case had been officially filed. He greeted Lieyang’s public security bureau and gave Chen Shi a deputy chief’s contact information so that he could ask them for help at any time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Then, Lin Dongxue sent a WeChat message with a red Chevrolet in it. Lin Dongxue said, "This car came to Li Xiang's house in the evening and the person has been in the house the entire time. The curtains have been closed. I don’t know what they’re doing inside. I can only see the light from the TV."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi was slightly surprised. This car was very similar to his own car.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He replied, "Is there a hotel nearby? Book it if there is and I’ll find you later."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue replied, "There is one that I’ll book later. After a day of running around, I stink of sweat. I’ll have to take a nice shower tonight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi looked up. Lu Hao still had his curtains pulled shut. At this time, the lights went out. Chen Shi intuitively judged that Lu Hao might have to go out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He hurried downstairs and hid under a tree within the housing district. After five minutes, Lu Hao came out carrying a big black bag. He kept looking around and walked straight to the entrance of the housing community. Chen Shi followed behind. At night, the housing area was only illuminated by the streetlights. There was a large area of darkness between the streetlights, which made it easy to hide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lu Hao went to the door of the housing district and suddenly backed away. He stepped on the grass and tossed the bag over before heading out the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi followed to see him find and pick up the bag he threw out, carry it for some time, and cross a few roads while sneakily glancing around the whole way. It was very suspicious. Chen Shi even wondered whose corpse it was in the bag.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Finally, Lu Hao stopped in front of a trash can and threw the bag in before turning around to leave. Chen Shi quickly hid under the stairs of an Internet cafe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After Lu Hao walked past, Chen Shi came out, dragged the bag out, and opened it. The contents inside made him too excited. It was a woman's wig, clothes, stockings, and high heels.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He photographed the contents of the bag and sent it to Lin Dongxue. "Unexpected find. Trash thrown out by Lu Hao."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Was the person you saw actually him?" Lin Dongxue speculated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi thought about it. In fact, he wasn’t too sure either. It was so late at that time. If the man in the car was really a disguised woman, he wouldn’t have been able to tell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In any case, this package was essential. He immediately called the local police and asked them to detain Lu Hao.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He texted Lin Dongxue, "We’ll see you at the Public Security Bureau of District xx."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lu Hao didn’t expect that the police would descend from the sky and arrest him. He struggled all the way and was taken down by the police. When he saw Chen Shi standing there, he was stunned. He said, "Officer Chen, what can’t you ask directly? Why do you have to do this? If my neighbors saw, it would be bad!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi raised the bag in his hand. "Some words, I'm afraid you won't say when asked face-to-face ... Besides, I'm not a policeman, but a consultant. They’re the police."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi gave the bag to the police officers, saying that he would arrive later. After the police car left, he went to find Lu Hao's door and opened the lock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After seeing the pigsty in the afternoon, and then looking at Lu Hao's messy little house, he actually felt like it was alright. This was a very ordinary place with leftover lunch on the table. The TV was still on and a variety show was being broadcasted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi checked around the place. When he went into the bathroom, he smelled a burnt smell. He opened the toilet and found that there was some black ash on the inner wall of the toilet, as if someone had burned something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He put on the rubber gloves he carried with him, reached into the toilet bowl to fish around, and actually pulled out a handful of ashes. From the amount, Lu Hao had burned a lot of paper. It would have weighed a kilogram at minimum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Although he didn’t know if anything could be tested, Chen Shi still collected the ash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Then, he saw a large sack in the kitchen, which was stuffed under the gas stove. When he opened it, there was the smell of paper from it, but it was definitely not the smell of money. The smell of money and paper were different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">Things are getting more and more interesting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He left and went to the public security bureau. Lin Dongxue had been waiting for a long time. She said, "Why have you only come now? You wouldn’t be trespassing in a private dwelling again, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The door wasn’t closed and a suspicious smell came out. Wouldn’t I naturally push the door in and have a look?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The door wasn’t closed?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi smiled. "I mean, to me, it’s like it wasn’t closed."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I really don’t know what to do with you!" Lin Dongxue smiled bitterly. "We aren’t in Long'an right now. Don't let the local colleagues know what you do."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Relax, I’ll be cautious... But this kid really is suspicious."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue and the local police communicated and they agreed to borrow the interrogation room for two people, after which they could take the interrogation records away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lu Hao was overthinking alone in the interrogation room. When he saw Lin Dongxue coming in, he lifted his handcuffs as if he was seeing a relative. “Elder sister, have you made a mistake? I haven't committed any crimes! Can you release me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Look at your attitude."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Aiya, why don’t you just ask what you want to ask? I’ll tell you everything I know. Please, I beg you, elder sister!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi sat down and slammed on the table. "Don’t sweet talk here. Lu Hao, sit down properly!"</span></p>
