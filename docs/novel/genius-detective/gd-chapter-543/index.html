 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Lu Baoqiang scratched his head, "The two of them came to China to act as evil officers here. They weren’t liked here, nor were they respected in their own country.&nbsp;</span><span>Tamura's friend once grabbed his collar and shouted at him,&nbsp;</span><span>‘Nandai konna mono iikai shinji&nbsp;</span><span>masuka</span><span>?!’"<span id="footnote-ref-ef7c"><a href="#footnote-ef7c">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After all, he was an actor. He acted very convincingly and amused the police officers present. Chen Shi asked, "What does that mean?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"It means, ‘Young fellow, why do you want to act in this kind of thing?!’"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Lu Baoqiang, your Japanese isn’t bad. I asked you what Fujiwara had said yesterday. Why didn't you tell me then?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Actually, I don't understand Japanese at all. This is what Old Wang had told me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Old Wang? Call him over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After a while, Old Wang came. When he saw all the police in the room, his expression was a little flustered, but it was only for a moment. He immediately recovered his smile, "You’re looking for me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I heard that your Japanese isn’t bad."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Wang waved his hands. "It's not good at all. I only know a few sentences. I learned them while filming.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi said to Lu Baoqiang. "Repeat the sentence from just now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lu Baoqiang said it again. "It took me so long to learn this sentence and I was taught by Old Wang. Bird language is really difficult to learn.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Wang was slightly startled. He seemed to have understood who had “sold him out”. Chen Shi said, “I don’t believe that you can say such a complete sentence without any Japanese foundation. It seems that your Japanese isn’t too bad?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Ahem, I know a little bit. I learned it while chatting with Japanese actors. I had learned this sentence from Tamura. I just learned the pronunciation."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What did Fujiwara say that day?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"He said..." Old Wang recalled. "Tamura's family is in a difficult position, and his wife is sick."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lu Baoqiang said, "Old Wang, I remember Fujiwara saying a lot that day!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You don't know this, but the Japanese are very verbose in their manner of speech. They can speak for half a day just saying one thing. Furthermore, my Japanese isn’t very good and I can only understand the gist of it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why didn't you say this yesterday? You only said this after an accident happened today!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What accident?" Old Wang suddenly seemed very nervous. At this time, Chen Shi deliberately talked about a flaw.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It has nothing to do with the case. Answer my question."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Old Wang licked his lips. "Officer, you’ve seen how it is. We all despise the Japanese. If I said that I could understand Japanese, they’d laugh at me. I’ve been working as a featured extra for ten years. I can be regarded as the most senior among all the extras, so I have to pay attention to my image.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That’s a good reason!" Chen Shi nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It isn’t an excuse. It’s a fact."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi looked around. "You two live here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yes, I share the rent with Baoqiang."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>There&nbsp;</span><span>was a bunk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;bed in the room with an iron frame. Chen Shi asked him who slept on the top bunk. Old Wang said that he slept on the top bunk himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>This answer was a bit different from what Chen Shi had expected. He was just a little&nbsp;</span><span>suspicious</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;of Old Wang, but if Old Wang slept on the upper bunk, it wasn’t too easy for him to enter and exit the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, I've finished asking!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qiupu gave Lu Baoqiang a lesson and everyone left while walking side by side. Lin Qiupu said, "I discovered a small detail in the morning. The deceased's clothes didn’t correspond to the ones they had used in the film. They were wearing the clothes of ordinary Japanese soldiers. Only the cap is an officer’s cap. In addition, cycle rickshaw tracks were found surrounding the scene. There are cycle rickshaws in the warehouse, one of which was used by the murderer to transport the corpses but it had been wiped clean."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It seems that the murderer had originally just wanted to take a cycle rickshaw to transport the bodies. He accidentally discovered the costumes, so the idea came up."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qiupu looked around at the historical buildings. "Don't look at how big it is here. Many areas are closed at night. The streets in the residential area have people walking around and some shops have security cameras. There aren’t many places for the murderer to choose from when abandoning the corpses."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Was anything discovered in the surveillance footage?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It's still under investigation. It’s been less than thirty hours since the case happened. How can it be so fast?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Help me investigate the victims. Especially Tamura’s bank account and the bank accounts of these featured extras."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What are you suspecting?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I suspect that Tamura was a scammer!" Chen Shi smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>On September 21</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">, at the case discussion meeting, Lin Qiupu revealed the new findings relating to the case. "Tamura’s bank account shows that his monthly income was nearly 40,000 yuan, and that he can save more than 30,000 after expenses were deducted. But every month, an extra 4,000 yuan was credited and converted to Japanese yen for remittance to a hospital in Japan... According to the information from Japan, his wife suffers from paraplegia and has been receiving treatment. The purpose of his work in China was to treat his wife."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What is his wife’s situation?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Her name is..." Lin Qiupu glanced at the document in his hand, "Tamura Yukari. Twenty-four years old this year. She was injured because of a car accident seven years ago. Tamura was a graduate of a film university and his salary was barely enough to make ends meet. After his wife became bed-ridden, he came to China to work as an actor and doubled his income to meet his wife’s medical expenses."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It seems that Tamura loved his wife very much, which was why he came to do a job where he’d be scolded by people.” Lin Dongxue said sentimentally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi sent a WeChat message to Tao Yueyue. "You were right. We’ll eat pizza tonight," and then said, "This extra four thousand yuan was probably the motive of the murderer. How much does it add up to?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"This extra income has been coming in since 2015. Sometimes there would be more, but it was never less than 4,000, which adds up to over 200,000!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The police present exclaimed at how persistent this "fooled" guy was. No wonder they’d be so ruthless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Qiupu added, "But as for those featured actors, their accounts weren’t abnormal."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Is there a list?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I will give it to you later on."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Chen Shi leaned back in his chair and pondered over it. "I think that people who have&nbsp;</span><span>known</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;Tamura since 2015 are very suspicious. We’ll use the rule of elimination!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After this round of elimination, there were only five people left. They had been acting together for many years. Among them was Old Wang.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">From the sample brought back that day, the blood stains in the alley were Tamura's blood, proving that the murderer had indeed killed Tamura first before secretly hiding and observing at the entrance of the alley. There were blood stains of two people in the alley.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As for the vomit, they couldn’t detect the DNA because the sample was too small. However, the traces left on the scene should have been made by a shovel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">In addition, several footprints were found at the scene. The shoe size was 40, and no matching shoes were found among the featured extras.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi was holding these documents in his hands. After thinking for a long time, he asked, "Lu Baoqiang was really drunk that day. Did he sleep in the dormitory? If so, he shouldn't know if Old Wang had gone out."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"You aren’t suspicious of Old Wang, are you...?" Lin Dongxue said, "Didn't the auntie from the kiosk downstairs say that she didn't see them go downstairs that night?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Is the auntie's testimony reliable? Let's go and check it out at night!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi took out his mobile phone and sent another WeChat message to Tao Yueyue. "Sorry, we’ll have to postpone the pizza to tomorrow!"</span></p>
