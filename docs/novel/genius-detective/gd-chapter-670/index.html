 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue went to Chengxing Company to investigate once again. The manager was extremely annoyed after being disturbed over the past two days. The police randomly came up with a hypothesis that part or all of Dong Xiao's body was still left on Earth. They had a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He really wanted to directly tell the police that this assumption was not true because he handled the project and Dong Xiao's body was sent to the skies above.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, he couldn't say such a thing. In the face of Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue's questions, he could only answer perfunctorily or prevaricate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While they were talking, there was suddenly a deafening gunshot outside. Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue exchanged gazes in astonishment. The gunshots rang three more times. Looking out from the door of the manager's office that was left ajar, they saw that an employee had been gunned down. There was a bloody mist on his chest as he knocked over a table with a crash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue immediately drew her gun, kicked the door and pointed it outside yelling, "Police! Put the gun down!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Lu Qi who rushed in with a gun to kill. He had shot and wounded three employees of Chengxing Company. Hearing Lin Dongxue's shout, instead of giving up, he adjusted the tip of his muzzle and shot twice at her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue retreated immediately in fright. One of the bullets shot through the wooden door, leaving a bullet hole in the side wall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He seems to have gone crazy..." Lin Dongxue said, dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Flee first!" Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing that the situation wasn’t good, the manager had already slipped away from the side door first, and the two also moved to the secretary's office next to them. The two offices were connected and both could be entered from the corridor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi kicked the door and rushed in. He shot two shots and blew up the computer on the table. He shouted, "Police, aren't you guys very arrogant? Why are you suddenly turning into a tortoise with your head inside your shell?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi had already dialed Lin Qiupu's number. He directly raised his cell phone and asked Lin Qiupu to listen to the scene. It was more intuitive than describing the situation in panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What he didn't understand was why Lu Qi suddenly came to kill people with a gun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi only had one weakness and that was Su Chan. Could it be that something happened between them?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Save yourself. Don't try and fight head-on. We'll be right there!" Lin Qiupu said loudly over the phone. When he heard Lin Dongxue's life was in danger, he was immediately in a rush.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi stopped slyly, held the front door of the manager's office, and stared at the corridor at the same time, so that no matter which door they came out of, he could see them and shoot instantly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Time passed by, and the two sides stood in a stalemate across a wall. Chen Shi shoved the manager with his arm and whispered, "Talk to him. Stall for time. The police will be here soon."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Talk about what?" The manager was crying and looked like death itself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Improvise."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager took a few deep breaths before he calmed down. He said tremblingly, "Mr. Lu, we’ve been working together very smoothly. Why would you do such a thing? Can you give me an explanation?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You lied to me!" Lu Qi shouted angrily. "Why didn't the entire corpse get launched? I gave you guys so much money."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager looked up and closed his eyes before he glanced at Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue. He wondered whether Director Lu went crazy. He talked about the incident directly in front of the police.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since the other party exposed the truth, he had nothing more to worry about, so he answered straightforwardly, "Why would we lie to you? The whole corpse was launched and not even so much as a hair was left behind. Otherwise, the police would have discovered it long ago."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No! I saw a video. You clearly lied to me!" Lu Qi yelled and knocked something down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bloody smell of the employees who had been shot began to fill the air, making the atmosphere even more eerie and terrifying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager was speechless and Chen Shi shouted, "Lu Qi, are you crazy? You blatantly came and killed people. Even if we can’t prosecute you for the matter regarding Dong Xiao, do you think you can get away with what you did today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Prosecute your mother!" Lu Qi roared. "I don't care about anything. I will kill all the people who deceived me and all the police!" Although he couldn’t see him, Chen Shi could imagine his expression as he said this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue was so frightened that her hands and feet grew cold. She held Chen Shi's hands tightly. Chen Shi's big, generous hands gave her some comfort. He whispered, "Don't be afraid. I will protect you. Give me your gun."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No! No!" Lin Dongxue shook her head. On one hand, police guns couldn’t be given out. On the other hand, she was afraid that Chen Shi would take risks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haven’t you always wanted to know about my past?" Chen Shi mustered up the courage and prepared to tell the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue looked at him in surprise, but then there was a commotion outside. They all thought it was reinforcements arriving. The people who came in shouted, "Fuck, he really has a gun!", "Hurry and call the police!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It turned out to be two security guards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi fired a shot at the door, but there was only the sound of the trigger being pulled with no gunshot. His bullets were all used up. Chen Shi took advantage of this opportunity to grab Lin Dongxue's gun without saying a word, rushing into the corridor, holding both hands flat and aiming at Lu Qi.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi was angrily changing the magazine. Seeing Chen Shi rush out, he threw the pistol over to hit him as if it was a projectile. The corridor was already narrow and the gun was coming at him aggressively. Chen Shi flashed to the side when he saw that Lu Qi had strode forward speedily. He wanted to grab the police gun.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this time, the two sides were already too close to each other and it was too late for Chen Shi to shoot. Even if he fired, he wasn’t sure that he would be deprived of his mobility. So, he threw the gun at Lin Dongxue inside the door and shouted, "Catch!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi let out a roar like a beast, rushed forward and punched Chen Shi. Although Chen Shi blocked it with both hands, he still took the punch firmly and was forced to slide over two meters away. This strength was truly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi slammed open the secretary's office door and rushed towards Lin Dongxue. Lin Dongxue stepped back and fired. All three shots hit Lu Qi's shoulder and leg. After being shot, he just shook slightly and his expression became more fierce. Then, he picked up a sofa chair with one hand and threw it at Lin Dongxue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue hurriedly backed away in fright. The sofa slot into the door perfectly. Then, the manager's cries came from the secretary's office. "Let me go... let me go... Ah!!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the end of the cry, it became a heart-piercing scream. When Chen Shi rushed in, he saw an unforgettable scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The tall and burly Lu Qi held the manager's legs upside down and tore them in two directions. With a snap, he tore off one of the manager's legs and the large pieces of flesh around his waist. Blood splashed all over the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He turned his face sullenly with a twisted smile on the corner of his mouth, like a demon immersed in the pleasure of killing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi felt a deep fear run through him. This kind of opponent could not be defeated. He turned and ran. Lu Qi quickly chased after him. At the same time, Lin Dongxue rushed out of the manager’s office and fired several shots at Lu Qi from behind until the bullets were used up.</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span>Lu Qi received three more shots in the back, which completely angered him. He turned his head around furiously, staring at her with a pair of red eyes, and rushed towards Lin Dongxue...<span id="footnote-ref-f686"><a href="#footnote-f686">[1]</a></span></span></p>
