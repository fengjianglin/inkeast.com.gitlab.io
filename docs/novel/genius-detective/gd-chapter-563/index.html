 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Xiang took Chen Shi downstairs and went to another unit in a different apartment building. The apartment was too clean and tidy, even lacking in human presence. Chen Shi often cooked and ccould feel it when he walked into the house. The owner of this house must not usually cook.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You live here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This is also my aunt's house. Strictly speaking, it is my younger cousin’s. Because I work in Long'an, my aunt rented the house to me. When my cousin comes back from studying abroad, I will move out... Do you smoke?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, thanks! Did your aunt's funeral already take place?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's done. She’s already buried and resting in peace. It's really a tragedy that this happened." Li Xiang shook his head with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Did the police not recommend an autopsy?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They told me that if we needed an autopsy, we could go to the medical university to do it ourselves. The cost was over 20,000. My cousin and I discussed it. This wasn’t a criminal case. Besides, she was already dead. Getting it messed and broken by a forensic doctor wouldn’t be very good, so we didn’t do the autopsy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi pointed to his cheek and asked, "Did you get burnt?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, you don’t know what the fire was like. The whole building was smoking. I ran up and opened the door, and the fire burst out. Not only did I burn my face, half of my body was burnt… The only comfort is that the firefighter said my aunt didn’t pass away painfully. She may have been poisoned by the gas first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi nodded. For some reason, he felt Li Xiang was too calm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, with only this point, he wasn’t to be suspected. Real life isn’t acting where everything you say is full of emotion. Many people speak monotonously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi looked around and Li Xiang followed behind. When he walked into the bedroom, Chen Shi smelled some odors and asked, "Has this house been cleaned recently?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, my cousin is planning to come back for the New Year, and my work contract is coming to an end soon. I’m ready to move out. I took a few days off because of the fire and cleaned up at home."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is your occupation?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Management of a company."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Leave your contact details!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After taking down Li Xiang's basic information, Li Xiang asked, "Are the police at the public security bureau planning to re-open the case for investigation? Was my aunt killed? But when the local police station investigated it, she didn’t have any enemies."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi smiled slightly. "This is temporarily confidential. I'll be taking my leave."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Safe travels. I won’t see you off."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Walking out of this apartment, Chen Shi stood far away and watched from under a tree. Li Xiang didn't do anything abnormal. He just sat down to drink water and play with his mobile phone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue checked several unit buildings and waited at the place where Chen Shi stopped his car. Suddenly, a stone was thrown and hit her back. She turned her head and looked around. A boy in a sports jacket walked over with his hands in his pockets and said disdainfully, "Haha, Stinking Yueyue is actually working to make money. Your family must be very poor. I will tell everyone tomorrow when I arrive in the class!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue furrowed her brows in disgust. The boy was Liang Zuoming. The boy whose leg she designed to break a year ago. After he recovered, he often looked for trouble. Tao Yueyue also made some small plans to let him taste a few losses, but he still persevered. Looking at him was as disgusting as swallowing a fly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Liang Zuoming went over and studied Tao Yueyue's uniform as if he was very interested. "What are you selling?! How much have you sold? Is it enough for you to eat tomorrow? Do you want me to give you two yuan?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don’t want to talk to you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Tch, the most stinking bitch in the class. Don't think I don't know what you’ve been doing in private!" Liang Zuoming grabbed the bag in Tao Yueyue's hand and took out a box of toothpaste from inside. "Haha, you’re actually selling this kind of stuff? You can tell it’s fake at a glance!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue gritted her teeth secretly. Her heart was beating wildly, looking at the stones beside the road and thinking about whether to go head-on with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other party was a strong and tall boy and she’d definitely suffer from going head-on with him. However, she couldn't swallow down the anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She clenched her fists to restrain the violent impulse in her heart. She didn't even notice that Chen Shi passed through the lawn path, grabbed Liang Zuoming's collar, grabbed the bag from him, and shouted, "Little bastard, what are you doing? Bullying my Yueyue?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Liang Zuoming widened his eyes and he was a little timid in the face of the grown-up. However, he still stuck his neck out and insisted, "Tao Yueyue came out to work and violated the school rules. I’ll tell the teacher tomorrow."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go ahead. Hurry and get lost before I beat you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Stinking uncle, my dad is here. Let him beat you, hahaha... Dad, someone bullied me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A black Mercedes-Benz from the community stopped suddenly. A big man got off from the car and came over with glaring eyes as he shouted, "Who dares to bully my son? I’ll kill him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he walked in front of them and looked at Chen Shi and Tao Yueyue, the big man froze for a moment. Liang Zuoming took the opportunity to complain, "Dad, Stinking Yueyue and her father bullied me. I didn't do anything and he wanted to hit me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Look at how your child is educated. Lying like he’s just drinking water. Yueyue, what did he just do to you?" Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Humiliated me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go and fuck yourself!" The big man said. "I know you two. She broke my son's leg last year. Damn, what do you still want to do to my son? Are you looking for a beating?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi looked at his words and manners and knew that he was a vulgar person. No wonder his son became a bully in the class. He said slowly, "Don’t talk about the past, alright? I lost a lot of money last year. We’re talking about today’s business. Don’t drag other things into this."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The big man sneered and pointed at Chen Shi. "A taxi driver. Why are you being so arrogant? I don't care what your reason is. Nobody in the world can lay a single finger on my son. Apologize to my son!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Liang Zuoming hid behind the big man and said, "Stinking Yueyue, apologize!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yueyue, you don’t have to reason with these sorts of people. They’re animals that haven't evolved completely and only recognize their fists but not their rationality," Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, are you itching for a fight? You haven’t researched what I, Liang, does for a living?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi clenched his fists. "You can still take your son and get lost right now. Then, your last dignity as a father won’t be lost."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re even fucking talking like that. I don't think you want to live!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't stand there and boast pretentiousness. I can’t be bothered talking nonsense with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The big man was still acting that way. In the tone of educating his son, he said, "See here? This kind of person doesn’t know what he can handle. He doesn’t remember his abilities and dared to challenge me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Liang Zuoming urged, "Dad, beat him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Beat him? I'm afraid this hangman would say I bullied him..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you done?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi turned around to the side of the big man and kicked at the face of the big man with thunderous force. He stopped right before he made contact. The big man stared blankly at the patterns on Chen Shi’s sole and swallowed hard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi put his foot down and stretched out a finger, his face sullen as he warned, "If your mouth doesn’t get cleaner, I will leave you in bed for three months!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It took awhile for the dazed big man to retrieve his soul. He led his son to escape and turned back as he was walking away to leave behind a cliché phrase. "Okay, just you wait! Wait for me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After sending away the pair of gods of plague, Tao Yueyue embraced Chen Shi's arms with excitement. kk also came out from behind a tree with applause and gave a thumbs up. "Brother Chen is so powerful!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Have you been watching the whole time?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can't help you anyway, so I became the audience!" kk said shamelessly.</span></p>
