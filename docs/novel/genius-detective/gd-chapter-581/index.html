 <p style="text-align: left"><span>On October 12</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Yan Ke was formally summoned. He sat in the interrogation room, &nbsp;sweating nervously, but in the face of any question, he only uttered only one sentence, "I won't say anything before the lawyer comes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Later, a lawyer arrived at the Public Security Bureau and introduced himself. "I’m Lawyer Wang Chengda of Chengda Law Firm, and Mr. Yan has entrusted me to act as his attorney."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After entering the interrogation room, Lawyer Wang whispered a few words in Yan Ke’s ear. This time, the interrogation was carried out by Lin Qiupu and another interrogator. Chen Shi, Lin Dongxue and other police officers stood outside watching.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After asking for the basic information, Lin Qiupu said, "Suspect, where were you around 6:00PM on September 30</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and what did you do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The lawyer replied on his behalf, "We have no obligation to answer this. Various clues now prove that the deceased was killed on October 1</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, and on this day, my client has a clear-cut alibi..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"However at present, the police&nbsp;</span><span>have</span><span>&nbsp;a testimony that on the evening of September 30</span><span>th</span><span>, you had a violent quarrel with the deceased, and then you took action." Lin Qiupu took out two bloodstain identification reports. "We found the blood of the deceased in two places within the office. Neither you nor the deceased have the key to that office. The blood could only have been left behind on September 30</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The lawyer said, "Mr. Police Officer, on the morning of October 1</span><span>st</span><span>, Mr. Liu, the colleague of the deceased, was working in that office and witnessed the deceased. Do you want to say that the deceased was killed on September 30</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;and resurrected on October 1</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!" Yan Ke nodded, with his eyes full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Everyone had discussed the strategy of this interrogation in advance. The other party would definitely try to lead the topic to the three witness testimonies. This was a trap, so Lin Qiupu avoided answering. He emphasized, "I’m asking the questions right now, not you. What were you doing on the evening of September 30</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke spread out his hands, "We had a fight."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who was quarreling with whom?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I quarreled with Lin Xiaoxiao."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Yan Ke explained the process in detail, Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi outside, "That lawyer is very slick. One witness testimony versus three witness testimonies. I wonder if Captain Lin can handle it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "The most terrible thing is that the three eyewitness testimonies created the chain of evidence. However, we have photos, which is iron-clad physical evidence. It can only be said to be fifty-fifty."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu continued to ask, "According to the testimony of the security guard on duty that day, it was you and your colleague Zhou Tiannan who left the school last, but he didn’t see the victim. How did she leave the school?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke said, "That’s obvious. She left in my car."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But this wasn’t captured on the surveillance camera. In fact, the surveillance monitoring that day had been tampered with. We analyzed the data and found that the footage had been replaced with the one from the previous day through software processing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke panicked for a moment and whispered to the lawyer. Chen Shi secretly praised, "Your brother has some skill. He used evidence that’s not to our favor to counter-attack and force him into a corner."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer replied, "My client is completely unaware of the incident regarding the surveillance footage. This may just be a coincidence."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Don't you think that it's too much of a&nbsp;</span><span>coincidence</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? It just happened to be the surveillance footage for that day. In fact, your so-called three eyewitness testimonies have no physical evidence to support them. Although Lin Xiaoxiao’s fingerprints were on the foot washing machine’s packaging, the amount of oil secreted was much lower than that of ordinary people, and the fingerprint distribution wasn’t natural. We have reason to believe that the fingerprints are fake. If it was her, why should she fake her own fingerprints?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The lawyer said, "There are many explanations for low oil secretion. For example, the girl may have applied hand cream, or she had been&nbsp;</span><span>using</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;chalk for a long time, blocking the pores."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Whether you’re pretending to not understand or you really don't understand, you can look at this appraisal report yourself."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer didn’t pick it up. He crossed his arms and said, “But you also can’t prove that the eyewitness testimonies are fake. Could the biological father of the deceased lie? If the three eyewitness testimonies are all fake, can I also suspect that the eyewitness testimony you have is also fake?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Qiupu sneered. The other party had finally&nbsp;</span><span>taken</span><span>&nbsp;the initiative to ask this question. He said, "This witness had&nbsp;</span><span>taken</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a picture! Mr. Yan, you were in the picture and so was Teacher Lin. You were on the sports field at the time!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke's eyes widened and he gulped nervously. The lawyer said aloud, "Please take out this evidence, otherwise, I think you’re extracting a confession by deceit!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu handed the enlarged photo to the lawyer. The photo had already been technically processed and the photo was clearer and brighter. A person with the same build as Yan Ke had been photographed carrying a long sack through the playground. Red liquid seeped through one end of the sack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the profile had been photographed, the face wasn’t clear, even with &nbsp;pixel sharpening. Yan Ke should thank his parents for this as his profile had no obvious features such as moles or birthmarks, and his ear shape was also normal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke’s sweat was falling like rain and his hands were shaking. The lawyer whispered to comfort him, "Don't be afraid!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Qiupu took the opportunity to add another&nbsp;</span><span>stab</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, "This is only one piece of the evidence we have. I want to ask you, what did you carry through the sports field that night?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I..." Yan Ke seemed like he would faint at any moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer interrupted loudly, "Wait a minute, how can this photo prove that it was my client?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Qiupu looked at&nbsp;</span><span>Yan Ke's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;eyes. "You are a teacher. There were hundreds of students that day who can prove that you were wearing these clothes. Your height and build are exactly the same. Mr. Yan, please explain this!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer continued to give tit-for-tat, "Even so, it proves nothing. I can even suspect that this picture had been photoshopped by someone for the sake of creating a sensation!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We have verified that the photos are real."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That person may not have been the real one. Anyone can wear this outfit. This kind of figure is very common among young men, and you had also said that the surveillance footage from that day was gone. This is uncorroborated evidence. It’s meaningless! "</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing this, Yan Ke rekindled his confidence, and Lin Dongxue said angrily, "This lawyer is simply too annoying. Such evidence would normally have pried the suspect's mouth open already!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Have some confidence in your brother. The confrontation isn’t over yet!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu said, "This photo was taken by the eyewitness and can prove his testimony. According to the security guard’s testimony, there were only four people in the school at that time. You, Zhou Tiannan, Lin Xiaoxiao and this witness. From this photo’s distance, first of all we’ll exclude the eyewitness. Zhou Tiannan’s figure doesn’t match this. It is even more impossible for it to be Lin Xiaoxiao. Then who was the person in the photo, and what was he carrying?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer said, "We will not answer without further evidence."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yan Ke summoned up his confidence again, "Yes, come up with further evidence! You don't have any at all!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu gritted his teeth angrily. He announced that the interrogation was temporarily suspended, went outside and said to Chen Shi, "Bring that child over to identify him on the spot! Let’s see how stubborn he can stay.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "Don't be too anxious. We still have 24 hours to detain him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer went into the corridor, dialed a number, and whispered, "Mr. Zhou, there is an eyewitness who may be a student... We can still barely handle it, but if he’s identified, it will be troublesome."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was momentary silence over the phone before he said, "If you can stall for time, I’ll get it sorted out!"</span></p>
