 <p>In the interrogation room, Ji Chunma ate a large boxed lunch and explained his crimes in fives and tens<span id="footnote-ref-c030"><a href="#footnote-c030">[1]</a></span>.</p>
 <p>He was originally a rich second generation, but his family suddenly went bankrupt. One day, his father drank too much and cut his arteries with a small knife. He then sat in the only luxury car that hadn’t been confiscated by the bank and raced the car around for around ten kilometers. He had wanted to see if he would die from blood loss or from a car crash first. Ji Chunma didn't even know how his father died in the end, but he hated his father for putting on a show and messing up the only luxury car he could have used to pick up girls.</p>
 <p>He had nothing left except for the stinking problem of spending money. It was impossible to work. It would be impossible to work in this life.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he could only rely on his friends to help him. The people he was closest to were the Lu family’s brothers, particularly the second son. The second son was known as the Lord Meng Chang<span id="footnote-ref-0c41"><a href="#footnote-0c41">[2]</a></span> of Long’an City, who made lots of friends and had a magnificent personality. Although he was infamous for being a spoiled brat, both men and women loved him.</p>
 <p>The second son of the Lu family once said that he didn't care that his friends were poorer than him. No matter how rich they were, they were poor compared to him anyway.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma acted like a bootlicker, eating and drinking with the second son all day long. Later on, Lu Zhendong sought him out in hopes that Ji Chunma would do something for him. Yes, Lu Zhendong asked him to play Infernal Affairs<span id="footnote-ref-0f12"><a href="#footnote-0f12">[3]</a></span> and report back on his brother’s affairs.</p>
 <p>Relying on these small reports, Ji Chunma received a considerable income. Later, Lu Zhendong's conditions increased. He was asked to betray Lu Zhenjie and call the paparazzi and reporters whenever Lu Zhenjie was playing around with female celebrities or when he drove into someone with his car. When he impulsively decided to dive into the realm of rock and roll, Ji Chunma was instructed by Lu Zhendong to hide a pack of heroin in the hotel where Lu Zhenjie lived and then call the police.</p>
 <p>However, no matter how much he worked against him, the second son had all of his father’s never-ending love for him and him alone.</p>
 <p>However, drug-use was a bit out of line. Old Man Lu was afraid that his baby boy would stray on the wrong path, so he banned his son from playing with bands and sent him to a drug rehabilitation center to control his finances.</p>
 <p>In those few months, the second son had no money to spend. He was so anxious that he didn’t know what to do with himself. That was when he came up with the idea of kidnapping. He persuaded several friends around him to participate, including Ji Chunma. The second son vowed to ensure that even if they were exposed by the police, he would tell them that it was not really a kidnapping. He would protect them all if that were to happen.</p>
 <p>Everyone started this farce for money. At this time, Lu Zhendong contacted Ji Chunma and instructed him to do something for him.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma was frightened. He used to only create trouble in secret. Now, Lu Zhendong actually told him to kill the younger brother and turn the fake kidnapping into a real one. However, he still succumbed to the heavenly price offered by Lu Zhendong.</p>
 <p>After all, Ji Chunma’s limbs weren’t diligent<span id="footnote-ref-18c2"><a href="#footnote-18c2">[4]</a></span> and was always lacking money.</p>
 <p>The plan went smoothly. Lu Zhendong also participated in the murder at the time. The tools were brought by him. During the process of killing those involved, because one of the victims was struggling, a drop of Lu Zhendong's blood fell on the ransom money.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma took and hid the money as evidence to threaten Lu Zhendong in the future.</p>
 <p>Of course, the six million ransom couldn’t be spent because Lu Zhendong overheard the police’s conversation. Hundreds of marked banknotes were hidden amongst the ransom money. All the money was burned, except for the bill in Ji Chunma's hands, which he kept as key evidence.</p>
 <p>They thought that things were just going to blow over, but they didn’t expect that there would be a powerful foe in the police who worked out the whole thing and suddenly suspected Ji Chunma. On the day the police car came to arrest him, Ji Chunma jumped out of the window to escape. He ran for more than ten miles with the help of God-given adrenaline and fled to the suburbs.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma was very resentful during the bitter days of hiding in the suburbs. He wondered how Lu Zhendong made it seem like his sleeves were empty<span id="footnote-ref-2c08"><a href="#footnote-2c08">[5]</a></span>. Thus, he called Lu Zhendong and said that he had a specially marked banknote stained with his blood. If he had nowhere left to go, he would turn himself in and bring Lu Zhendong down with him. The blood on the note couldn’t be explained away.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhendong could only pay him money, help him prepare fake documents, vehicles, and provide some material assistance.</p>
 <p>Although he had a rough time being a fugitive, he was happy that he received money. Ji Chunma had never been too far away from Long'an City. He wandered around the surrounding suburbs and occasionally returned to try his hometown snacks.</p>
 <p>Gradually, it seemed that things were blowing over and the police weren’t out to arrest him as earnestly. He found a lover and continued to blackmail Lu Zhendong while buying property and saving money using the name of his lover.</p>
 <p>Later, he found another mistress. Wang Xifeng as the “main wife” was very unhappy, but she couldn’t fend herself from his beatings, so she finally agreed to live together.</p>
 <p>Whenever Ji Chunma returned, he would find both mistresses were happy and cheerful. In fact, he knew that these two women were very dishonest behind his back, but it didn’t matter. It was a financial transaction to begin with and he was very rich!</p>
 <p>After running for five years, he worked out a set of rules, and knew when the police were vigilant and when they were loose with their investigations. He’d return when the coast was clear and he’d hide out in the countryside while things were hectic.</p>
 <p>Some time ago, he saw Lu Zhendong had been killed in the news. He was both shocked and relieved. This dangerous extortion relationship was finally over. The money he had on hand should be enough for him to live for a long time. He planned to return to Long'an. After destroying that banknote, he’d be able to live at home in the future with two women accompanying him.</p>
 <p>What he didn’t expect upon his return was for Wang Xifeng to tell him that the antique holding the banknote was accidentally broken. Ji Chunma widened his eyes and asked, "What about the money inside?"</p>
 <p>Wang Xifeng said, "You mean the dirty one hundred yuan? I deposited it in the ATM."</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma was extremely angry, but he went to the ATM to try and withdraw the money. He couldn't find it. He knew it was all over for him. Then again, it might not be over, since he was an expert in escaping now.</p>
 <p>The police would find Wang Xifeng through the money and Wang Xifeng knew too much about him. Wang Xifeng must die!</p>
 <p>As for the second mistress, Qiuping, he couldn’t let her live either. He could only say that she was unlucky.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma went home with a stern face and Wang Xifeng didn’t know she was about to die. She kept asking, “What’s wrong? Are you okay? Why won’t you talk?!”</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma grabbed Qiuping and kept having sex with her over and over again. After all, he hadn't touched a woman during this whole time. He was afraid he wouldn’t be able to do so for a long time after this. Why didn’t he find Wang Xifeng to have sex with? First, Qiuping was younger and more beautiful. Second, he was afraid that his anger would burst and he would end up killing Wang Xifeng before he could get anything done.</p>
 <p>After pleasuring himself, Ji Chunma grabbed a fruit knife and cut Qiuping's throat. When he went out of the room, Wang Xifeng saw the blood on his body and screamed before trying to escape.</p>
 <p>Ji Chunma stabbed her from the back with the knife. After she fell to the ground, he repeatedly stabbed her and vented his anger. This was the woman who ruined the possibility of his new start in life.</p>
 <p>After killing them, Ji Chunma was a bit hungry and went to the kitchen to find food. This woman really didn’t know how to take care of the place. There was nothing to eat in the kitchen. The refrigerator was full of fucking face masks. He saw a bag of dried goods on the ground and found a bag of noodles in the cabinet, but there wasn’t any meat around.</p>
 <p>From a young age, he was someone who didn’t like anything without meat.</p>
 <p>After thinking about it for a while, Qiuping's young and tender meat seemed quite good. He went into the bedroom and cut a piece of meat off her leg, then cut it up into shreds. He made a bowl of aromatic preserved vegetable and meat noodles.</p>
 <p>After filling himself up, he began to implement his perfect escape plan. If it weren’t for the police freezing Wang Xifeng's credit card, or Lu Zhendong's death that cut off his financial resources, or the asshole driver that recognized him...</p>
 <p>"You wouldn’t have been able to catch me if they didn’t die!" Ji Chunma sneered at the end of his confession.</p>
