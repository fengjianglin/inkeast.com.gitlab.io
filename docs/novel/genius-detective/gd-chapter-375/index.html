 <p>Chen Shi drove Tao Yueyue home. Lin Dongxue woke up when he reached home, rubbing her eyes and saying, "Huh? You also picked up Yueyue in passing?"</p>
 <p>"Did you sleep well?"</p>
 <p>"I feel more energetic now." Lin Dongxue stretched her neck. "It’s tiring to solve one case after another.”</p>
 <p>"Why don’t you have dinner at my house tonight?"</p>
 <p>"What useless words. What else were you going to do? Drive me away?"</p>
 <p>Going upstairs, Lin Dongxue looked at the door next to theirs and asked, "Miss Gu lives here?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pointed to the opposite door. "That's her home. You want to visit her?"</p>
 <p>"What would I say to her?"</p>
 <p>While they were talking, Gu You happened to go upstairs, and greeted Lin, "Officer Lin, I haven't seen you for a long time. Why are you here today?"</p>
 <p>"Just eating dinner at Old Chen's house before leaving."</p>
 <p>"You haven't been to my house before. Would you like to come in and sit down?" Gu You opened the door and said, "Come in!"</p>
 <p>All four of them went in. Tao Yueyue was already familiar with the place. She went to the refrigerator to get a drink by herself. Lin Dongxue looked around the house and said, "Did you buy this place?"</p>
 <p>"I bought it less than a year ago."</p>
 <p>"Haii, look at us who work as police officers. I’m still renting right now. You’re about the same age as me, but you already have your own home with two rooms and a living room.”</p>
 <p>"Officer Lin, I should be older than you."</p>
 <p>"Really? I can’t tell at all. Your skin is well maintained."</p>
 <p>"You flatter me. Officer Lin should be fond of sports, right?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought that women were really strange creatures. Lin Dongxue clearly said before that she didn't like Gu You very much, but the first time she dropped by her home, she actually spoke with Gu You so happily.</p>
 <p>Gu You took Lin Dongxue around the house, then politely saw them out the door. As soon as the door closed, Lin Dongxue grabbed Chen Shi's arm and asked, "Do you often come over and chat with this beautiful female neighbor?"</p>
 <p>"Are you jealous? Don't you know Gu You is dating Old Peng?"</p>
 <p>"Are they? I'll ask him right now!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue took out her mobile phone to send a message, then raised her mobile phone and said, "Captain Peng denied it."</p>
 <p>"You don't know what Old Peng is like by now?"</p>
 <p>"I don't believe it. I’ll ask Yueyue... Yueyue, does Uncle Chen often spend time with Miss Gu?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was afraid that the little thief would stab him in the back and said, "Only speak the truth. Just like how I’ll take you to eat pizza on the weekend when I promise you pizza. You need to speak the honest truth rather than make up nonsense!”</p>
 <p>"You think I can’t read between the lines? You’re openly bribing her!" Lin Dongxue twisted Chen Shi's ear.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue said, "To be honest, Uncle Chen and Sister Gu rarely interact with each other."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue still didn't believe it. Chen Shi said, "How about this? I’ll invite you to eat seafood. It’ll definitely taste even better because of your vinegar<span id="footnote-ref-81b1"><a href="#footnote-81b1">[1]</a></span>."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue finally cheered up and used her small fist to hit Chen Shi’s shoulders as they went downstairs. "You’re forbidden to associate with other beautiful women, do you hear!"</p>
 <p>"After seeing you, there are no longer any beautiful women in the world." Chen Shi replied, "Ah, yes, you should just move here, so you don't have to worry."</p>
 <p>"Hmm, I think about it!"</p>
 <p>After eating a seafood meal, Chen Shi felt very distressed for his wallet. The price for incurring the jealousy of women was really high. Lin Dongxue and Tao Yueyue were very happy on the other hand. Tao Yueyue asked, "Sister Lin, if Uncle Chen cheated on you one day, what would you do?"</p>
 <p>"Not much. I’d just kill him."</p>
 <p>"But men seem to often end up cheating. Our teacher is considering divorce because of this the past two days. She’s been quite absent-minded during class."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue gave Chen Shi a glare. "It's best that I don’t find out! ‘Female Police Officer Shoots Cheating Boyfriend.’ Do you think that this news will cause a sensation?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked helpless. "Can you two discuss something girls would normally talk about?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue rebutted, "Loathsome men is always a popular topic among girls."</p>
 <p>"Just you wait. When you meet a boyfriend someday, I’ll tell people everywhere."</p>
 <p>"About the pizza..." Tao Yueyue glanced slyly at Lin Dongxue.</p>
 <p>"Don't groundlessly imply something as if I really have some sort of dark secret."</p>
 <p>"You have an abundant supply of secrets anyway." Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue's cell phone rang, but she was still holding a crab leg. Chen Shi helped her to answer and pressed it to her ear.</p>
 <p>"What... Where..." After the conversation, Lin Dongxue said, "There’s a new victim."</p>
 <p>"I'll send Yueyue back and I'll pick you up later." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"I'll wait for you by the door."</p>
 <p>At 8:30PM, the two rushed to the scene of the crime. It was near a parking lot in a housing district. The victim was sitting in an SUV in the middle of a wooded area. The deceased was a pitiable-looking male who had been stabbed a few times.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Is this a new case or a new victim of our serial killer?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu handed over the evidence, "Have a look at it yourself."</p>
 <p>It was a thin aluminum stick with red and white stripes on it and a rubber pad at the end. From the structure, it had snapped off from a retractable cane. Chen Shi asked, "Guide cane?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it was found in the car. It shouldn’t be a copycat murder."</p>
 <p>In addition to the stick, a button was found in the car. It clearly did not belong to the victim. The police laid the body down outside, and the stab wounds on his body were concentrated around the heart, similar to the serial killer's usual method.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi noted, "This woman is getting more and more skilled, but she’s also getting more impatient. This time, she killed before entering the house. Right, where is the mobile phone?"</p>
 <p>"I didn't find it. Maybe it was taken away." Lin Qiupu suddenly remembered, and immediately called the office and asked the information department to geolocate the victim's mobile phone number.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi figured that he couldn’t help much even if he stayed there, so he went to look for surveillance footage with Lin Dongxue The footage showed that the car had entered the housing district three hours ago, and then about twenty minutes later, a person in a jacket and hat had left the community.</p>
 <p>It was June at the moment, so it was abnormal to be so tightly wrapped up. However, the suspected killer in the footage had walked briskly and didn’t seem blind at all.</p>
 <p>Except for this person, there were no other suspicious people during that period. The killer might have left the housing district by climbing over the wall. Otherwise, this person was the person they were looking for.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought to himself that when she came in, she was clearly carrying the guide cane, but why was she walking normally when she left? Perhaps the killer was pretending to be blind, but what was the point in doing so?</p>
 <p><em>The assumption that pretending to be blind made it easier to commit murder wouldn’t hold. The killer was judged to be a weak woman from her body build. Whether she was blind or not, the victims were unlikely to be on their guard.</em></p>
 <p><em>Moreover, the inference that the killer had poor eyesight was derived from facts. Perhaps something had happened to the killer recently that suddenly restored her vision!</em></p>
 <p><em>No, the guide cane...</em></p>
 <p><em>Perhaps if she killed people, her vision would be restored, and this was the huge benefit she derives from killing!</em></p>
 <p>This idea was too ridiculous. Chen Shi couldn't believe his own thoughts. When she saw him frowning, Lin Dongxue asked, "What's wrong?"</p>
 <p>"Uh, I want to smoke..."</p>
 <p>"I can’t believe you!"</p>
 <p>"Let's go around and see if the killer had left by climbing the walls."</p>
