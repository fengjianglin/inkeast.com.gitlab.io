 <p>Chen Shi said, “I don't want to go to that kind of place! Also, you were arrested in the last two days, and caused trouble for me!”</p>
 <p>The man patted Chen Shi's shoulder and laughed, “I’m a man. Was I born with a cock, only to use it for peeing? That was a pretty unlucky day. I had just taken off the woman's clothes when the police came. I was so angry. I was going to let it all out today. Surely, I won’t be as unlucky as last time, right?”</p>
 <p>“Can you not? Stop messing around!”</p>
 <p>“Ah, Officer Song, you’re the one stealing my identity, aren’t you? Why should I listen to you? It is my freedom to do as I like - Even to kill and set fire<span id="footnote-ref-86c0"><a href="#footnote-86c0">[1]</a></span>!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sighed helplessly, “I’ll give you money. Can you leave Long'an?”</p>
 <p>“That's why you're looking for me today? How much?”</p>
 <p>“50,000!”</p>
 <p>“Are you making fun of me?”</p>
 <p>“500,000!”</p>
 <p>“Add another zero and I might think about it.”</p>
 <p>“I only have 500,000 in my savings. Take it or leave it.”</p>
 <p>“Haha!” The man laughed and patted Chen Shi's shoulder. “Officer Song, I actually admired you very much in the past. You have become me now. I feel like I’m dreaming, as if I’ve become a detective. I won’t take your money. I went missing in the past few years because I was selling drugs in the Golden Triangle<span id="footnote-ref-a078"><a href="#footnote-a078">[2]</a></span>. I made a lot of money. I will return there when I finish handling my affairs here.”</p>
 <p>“What!?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, look at your reaction! I’m just joking with you. Actually, I’ve been helping to collect loan shark debts in Hunan in recent years. By the way, you're called Chen Shi, and I'm also called Chen Shi. It's strange. Call me by this name!” The man took out an identity card with his face on it, but his name was Wang Daji.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi raised his eyebrows. “You have two ID cards, but you gave the name “Chen Shi” when you were arrested?”</p>
 <p>“Of course! I won’t use my real name for embarrassing things... Yes, Wang Daji is my real name now, mainly because I’ve done some things, and both black and white sides<span id="footnote-ref-17cf"><a href="#footnote-17cf">[3]</a></span> are after me now.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi had a headache. <em>What kind of a guy is this?</em></p>
 <p>Wang Daji said, “Let's go. We should go to the Prosperity Club. The girls there are beautiful.”</p>
 <p>“Get lost. I have to pick up the child!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you have children? Your child is my child. Let’s go together!”</p>
 <p>“Leave me your contact details. I’ll come back and talk to you later.”</p>
 <p>“No, you can come to the Prosperity Club at eight o'clock in the evening. See you there!” Wang Daji opened the car door and left.</p>
 <p>“Asshole, don’t go!” Chen Shi yelled as he continued to leave.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went to school to pick up Tao Yueyue. She saw that he was deep in thought, and asked, “Uncle Chen, have you quarreled with Sister Lin?”</p>
 <p>“It's more serious than that.”</p>
 <p>“Oh... If it’s personal, I won't ask.”</p>
 <p>“What a good girl! Yueyue, don't ever lie in the future. A lie often requires countless lies to back it up.”</p>
 <p>“You adults always do the wrong things and then try to educate children to do the right things, huh?”</p>
 <p>“I never thought of you as a child.”</p>
 <p>“Can I eat junk food tonight then?”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue pulled a face.</p>
 <p>He sent Tao Yueyue home and told her not to go out at night. After finding out that Zhou Xiao was back, Chen Shi had installed alarms and monitors at his and Lin Dongxue's houses just in case.</p>
 <p>He drove to the Prosperity Club. The street was full of bright lights. Chen Shi looked up and saw the security camera on the wall. Without entering the building, he stood in the dark and waited for Wang Daji.</p>
 <p>At 8:30, Wang Daji appeared with a bag in his arms and said with a smile, “Did I come on time?”</p>
 <p>“You’re on time. It’s Beijing Time that’s inaccurate.” Chen Shi said sarcastically.</p>
 <p>“Come here and change your clothes.” Wang Daji pulled out an outfit similar to what he was wearing from the bag.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Are you going to change into it or not?”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“I'm going to rob a convenience store now and let the surveillance camera record my face. Let’s see who the police will arrest.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was helpless, so he changed into the clothes. Wang Daji stood close to him, and said with a smile, “Yes, our height is similar as well. When we stand like this, we look like real brothers.”</p>
 <p>“I really want to kill you!”</p>
 <p>“How could Officer Song do such a thing? By the way, are you still a policeman?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took out his documents, and Wang Daji exclaimed after a glance, “Criminal Consultant? Fuck! It seems that you’re still in the same profession. Did the guy who framed you get caught? In fact, I have a lead!”</p>
 <p>He couldn’t tell if Wang Daji was lying or not underneath his smile. Chen Shi asked suspiciously, “Really?”</p>
 <p>“Really. As long as you cooperate with me, I will tell you. Not only will I tell you, I will leave Long’an when I am done with things here and I will never give you any trouble again.”</p>
 <p>“I warn you. You can’t commit crimes.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes. For sure! Wait for me here. I need to go up and find someone.”</p>
 <p>Wang Daji went up and Chen Shi waited around for the time it took to smoke three cigarettes. Wang Daji ran out suddenly with his face stained with blood. He ran off and shouted, “Hit that bastard!” Then he dove into a lane.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi widened his eyes and saw two men following Wang. One was as thin as a monkey and had a blue dragon tattoo. The other was fat with a tiger tattooed on his chest, and both men wore bathrobes.</p>
 <p>When the thin man saw Chen Shi, he immediately looked shocked. Chen Shi smashed his nose with his fist and the thin man moaned.</p>
 <p>The fat man yelled, and tried to pounce on Chen Shi. Chen Shi ran in the opposite direction, kicked off on the wall, jumped and then kicked the fat man's chest. The other party staggered and fell on his bum onto the ground.</p>
 <p>You must see blood when you kill. Now that things have come to this, Chen Shi didn’t plan to let them get up. He rushed over, lifted the fat man by the big gold chain on his neck and strangled him with the chain from behind. Then he said with a loud voice, “Try provoking me again!”</p>
 <p>The thin man knelt down and begged for mercy, “Brother Chen, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have seduced your wife.”</p>
 <p><em>What?!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Shi was startled internally, but he continued with a fierce expression. “In the future, if I ever see you in Long’an, I will beat you. Get lost!”</p>
 <p>The two got up and ran, with the fat man shouting behind from a distance, “Hey, wait for me!”</p>
 <p>There were many people around watching. Chen Shi turned around and entered the alley. Wang Daji squatted behind the trash can and beckoned. He stuffed a wad of paper into his nose and laughed nonstop, “Quite awesome, Officer Song. The ability to think on your feet is really strong! I admire you!”</p>
 <p>“Why provoke others? I can tell those two aren’t good people at a glance.”</p>
 <p>“I provoked them?” Wang Daji said indignantly, “Do you know why I came back to Long’an this time? Half a month ago, I went onto a porn site and actually saw my girl doing it with others. The person who did my girl was actually that skinny guy. I was so angry that if I didn’t calm down a little along the way over here, I would have killed him today!”</p>
 <p>“Your wife?”</p>
 <p>“No, she's just my girl.”</p>
 <p>“Why did they do this?”</p>
 <p>“Because three years ago, I chopped off one of their boss's fingers and the old man let the word out that he was going to chop off all ten of my fingers. Since I went into hiding, they couldn’t find me and fucked my woman instead!” Wang Daji's eyes glowed fiercely, and he stood up, “Let’s go, brother. We need to go and find my woman!”</p>
