 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi immediately knew that the manager was lying. He said, "Your project has been restarted recently, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no..." the manager said in a panic. "I already said that there was a problem with the capital. Besides, isn’t Director Dong missing? How could it be restarted?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"As long as someone is willing to pay, the project will be restarted. Is that person's surname Lu?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don’t know what you're talking about…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How heavy is the satellite?" Lin Dongxue asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Returning to professional questions, the manager calmed down again. He replied, "There are large and small ones. Early satellites were only tens or even a few kilograms. Now, satellites are equipped with more and more equipment and some have reached one ton."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is it harder to build rockets or satellites?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It has to be satellites. Rockets have no technical content. Anyone with a little knowledge of science and engineering can make their own rockets. Of course, they don’t fly as high as hydrogen-fueled rockets."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu called them aside and the three of them had already guessed what had happened. "Lu Qi is going to build that rocket and launch Dong Xiao's body into space!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although they guessed it, the shock was still indescribable. If it was true, it would definitely be an unprecedented masterpiece in the history of world crime.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Has something been misunderstood somewhere? How could someone do this kind of thing?" Lin Qiupu struggled for the last time. He even wondered if he was dreaming. How could there be such a thing?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Money can make ghosts grind for you. It could be done with Lu Qi's financial resources... By the way, is his account frozen yet?" Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It must be frozen, but there’s only a bit over one million in it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lu Qi’s house is worth over one million. He must have transferred his assets to other accounts. Accounts that the police cannot find."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu immediately called the Information Department and asked them to investigate it thoroughly again. At this moment, a tall and thin man pushed the door open and handed a document over to the manager. As he passed, he and Chen Shi looked at each other. Wasn’t this the buyer that appeared in the surveillance footage?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue also reacted. She went up and pressed the man’s hands behind his back and handcuffed him. The manager was frightened. "Aiya, this is Little Zhang from my company. He’s not a bad guy. What are you doing?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu also froze for a moment. After making a phone call, they had caught a suspect, so he asked what was going on. Chen Shi whispered to explain the situation. Lin Qiupu said, "Take him back for questioning."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I'm afraid it would be too late. Just question him here!" Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They took this person to an office and closed the door. He looked very nervous as Chen Shi asked, "Do you know why we detained you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Little Zhang shook his head desperately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi used the computer on the desk to show him the surveillance video copied from the supermarket and asked, "Is this you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Police officer, am I breaking the law when I go to the supermarket to buy things?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The place where you bought things was where we found Lu Qi's hiding place. He’s basically a fugitive right now. Why did you buy so many convenience foods? Why did you buy them every day? Are there many people in that workshop doing things? What are you making?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Little Zhang was silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu slammed on the table. "Did you see Dong Xiao's body?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Little Zhang was frightened and shook his head desperately. A layer of cold sweat broke out on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re building a rocket and planning to send that corpse to the sky, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing that the police had seen through their plan, Little Zhang became even more nervous, but he still didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter what they asked, Little Zhang remained silent. Chen Shi could see that they had taken Lu Qi's money and wouldn’t betray him even if they were faced with death. Otherwise, the money would be gone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the sake of money, people were even willing to risk their lives.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu scolded, "You’re helping a murderer and committing a felony, you know?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know what corpses you’re talking about. We just work based on the money we receive and build rockets." Little Zhang tried to argue in sophistry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager pushed the door in, holding a few cups of coffee in his hands. "Officers, calm down. You guys are thinking too much. Using rockets to launch corpses? Would a rocket that costs millions be used for that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who allowed you to come in?" Lin Qiupu asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The manager put the coffee down hesitantly and left. Before leaving, he gave Little Zhang a threatening look. This look didn’t escape Chen Shi's eyes. It seemed like the manager was also involved in this, but the people of the company’s personnel were aligned by the same purpose and no information would be leaked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had a hunch that the rocket may already have been launched or would be launched soon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing that they couldn't ask for any more information, Lin Dongxue said, "Brother, think of another way!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why did he come back?" Chen Shi said, "He must have finished his job. Check where he’s been!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three hurriedly went downstairs to check the dash cam of the youngster, which showed that he had been to an extremely remote place in the countryside. Lin Qiupu called other policemen to deal with this place and drove there hurriedly with Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Dongxue was thinking wildly along the way.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">This can't be true. It can’t be true, right?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Lu Qi intended to use this crazy method to dispose of the corpse, could the police spend tens of millions to build a satellite trap like the Soviet Union during the Cold War to retrieve the corpse that turned into a satellite?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few hours later, they arrived at the location and saw a snow-white rocket standing on the empty ground from a distance, with a makeshift launch tower around it. A bunch of people stood below it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi and Su Chan were also among them. Their size was too noticeable. Lu Qi was talking to people. He suddenly noticed the car and said something to the people next to him. Those people immediately moved.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Asshole. Stop him!" Lin Qiupu shouted, "Speed up!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ve stepped on the accelerator as far down as possible." The car soared so fast that it was like they were flying. There wasn’t any road there. It was all grasslands covered with a thin layer of snow. The three of them bounced around in the car and they were all getting dizzy, but they couldn’t care about that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they were about to arrive, they saw a pillar of fire spouting from the launch tower, and the rumbling sound drowned out everything around them, shaking the bones of the three of them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They got out of the car and ran over. Lin Qiupu gritted his teeth angrily, drew his gun, and prepared to shoot. Chen Shi said loudly, "No! If the fuel tank explodes, everyone here will die!" His voice was completely overwhelmed by the loud noise of the rocket.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu probably realized it as well. In the end, he put his gun away and stamped his feet in anger. The three of them could only watch the snow-white, slender rocket slowly rise into the sky, getting faster and faster. Lu Qi stood below against the background of heavy smoke. He spread his hands and laughed, shouting wildly.</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the rocket rose a few meters into the sky, they finally heard what Lu Qi was yelling about: "Police, come and catch me! Hahahaha!"</span></p>
