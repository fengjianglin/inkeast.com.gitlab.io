 <p>Tao Yueyue sat in the car and the woman handed her a bottle of water. Tao Yueyue declined politely. "Thank you, aunty. I’m not thirsty."</p>
 <p>The man asked, "What is your home address?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue gave an address. At this time, Chen shi would definitely still be at the city bureau. He had been involved in a case over the past few days.</p>
 <p>The man found it on the GPS and said with surprise, "That place is the City’s Public Security Bureau. Are you mistaken?"</p>
 <p>"No, my father is there to work."</p>
 <p>"Your father is a local police officer?"</p>
 <p>"Criminal police!"</p>
 <p>"What about your mother?"</p>
 <p>"Mom has already left."</p>
 <p>The woman sighed, "Haii, what a poor child."</p>
 <p>The man said, "This is probably due to her being the child of a criminal police officer. It calls for the bad guys in society to retaliate. It’s not easy to be an officer. Little sister, you must be extra careful in the future. If you didn’t meet us today, you would have been in danger.”</p>
 <p>"Thank you, uncle!"</p>
 <p>When they got to the city bureau, Chen Shi, who had received the text message, came out. Tao Yueyue rushed to him and shouted affectionately, "Dad!"</p>
 <p>Listening to this tone, it was obvious that she was acting. Chen Shi acted accordingly and picked her up for a hug. "Why are you here? These two are..."</p>
 <p>"Don't mention it. Your daughter was almost retaliated against by bad guys today…” The man pretended to recall the situation and portrayed himself as a hero who helped her out.</p>
 <p>After listening, Chen Shi was a bit surprised. The man suddenly had a thought. <em>Fuck, I forgot to mention about the compensation for the window.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>According to the version of the story he described, he couldn’t bring up the window. He blew too much<span id="footnote-ref-b0f7"><a href="#footnote-b0f7">[1]</a></span> and dug his own grave.</p>
 <p>However, a single window didn’t matter too much. It was enough of a reward for him to have the opportunity to get to know a criminal police officer. He said with a smile, "I forgot to introduce myself. I am in the clothing business. This is my business card."</p>
 <p>He handed a business card over with his hands. It read that he was a deputy manager of a clothing company, Xue Chengyi.</p>
 <p>"Officer Chen, let’s enjoy a light meal together if you ever have the time." Xue Chengyi said.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was too embarrassed to refuse and said, "Of course, I’ll be sure to. Thank you for saving my daughter today, otherwise things would have been very serious."</p>
 <p>"It was the right thing to do. It’s the duty of the citizens to be righteous! Then, we’ll be leaving first..."</p>
 <p>"Okay, I won’t send you off then! Have a safe trip!" Chen Shi's eyes lingered on the woman's butt for a few seconds. The waist above the buttocks was connected with the left hand of the man wearing a wedding ring.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi squatted down and looked at Tao Yueyue with a serious look. "Tell me what happened."</p>
 <p>After Tao Yueyue finished explaining, Chen Shi felt that Tao Yueyue had no responsibility for this incident. On the contrary, she was very brave and clever. However, he did not intend to praise her and said, "If you didn’t design a plan to hurt him, this wouldn’t have happened. You should reflect on that.”</p>
 <p>"If you didn't tell him the truth and let him think it was just an accident, then this wouldn’t have happened today either.” Tao Yueyue reasoned maturely.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "Is this all my fault then?"</p>
 <p>"It <em>is</em> your fault!"</p>
 <p>"Then, you were right in retaliating against your classmate?”</p>
 <p>"Liang Zuoming is not a good kid. ‘Miso’ said that he also bullied other students before I transferred to this school. He deserved it! Do you hope that I will accept the bullying, or let the teacher come forward to play mediator? All the teachers in the world were taught in a school. They will only say that 'flies don’t fly on clean eggs<span id="footnote-ref-ea1d"><a href="#footnote-ea1d">[2]</a></span>’, 'Why are they only bullying you but not the others?', or those sorts of irritating but irrefutable words.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was speechless and said, "We will not talk about this matter right now. We will talk about it tomorrow."</p>
 <p>"You can’t beat me." Tao Yueyue said proudly as if the danger that had just happened had been left behind.</p>
 <p>"Yes, I can’t, so I have to think about how to educate you since you’re a special child." Chen Shi touched her head. "Let’s go home together when I get off of work."</p>
 <p>"Can I go and see Sister Lin?"</p>
 <p>"She is still working!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue pouted and Chen Shi offered, "I’ll take you to see the forensic tests, okay?"</p>
 <p>"Sounds good!"</p>
 <p>Early the next morning, Chen Shi put the breakfast he made in front of Tao Yueyue and sat down. Tao Yueyue now had a short layer of hair and didn’t wear a hat at home.</p>
 <p>"I’ll tell you a story." Chen Shi began, "One day, a scorpion wanted to cross the river. He said to a frog, ‘Brother Frog, can you carry me across the river?’ The frog answered, ‘No. You have a stinger and will poison me.’ The scorpion countered, ‘If I poison you, I’ll drown as well!’ The frog thought about it and found this argument reasonable. Thus, he crossed the river with the scorpion. What he didn’t expect was that halfway across, the scorpion poisoned the frog and the two drowned together. Before their death, the frog asked, ‘Why?’ The scorpion said helplessly, ‘Sorry. This is my nature!’"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue listened intently and said, "So you mean to say..."</p>
 <p>"I’ve thought for a whole night. Your nature is like this so I shouldn’t try to change you. If I force you to be like others, then it would be very painful for you. There would be no difference in your experience at school. The flaws of the education system are something I know very well because I was a genius when I was a child… I know that after yesterday’s events, you have a fire in your heart and your character will not allow you to spare Liang Zuoming...” Chen Shi paused, “I’ll give you permission. Get revenge on him!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue widened her eyes in surprise before calming back down. "What are the conditions?"</p>
 <p>"First, don't be discovered by the school. If you are found out, avoid getting punished. Secondly, you aren’t allowed to retaliate him in a physical manner. Third, you must have good reasons to carry out retaliatory actions! These three apply to this matter, but it also applies to things you will encounter in the future.”</p>
 <p>"Can the second rule be changed?"</p>
 <p>"Absolutely not!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue shrugged helplessly. "The plan that I thought of last night must be changed then."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought to himself. <em>What a terrifying child. She actually thought up a revenge plan already.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The three articles he proposed seemed to encourage her, but in fact they were constraints that increased the difficulty for her, since she would undoubtedly take revenge. At least this would prevent Tao Yueyue from straying onto the path of evil.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue’s mother was a prostitute so who was her father? There were more than a dozen candidates. She grew up with her mother’s abuse and indifference. Later, she saw her mother being killed right in front of her. When she was facing the police, she was young. Her calmness was a little scary. At first, the police didn’t believe her testimony. How could an 8-year-old girl hide in the closet for three hours and witness her mother being brutally murdered without any movement or tears?</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue’s heart held a small poisonous snake. It was necessary to periodically squeeze some venom from its head to prevent it from attacking people one day.</p>
 <p>After many serial killers were arrested, the police found that they were surprisingly not arrogant. On the contrary, they were polite, introverted, and they were very caring for small animals. They were recognized as good neighbors and good citizens.</p>
 <p>The man who killed Tao Yueyue’s mother was also such a person.</p>
 <p>If a person is suppressed for too long, there will always be problems. Catharsis is necessary for mental health. A society needs games, competition, adult culture, and online literature. In Chen Shi’s opinion, those who go out at night to party and find escorts, then advocate that video games are damaging the growth of children were simply assholes!</p>
 <p>"Also," Chen Shi continued, "After you retaliate against him, you must report everything to me truthfully. Rest assured, I am definitely not an adult that would go against his word."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue stood up and went to Chen Shi and planted a kiss on his cheek with her mouth full of porridge. She said, "Uncle Chen, you have subverted my prejudice against adults. Thank you!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled and tapped her nose. "Satisfied? You little devil!"</p>
