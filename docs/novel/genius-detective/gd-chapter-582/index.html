 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yan Ke was sitting in the empty interrogation room. The recording device had been turned off. During the interrogation, he had been soaked in cold sweat all over, again and again. The policeman's eyes showed that he clearly knew everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">If he hadn’t had the lawyer beside him, he would have broken down long ago. However, he still had lingering fears and he wasn’t sure how many cards the opponent had up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At this time, the lawyer slipped in, holding a bottle of mineral water in his hand. He leaned over and said, "Want to live?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yan Ke nodded desperately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"If you want to live, you need to self-harm. The more seriously, the better!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The two men’s faces were almost touching. Yan Ke saw muscles twitching under the lawyer’s skin while he was talking, and he looked very sinister. The eyes hidden behind his glasses were expressionless. Yan Ke seemed to have an illusion that Teacher Zhou was watching him through these eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The lawyer straightened up and walked away, leaving him to imagine endless horrible possibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When he got outside, Xu Xiaodong stopped him, "What did you go in for?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The lawyer shrugged. "Just passing him a bottle of water."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who permitted it?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Xu Xiaodong rushed in and took the bottle of mineral water away, just in case. Who knew if there was anything in the water?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The lawyer curled his lip indifferently and lit a cigarette in the hallway. Chen Shi walked over and said, "Lawyer Wang, right? I just called your office and found that no one picked up the phone. I have done a little investigation. You’re the only one working at your so-called office, and you haven’t had any business over the last few years. It isn’t fake, is it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It’s a registered company. Whether there’s business or not, is my own affair. It's none of your business!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi approached him and smiled threateningly, "I advise you not to associate with Zhou Tiannan. On the day that he is arrested, misfortune will befall you as well!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The lawyer shook his cigarette indignantly, "Are you threatening me? Look, this police officer is threatening me. I’ll sue you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi took out his ID, "I’m not a policeman. Just a passing citizen, bye-bye!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, the sound of wailing and howling came from the interrogation room, and the police rushed in. They saw Yan Ke cradling a hand that was bleeding profusely. He cried out, "She’s dead and you still doubt me. I’ll just die in the name of love. Xiaoxiao!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue grabbed his hand to have a look and instantly her scalp crawled. He had actually bitten off one of his fingers. His mouth was full of blood. When he wailed, they could even see the broken finger moving around on his tongue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Send him to hospital! Hurry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yan Ke was taken away, and the lawyer exclaimed loudly and gleefully, "I can testify that the policeman was the last person to see him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Xu Xiaodong was so angry that his face went pale, "Stop slandering others. You were the one who passed him water without permission. I just took the water away."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who knows if you had said anything that threatened him? Look at the attitude of all of you police officers. You all treated my client as if he was the real criminal. I reserve the right to sue you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi clenched his fist. He really wanted to punch him in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi suddenly thought of something and dragged Lin Dongxue aside, "Check who the lawyer just called!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That... That’s unauthorized! It’s best not to mess around at this critical point."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Check it!" Chen Shi insisted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The lawyer's business card had his number on it. Upon checking, it was found that he had just called an anonymous number. The length of the conversation wasn’t very long and it had happened just after the interrogation ended.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi had a bad hunch. Yan Ke had a weak personality. The sudden self-mutilation was obviously instructed by someone else. He said, "Let’s go to the school!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue finished lunch and went back to the classroom to read a book. Someone knocked on the window and whispered her name. She turned and saw that it was Cao Rui.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Ever since she had accompanied him to the public security bureau to have his statement taken down that day, he had "harassed" her on WeChat every day. Tao Yueyue put down her book and left the classroom. She said, "What are you doing? It will be bad if my classmates saw you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I missed you..." Cao Rui scratched his head and simpered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue turned away and Cao Rui quickly said, "Don't, don’t, I'm just joking. Why can’t you take jokes? I’m looking for you regarding serious business.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue raised her eyebrows and stared at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Let’s go to the store we went to last time after school. There’s an event today."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why should I go with you? Am I that familiar with you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Ah... that... didn't your dad ask you to protect me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"He didn't say that."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I saw Teacher Yan being taken away this morning. Haha, the real murderer finally got arrested. I finally let out a sigh of relief. I’ll invite you out to eat!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"No!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It's quiet outside the school. No one will see us. Besides, you still care about this? You’re already the top student in the school. Who dares to gossip about you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I’m leaving."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I'll wait for you at the milk tea shop outside the school, okay? I’ll wait there the whole time. If you don’t come, I won't leave!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After saying this, Cao Rui left. Tao Yueyue read her book for a while, but felt restless. She put down the book and left the school. The milk tea shop was empty. Tao Yueyue was looking for Cao Rui when he poked his head out from under a seat with a smile. He waved her over. "I'm here!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue sat down and said, "Don't talk to me in the near future. Chen... My dad said that if someone knows that you’re the eyewitness, they may really retaliate against you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hasn’t Teacher Yan been caught already? What else is there to be afraid of?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Tch, a guy who doesn't understand anything."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Do you want to drink something?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Cao Rui bought two cups of milk tea. After sitting down, he began to talk about random things. Tao Yueyue didn’t hate him. Cao Rui talked a lot. He could go on by himself for half a day and she didn’t find it too boring to be sitting together with him, but she didn’t want to be seen by classmates and become the butt of gossip.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Especially Wei Zengmali. If she found out, it would mean that the whole universe would know.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, a car parked outside. Tao Yueyue recognized Chen Shi's car and ran out. Chen Shi also saw her and asked, "Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Uncle Chen!" Cao Rui greeted him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Great, you’re here!" Chen Shi breathed a sigh of relief, "Go to the Bureau with us."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"To do what?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"To identify the suspect."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What?!" Cao Rui was shocked. "Teacher Yan would recognize me. I don't want to. I don’t want to!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Silly boy, haven't you watched TV before? The glass in the interrogation room is one-sided. You stand on the other side and he can't see you at all."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Even then, I don't..." Cao Rui shook his head like a pellet drum. The object of his fears was very specific. It was Yan Ke. He would be afraid of even being in the same building as him. "Go and identify him, no way! I will identify him here now. It’s him. It’s him. It absolutely can’t be wrong."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Don’t you understand the law? Identification has to follow the procedure. You think that you can just say it verbally?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The law is so troublesome!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, the class bell rang. Cao Rui said, "I'm going back to the classroom."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue whispered, "It’s estimated that it will be evening at the earliest when Yan Ke is able to be interrogated again. Why don’t we keep guard here? There will be no outsiders in the school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi reminded Cao Rui, "Stay in the classroom at school in the afternoon. We will protect you outside. If anything happens, please contact me immediately."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Cao Rui incongruously saluted, "Yes, sir!"</span></p>
