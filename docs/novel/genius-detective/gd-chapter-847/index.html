<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>It was already 10:30 in the evening. Lin Qiupu sat in the car, making and answering calls non-stop. The police who had been sent out searched all the towns and counties around Xiaoyu Village. They all said that there was no news regarding&nbsp;Lin&nbsp;Dongxue’s whereabouts. He was distraught and kept tapping on the steering wheel with his finger.</p>
 <p>Putting down the phone, Lin Qiupu got out of the car to smoke a cigarette. He found Chen Shi standing beside him. When he saw Chen Shi, he got angry and asked, "Why are you here instead of looking for her?"</p>
 <p>"Why did Chu Wei kidnap Lin Dongxue? Revenge? To threaten? I can't think of the reason. Are you hiding something from me?" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"That's none of your business!"</p>
 <p>"Why doesn't it matter to me? I need to know all the information in order to evaluate the situation!" Chen Shi bellowed back at the same volume.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu glared at him for a few seconds, threw the cigarette away and stamped it out. He said in a huff, "You go back first. There are so many police officers. You’re not needed here."</p>
 <p>It seemed that Lin Qiupu wasn’t going to say it. Chen Shi sighed and took out a USB flash drive. "I just copied all the surveillance footage I could find of the surrounding area. If Chu Wei kidnapped Lin Dongxue on purpose, how would he know that Lin Dongxue was here? I think he had assistants."</p>
 <p>"He’s already like this, but he has assistants?"</p>
 <p>"He’s been living in this area for ten years. How could he not have any contacts?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu took the USB flash drive and said, "Let’s go to the police station in town to watch the footage!"</p>
 <p>The two went to the police station and borrowed two computers. Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue had gone to the hot pot restaurant at around 3:00 in the afternoon. They selected the surveillance footage around that time period.</p>
 <p>A surveillance camera at the hot pot restaurant caught Chu Wei walking down with an unconscious Lin Dongxue. Seeing this, Lin Qiupu gritted his teeth. He was so angry that he wanted to throw something.</p>
 <p>He watched this part repeatedly, hoping to find some clues.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi noticed the content on Lin Qiupu’s screen and said, “When we entered the hot pot restaurant, there was no truck downstairs. During this period, Chu Wei was wanted for arrest everywhere. I even memorized his license plate number. If I had seen it downstairs, I wouldn’t have missed it. Even if I missed it, Dongxue would have noticed.”</p>
 <p>"It must be driven there after both of you entered the restaurant..." Lin Qiupu said, followed his train of thought.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi nodded. "That's the only possible explanation, but the question is, how did he know that we were here? Was someone following us or was Chu Wei following us and his assistant drove the truck over during this period?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi searched through all the surveillance, and finally found a suitable angle that clearly recorded Chu Wei’s truck being quietly parked opposite the Huocheng restaurant with a person sitting in it at 3:00 in the afternoon. It obviously wasn’t Chu Wei, because he was carrying out the kidnapping at the time.</p>
 <p>The existence of the assistant was confirmed, but the two searched through all the surveillance and couldn’t find a clear picture of the assistant’s appearance. Lin Qiupu asked, "Why did you come to Xiaoyu Village in the afternoon again?"</p>
 <p>"To check the warehouse that Chu Wei had rented."</p>
 <p>"That's redundant. That warehouse had already been checked, and there were no clues."</p>
 <p>"But we still found clues. In the afternoon, we met a few kids who smoked marijuana. They were..." Chen Shi was stunned and muttered, "Marijuana? People Chu Wei would know... Get the local police station to check if there’s anyone here that has been detained before for smoking marijuana!"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu didn’t ask too much and just requested the local police to investigate. They searched on the computer and discovered two young people from a small county nearby. One was named Ah Chang and the other was named Ah Lin. They were both from out-of-town and didn’t hold proper jobs, so it wasn’t known how they supported themselves.</p>
 <p>Two years ago, the two of them were detained by the police for violating traffic regulations. The police saw the two of them grinning and seemingly in an abnormal state, so they detained them intuitively.</p>
 <p>Ah Chang had offered cigarettes to curry favor with the police. The police saw that the cigarettes looked a little strange. They took them back and took them apart. 80% of the contents was marijuana. Due to this, they were forced to go into rehab for three months. They should still be living in the surrounding area right now.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi suggested, "Let's go to the residence of these two people!"</p>
 <p>Since they were just trying their luck right now, Lin Qiupu agreed.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue had been trying to wear through the rope on her hands. She had found that it was impossible to untie the knot just by herself because her hands had been tied until they had gone numb. Coupled with the effect of the anaesthetic, she couldn’t exert any strength.</p>
 <p>Chu Wei had gone out, and the couple was taking drugs next door. There was no one in the house at the moment. It was a Heaven-sent opportunity. She gritted her teeth and continued to try.</p>
 <p>Footsteps.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue became nervous, and saw the drug addict open the door and enter. He had a foolish smile on his face because he had just smoked marijuana. He held a lit marijuana cigarette in his hand. He bent down and took a deep drag on the cigarette, blowing the smoke in Lin Dongxue's face.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue held her breath and frowned in disgust.</p>
 <p>The drug addict began to act in a sleazy manner. He caressed Lin Dongxue’s leg with his hand. His touch was disgusting. Lin Dongxue ground her teeth so hard that she almost broke them. She knew that after someone had smoked marijuana, they would be particularly stimulated in that respect. There was once a marijuana addict who ran outside an underwear shop after a late night smoking session, masturbated in front of Lin Chiling's poster and then fell asleep. He was reported to the police and arrested the next day.</p>
 <p>The drug addict grinned. Drool dripped from the corner of his mouth, and his palm moved up along Lin Dongxue's leg to untie her belt.</p>
 <p>"Get lost! Stay away from me!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue writhed and struggled desperately, trying to get away from the stroking of a lust-filled stranger. No expression could describe her disgust.</p>
 <p>Her struggles didn't have any effect, but the shouting alerted the female drug addict. She walked through the door and stared with her arms on her hips. When the male drug addict saw her, he was startled and rebuckled the belt that he had just unbuckled.</p>
 <p>But this couldn't make up for anything. The female drug addict came over, pushed the male drug addict down, and began to beat him. The male drug addict rolled on the ground, picking up a plastic basin to protect his head. Their movements were silent, like an absurd pantomime.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue discovered something. She had struggled too hard just then and had actually pulled the chair beam that the rope was tied to out of its joint.</p>
 <p>This of course didn’t mean that she was free. First of all, she had to shift her hands behind her back to the front. Her shoulder joints would have to be twisted almost three hundred and sixty degrees, which was physically possible but would be very painful...</p>
 <p>The male drug addict finally escaped. The female drug addict closed the door, bent down, and stared directly at Lin Dongxue's eyes. As her pale face got closer and closer, Lin Dongxue retreated backwards in contempt, not wanting to smell her bad breath.</p>
 <p>The female drug addict also put her hand on her leg and caressed it. Lin Dongxue was very nervous. She was even more nervous than before, because she didn't know what the other party wanted to do.</p>
 <p>Then she slapped Lin Dongxue's face. Lin Dongxue’s face reeled to the side from the impact. The female drug addict opened her mouth and let out a panting laugh. She pulled&nbsp;Lin&nbsp;Dongxue's chin and turned her face around, glaring at her fiercely.</p>
 <p>"How many people did you sleep with to become a police officer? Slut!" asked the drug addict.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue stared at her in great indignation, and the female drug addict slapped her again. However, the extremely angry Lin Dongxue calmed down and said, "I know why you’re beating me."</p>
 <p>"Are you trying to say that I’m envious of you? You stinking slut!" The female drug addict raised her hand, preparing to continue her attack.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue suddenly twisted her hands over from behind, enduring the pain of her joints. She hooked the female drug addict's neck with both hands, and slammed her forehead against her head. The drug addict collapsed onto the floor, and Lin Dongxue quickly bent over to untie the rope around her feet. She was anxious and knew she had to be quick.</p>
