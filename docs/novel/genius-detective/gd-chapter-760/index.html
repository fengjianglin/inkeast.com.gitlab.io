<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Actually, I had a similar dream as you last night, but I didn’t agree to that girl’s proposal. Isn’t it strange when you think about it? She can 'buy' anyone with her dreams, so why not just let me experience it first? Why does it need to be approved by me first? It’s because this is basically a hypnotic step, which makes you sink in step by step... When you slept last night, someone next to you was talking to you and inducing you to have these dreams. "</p>
 <p>Xin Bai drew in a breath of horror. "The Dream Master in your dream was a girl?"</p>
 <p>"Was she of a different image in your dream?"</p>
 <p>"Although she was also a girl, she was a monster with tentacles as her lower body and some weird symbols around her..."</p>
 <p>"Isn't this like the small sculpture you saw in the prison? I’m different from you. I met the girl first, so the image of the Dream Master in my dreams became her... All of this is just a conspiracy. Someone is obstructing our investigation, which is enough to show that we’re very close to the truth."</p>
 <p>Xin Bai lowered his head and muttered to himself. "But that dream was really cool..."</p>
 <p>"Wake up! Indulging in dreams will only turn you into trash; a puppet at the mercy of others. Using wonderful dreams to dominate others is the method of those people... See? you haven't updated the last two days!"</p>
 <p>Xin Bai looked ashamed. "I’ll write today when I get back."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked, "Shall we continue to investigate in the town or go back to the city?"</p>
 <p>"Let’s go back to the city. I don't care what happened in the past. The most important thing right now is that no one gets killed again."</p>
 <p>The three of them bought tickets and went home, just in time for the last bus back to the city. After an exhausting day, Chen Shi fell asleep on the bus. In a half-asleep and half-awake state, he heard someone say in his ear like they were breathing, "Everything is sinking! Everything is sinking!"</p>
 <p>He opened his eyes suddenly and found himself in the small broken room again, and "Ring" was broadcasting on the TV at the most eerie part.</p>
 <p>"Asshole!"</p>
 <p>He turned his head and ran outside. When he got out, he saw that the sky was a blushing red, heavy on top of his head. This was a dilapidated town and the ground was covered with ashes from a fire.</p>
 <p>On the side of the road, there was a crowd that knelt and struggled as blue flames burst from the gaps in their bodies. They screamed in pain and a man on fire rushed towards Chen Shi screaming. Chen Shi quickly avoided the man in fright.</p>
 <p>Everyone in this town was experiencing a strange spontaneous combustion, and the ashes on the ground were left by them.</p>
 <p>As if being urged by something, he arrived at a place with a huge platform made up of house wreckage, on top of which was a girl in school uniform, kneeling down. Her face was covered with blood and her hands were stretched out towards the sky. Her eyes were mournful.</p>
 <p>"Lasidajinjiuma, Hatagelisi, Aiqikusouliwaqiu..."</p>
 <p>Accompanied by that strange and inexplicable language, a vortex appeared in the sky facing the platform, and a half-naked woman with a lower body full of tentacles came down from the inside. Her eyes were completely white.</p>
 <p>The monster slowly approached the girl kneeling on the platform as if it was floating. At this moment, Chen Shi noticed that the girl was holding a bright red item in her hand. It was beating constantly. There was a huge hole in her chest, and dark blood stained her school uniform.</p>
 <p>"Dream Master, I will dedicate myself to you and punish all those who have hurt me!" The girl shouted like a storm.</p>
 <p>Under Chen Shi's shocked gaze, the monster wrapped the girl's whole body with its tentacles, wrapped her human upper body around her neck, and pressed the girl’s face to her forehead, revealing a strange tenderness.</p>
 <p>"This is the truth you’re looking for. A poor girl sacrificed herself and gained the ability to punish her enemies!"</p>
 <p>A calm voice came from behind him. Chen Shi turned around and saw the little girl wearing a white dress and holding a bunch of blood-like red flowers.</p>
 <p>"Don't use these things to perfunctorily assuage me. These are just thoughts that flashed in my brain..." Chen Shi pointed to the sky. "This is just my dream, and the most exaggerated and bizarre pictures will always appear in dreams."</p>
 <p>The girl smiled faintly. "You will never understand this kind of mood. Hatred burns your whole body like flames, tearing at your chest, making you unable to breathe!"</p>
 <p>"No, of course I’ve experienced it. I have also had someone I really wanted to kill, but it is a sad life to live for revenge."</p>
 <p>"If you were honest with yourself, didn’t you get your revenge? When you couldn’t do anything when facing Zhou Tiannan, didn't you also choose to make him pay an eye for an eye?"</p>
 <p>"Motherfucker!" Chen Shi yelled angrily. "I didn't kill him. I would never use this method to solve the problem."</p>
 <p>"Vengeance is great. It's great to see the person who ruined your life die helplessly like an ant. It’s joyous."</p>
 <p>"I haven't killed anyone!" Chen Shi gritted his teeth. "Even if I hate them to death!"</p>
 <p>"Have you ever asked yourself a question? If you’re Chen Shi, then where is Song Lang? Has he disappeared, or is he still in your heart? Would this wounded soul wake up in your sleep?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked at his hands and feet as he touched his face. He was actually Chen Shi now. He became Chen Shi in his dream!</p>
 <p>No, that's not right. Why should he believe this?!</p>
 <p>He needed to wake up from this damn dream right away. Thus, he turned and ran, and a cliff appeared in front of him. He jumped down without thinking in desperation. The weightlessness of the fall made him wake up with sweat and he found himself sitting in the bus again. The sun outside the window seemed to be roasting him, and Lin Dongxue next to him looked at him in surprise.</p>
 <p>"What happened to you?"</p>
 <p>"Did anyone get off the bus just now?!" Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>"Uh, a thin man got out of the bus halfway, just after... you fell asleep."</p>
 <p>It was the same method!!!</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stood up and asked the driver to stop. The driver said no, so he could only sit back in the chair in grief and put his head in his hands. What happened in his dreams still gave him lingering fear.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue handed him a wet tissue and said, "Wipe your sweat!"</p>
 <p>"Thank you." Chen Shi took it.</p>
 <p>"Speaking of which, you often have nightmares. Sometimes, I don't dare to sleep with you. You’ll yell and scream in your dreams."</p>
 <p>"I... I have something in my heart that causes anxiety." Chen Shi admitted with a wry smile.</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, I won't ask. When you’re willing to talk about it, tell me!" Lin Dongxue smiled slightly.</p>
 <p>"Thank you." There was a warmth in Chen Shi's heart.</p>
 <p>"That's right!" Lin Dongxue picked up her phone, "I just found this Du Zilin. Do you know who he is? He started his own business after graduation, and he’s worth hundreds of millions in his thirties. However, he isn’t famous for this. Have you heard of the 6.21 car accident?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought for a while. "I remember a driver who drove their car onto the sidewalk without the influence of drinking, drugs, or driving fatigue, and killed 13 people. The lawyer showed a mental appraisal report in the courts that said he had something like acute transient mental disorder and he only got sentenced for ten years."</p>
 <p>"Yes, that was the case. That person is Du Zilin, so he’s particularly infamous... By the way, he received commutation three times in prison, and has already been released. He is now in Long'an."</p>
