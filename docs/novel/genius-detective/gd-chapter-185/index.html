 <p>Dog Egg didn't know if the bad woman had fallen. He stared at the bad woman for a long time, but the bad woman didn’t move at all, so he boldly went inside.</p>
 <p>"His concept of death is still very vague," Chen Shi interjected.</p>
 <p>Then, Dog Egg had an idea. The bad woman had money at home. If he stole some money, his grandma wouldn’t have to sleep in the cold, hard, and little house. He silently snuck into the bedroom while walking past the blood on the ground.</p>
 <p>Dog Egg found Aunty Pingzi on the ground as well. Dog Egg thought that Aunty Pingzi was a good person, so he went up and shook her to wake up. That’s why he had a whole hand full of red stuff.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, footsteps came from the living room. Dog Egg was terrified. He wiped his hand on the furniture and hid in the gap between the bed and the window.</p>
 <p>A person walked in humming a song, and the movement of his foot on the floor was clearly visible to Dog Egg. At that moment, he was very afraid and his tears kept flowing while he held his mouth with his hands. He wanted to scream for his grandma very loudly at the time.</p>
 <p>Then, he heard the sound of something being cut. After that, the person left. Dog Egg quietly looked up to make sure the person was gone.</p>
 <p>However, he didn't know whether the person was gone or still in the house. He got under the bed on his stomach and didn’t dare move an inch.</p>
 <p>The house was extremely quiet. He could clearly hear the sound of cooking in the kitchen, and then the sound of slurping, like someone was eating noodles. In the midst of that, the person said a few things. He thought they said, “Fucking bitch, I told you not to touch that!”</p>
 <p>Then, there was the rustling kind of sound which lasted for a while. After, there was the sound of something burning and crackling. There was a very intense smoke, so Dog Egg covered his mouth and dared not to cough.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t sure how long it took, but finally there was a loud closing noise outside and then the room was quiet. It was then that Dog Egg finally dared to come out of his hiding place. He found Aunty Pingzi’s leg had a piece of meat cut off. It was very red and scary.</p>
 <p>He shook her a few more times. When he thought about how the bad guy might return, he quickly opened the door and ran away.</p>
 <p>Later, he met his grandma, who had walked into the neighborhood to find him at the time.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue turned off the recording. Most of this recording was similar to the police's speculation based on the crime scene, except for the rustle heard by Dog Egg.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi called, "Dog Egg, let’s go home!"</p>
 <p>When they got home, Dog Egg was going to go back to play the game again. Chen Shi grabbed him and asked, "Do you want to eat ice cream again tomorrow?"</p>
 <p>Dog Egg nodded.</p>
 <p>"Then, answer one of uncle’s questions. You don't have to talk. Just nod or shake your head."</p>
 <p>Dog Egg hesitated, but nodded.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi walked to the curtain and rubbed it with his hands, asking, "Is this the rustle you heard?"</p>
 <p>Dog Egg shook his head.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi tore a page off the calendar and rubbed it in his hand, "What about this?"</p>
 <p>Dog Egg still shook his hand.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue took out a pencil and wrote on a book. Chen Shi said, "This?"</p>
 <p>He shook his head.</p>
 <p>They tried everything in the room, but Dog Egg continued to shake his head. Chen Shi touched his chin to think out of habit and he felt the stubble that he hadn’t shaved in days. He immediately understood and went to the bathroom. He put on shaving cream and then shaved his beard as he asked, “Was it this?”</p>
 <p>Dog Egg nodded desperately.</p>
 <p>"How long did the rustling sound last for? I’ll continue to shave now, and you count the time."</p>
 <p>After shaving his beard, Chen Shi asked, "Was it longer than this?"</p>
 <p>Dog Egg nodded.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi laughed. "Get it! I get it! That's it!"</p>
 <p>He immediately sent a few messages to the task force. He didn't sleep very much that night. He woke up the next day and rushed to the bureau. Peng Sijue asked, "What did you send in the group last night? Why should we investigate cosmetics and wigs bought by the victims?”</p>
 <p>"Have you checked it?"</p>
 <p>"Captain Lin took someone to check it early in the morning. He takes your opinion very seriously these days."</p>
 <p>"Good pupil. How are you doing on your end?"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue held up a document. "DNA comparison results. The blood on the banknote and Lu Zhendong's DNA are a 100% match!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi closed his eyes and raised his head. "The moment when the truth is revealed, it's like seeing the truth of the universe!"</p>
 <p>"Someone who didn’t get any sleep might not think that way.”</p>
 <p>"Are you talking about me? Are you free to accompany me to the crime scene?"</p>
 <p>After getting in the car, Chen Shi took out a can of Red Bull from the glove box and gave it to Peng Sijue. Peng Sijue opened the can and asked, "The kidnapping case five years ago was all planned by Lu Zhendong?"</p>
 <p>"No, the original investigation was not wrong. The kidnapping case was self-directed by Lu Zhenjie, but Lu Zhendong pushed the boat along the current and bought one of them, turning the fake kidnapping into a real kidnapping!”</p>
 <p>"What’s his motivation behind that?"</p>
 <p>"In order to get the love of his father! Isn't it strange that I say this? Put another way, do you know how much Old Man Lu loves his second son? Looking at the past news, we know how ridiculous his second son was. But no matter what he did, the old man could just laugh it off. But he doesn't seem to do the same with Lu Zhendong, as if he wasn’t Old Man Lu’s biological son. He gave him various strict requirements… Their father’s favoritism caused this tragedy.”</p>
 <p>"Fathers shouldn't play a role in spoiling children."</p>
 <p>"That's right. This pair of brother’s mother is the father’s ex-wife from three marriages ago, and he was never part of their growth at all.”</p>
 <p>When they got to the crime scene, the place had already been cleaned briefly. The blood was gone and some plated labels had been placed around the house. Chen Shi first verified Dog Egg’s testimony. Sure enough, he could find the traces from Dog Egg hiding under the bed.</p>
 <p>Then, he opened the toilet. The ashes in the toilet were gone, but there were still marks on the inner wall of the toilet.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked, "What about the burnt items?"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue replied. "We took it back for testing. There are no clues, so I threw it in the evidence room."</p>
 <p>"Dog Egg said that he heard rustling that night. After repeated inquiries, I have determined that the rustle was the sound of shaving."</p>
 <p>"Shaving?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took out a trash can, put a plastic bag in it, and then unscrewed the pipes under the wash basin. As the sewage flowed out, some fine hair fell into the bag. Of course, this was only a small part. There was much more where that came from.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took the absorbent paper from the kitchen and put a thick layer down before pouring out the contents of the plastic bag.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue pulled out a fold-out magnifying glass and began to study the hairs. "The cuts are neat and smooth. It was shaved off. Besides the beard, there are some other hairs… This needs to be brought back for further tests.”</p>
 <p>"Why not reason first?"</p>
 <p>"In terms of thickness and how it bends, this should be... Leg hair! Chest hair!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "The killer carefully killed the victims, carefully shaved the hair on his body, and then burned some of the cosmetics and wigs. In fact, the purpose of burning these things was to cover up one thing: He took some of them away.”</p>
 <p>"Shaving, wigs, cosmetics, don't tell me..."</p>
 <p>"The murderer is dressed as a woman!" Chen Shi concluded. "That's why we searched so hard and found nothing for it."</p>
