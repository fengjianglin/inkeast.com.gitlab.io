 <p>Lin Qiupu questioned, "So, you lied for her?"</p>
 <p>Dr. Li bowed his head in guilt. "It rained early this month. She ran to my house to find me in the rain. When we met, she cried. My heart hurt so much. She asked me if I was willing to do anything for her. I obviously said yes. She then asked me to make a fake surgery record on May 20th and asked me not to tell anyone afterwards.”</p>
 <p>"You didn't think that this was used to forge an alibi back then?"</p>
 <p>"Alibi?" Dr. Li was so frightened that he broke out in cold sweat. "You mean… You mean... She killed someone?”</p>
 <p>"How did she lie to you back then?"</p>
 <p>"She only said that she had a secret. If I could help her once, she was willing to share it with me... Listening to this, I felt that she might be willing to accept me, so of course I was willing to do it!"</p>
 <p>"You didn’t express any doubts even when the police questioned you afterwards?"</p>
 <p>"I asked her, but she asked me to not say anything. She said that we were grasshoppers on a rope, which indicated that we would start dating once we get through this… Now that I think about it, she was probably lying to me again. But I really didn’t dare to tell the truth to the police because I molested that girl. Molesting minors would send me to jail!”</p>
 <p>"It’s true that you’ll have to go to jail." Lin Qiupu sighed.</p>
 <p>"I was bewitched by her though! I didn’t do it willingly." The doctor burst into tears.</p>
 <p>"Listen, you can help us so that we can help you fight for leniency."</p>
 <p>The doctor covered his face and wept, "I didn't kill anyone or set fire to anything. I’ve been honest and followed all the rules since childhood. Why should I go to jail? Wouldn’t my career be ruined?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu felt that the doctor was pretty unlucky to be used by Yi Qing's beauty and manipulation. He fell into a trap and didn't know he was an accomplice to a crime.</p>
 <p>A woman like Yi Qing, full of intellect and charm, appearing in the life of an ordinary doctor was akin to the arrival of an angel. Lin Qiupu thought that if it were him, he wouldn’t be able to guarantee that he would act completely rationally either.</p>
 <p>"Is there anything else you’d like to add?" Lin Qiupu asked. "You have no intention of committing a crime. It would be good for you to provide more clues."</p>
 <p>The doctor thought about it and said, "The woman told me to steal medicine or needles and give her patient information."</p>
 <p>"When was this? Why did she ask you to do this?"</p>
 <p>"Since last October. The stolen drugs weren’t anything illegal. They were just regular prescription drugs. She would tell me the reason at first, but then she gradually stopped talking about her motives. As soon as I finished my mission, she would reward me, which was just praising me. Or, she’d promise to accompany me to dinner, but my heart was already so happy that it could explode."</p>
 <p>The doctor successively talked about these things, but it didn't sound like it related to the case itself. Chen Shi listened from outside and said, "Yi Qing asked him to do these small bad things to consistently lower the threshold of his conscience. These are all to pave the way for him to sexually assault Zhao Puyang and deceive the police."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said in surprise, "An adult was actually controlled by this method?"</p>
 <p>"People's degeneration is gradual, regardless of whether they are adults or children." Chen Shi remembered Gu You's analysis of Yi Qing. "She really does have a controlling personality. The orphanage is her test field. She knows how to control a person well."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi remembered that when he was in "Black Honey", everyone enthusiastically discussed the mind control technique called "Mentalism" and read the work of mind control expert Derren Brown. This was where Yi Qing would have learned it.</p>
 <p>Controlling the consciousness was not as mysterious as hypnosis. It was used in daily advertising, games, film, and television. Players in the dating scene also use one or two techniques, although they wouldn’t know the scientific terms for the techniques.</p>
 <p>If a person learned it and consciously used it to do bad things, then that was truly horrifying.</p>
 <p>Therefore, "Black Honey" that taught Yi Qing this knowledge also bore a great responsibility.</p>
 <p>The interrogation lasted until 1:00AM and everyone was very sleepy. The doctor confessed everything he could and he begged Lin Qiupu not to sentence him. Lin Qiupu made a gesture in silence and let his subordinates detain him first.</p>
 <p>The police went to the orphanage the next day and Gu You was unexpectedly here. When she saw Chen Shi and the others, she waved to say hello.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue looked left and right. "Who is she saying hello to?" Then, she noticed that Peng Sijue was walking behind them, and Peng Sijue looked away slightly awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "I’ll go over and speak to her a little."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Gu You, "Why are you still here?"</p>
 <p>"The investigation is one thing. The psychological assistance for the children organized by our clinic isn’t fake. We haven't finished yet! Don’t worry, we won’t interfere with your investigation."</p>
 <p>After Chen Shi returned, Lin Dongxue looked at him suspiciously. "What did you two talk about?"</p>
 <p>"We’re neighbors, so of course we’d have to say hello. She’s working on providing psychological assistance for the children."</p>
 <p>"Hmph, I was thinking that since there’s a beauty who understands psychology living next to you, should I move over to your place?"</p>
 <p>"You look pretty cute when you’re jealous. I’d welcome you with open arms."</p>
 <p>"Wait for our relationship to become official first!" Lin Dongxue smiled slyly.</p>
 <p>The group found Yi Qing reading a story to the children, who asked Lin Qiupu with a smile, "Are you looking for me?"</p>
 <p>"Let's talk alone!"</p>
 <p>"Go to the yard to play first. Teacher will come over soon." Yi Qing said gently to the children.</p>
 <p>After the children left, Lin Qiupu said solemnly, "Yi Qing, we suspect that you’re related to two murder cases. I hope you can cooperate with the investigation."</p>
 <p>"I’ll cooperate fully."</p>
 <p>"At noon on May 20th, where did you and Zhao Puyang go after leaving the orphanage?"</p>
 <p>Yi Qing slowly said, "We went out to do some business."</p>
 <p>"Didn't you previously say that Zhao Puyang had an appendicitis operation?"</p>
 <p>"Sorry, I lied to you. Zhao Puyang and I had some personal matters to deal with. That's all."</p>
 <p>"That is, you have no alibi."</p>
 <p>Yi Qing shrugged. "You can't prove that I was anywhere else either."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu sneered and summoned a forensic officer with a cotton swab in hand. Lin Qiupu said, "We need to collect your DNA."</p>
 <p>Yi Qing was very cooperative, but Zhao Puyang outside didn't cooperate at all. She was kicking and beating the police. Yi Qing stepped out to comfort her until she was obedient.</p>
 <p>The police collected all the shoe prints and clothing fibers owned by the two and took them back for identification.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu had been questioning Yi Qing the entire time and she remained calm. However, she refused to say what she did that afternoon. Lin Dongxue whispered to Chen Shi, "Isn't this woman digging her own grave? The police will only doubt her more."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi didn’t answer, but he believed that Yi Qing was prepared to push Zhao Puyang into being her scapegoat. This was her last card.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue called them and after hearing the results, Lin Qiupu's eyes widened slightly. Peng Sijue said, "The fingerprints and DNA found are only of Zhao Puyang's and the footprints are hers as well. The other vague shoe print didn’t have a matching sample."</p>
 <p>Yi Qing observed Lin Qiupu's expression and sneered.</p>
