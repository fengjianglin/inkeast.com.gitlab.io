 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was slightly startled and asked, "Was there no security guard on duty last night?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, the security guard said that Old Wang was on duty and had left early in the morning. The keys were left on the table and the TV was still on. Maybe he was too sleepy so he went back to sleep."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Inquire about his address and go over to confirm... Xiaodong should go!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong was surprised. "Why me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Because I’m playing favorites."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have nothing to say!" Xu Xiaodong said before he left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi stopped him. "By the way, go to the property managers and take the hard drive back to see if it can be restored."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue took the opportunity to take a good look at the body. She said, "It's a pity to die at such a young age. Could it be a crime of passion?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’re not sure yet. But I think the murderer is probably someone in his social circle."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It would be good if it’s not a serial killer."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Peng Sijue said, "Let's protect the crime scene first. Old Chen, go to my car and get a body bag. We’ll take the body back."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While they were talking, a car stopped outside. They could hear crying from inside the car before the door was even open. A &nbsp;neatly-dressed middle-aged couple rushed out of the car and ran straight towards the building. The woman howled, "My son!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who had informed the family?" Chen Shi asked in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No one notified them... Maybe it was a neighbor!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Block them and stop them from damaging the scene."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as the couple saw what it was like in the house, they cried even more tempestuously. Lin Dongxue comforted them, "My condolences. We are criminal police and we are investigating this case at the moment."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who is so cruel as to kill my son? It was his 30th birthday as well. Why? Why?! If I’d had known, I’d have called him back home yesterday! It’s my fault! My fault!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mother of the deceased cried continuously and kept using her handkerchief to pound her husband's arm. The husband whispered and soothed her while holding back tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The most uncomfortable thing for the police was facing the family of the victims. No matter how much they comforted them, it wouldn't ease the sorrow of the couple. Chen Shi reached out and closed the door. After the woman had finished crying, he said, "Sorry that I still have to ask you questions in this moment of sorrow, but it’s for investigating the case..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, you can ask!" The deceased's mother said. "We will cooperate fully with the police. As long as we can bring the murderer to justice, we are willing to spend whatever money it takes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's not convenient to talk here. Why don’t we change the location?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The four of them went to a place in the neighborhood where there were stone chairs. After sitting down, the woman was still wiping away tears endlessly. Chen Shi asked, "How should we address you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My surname is Song. My wife’s surname is He.” The husband replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"When was the last time you saw your son?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The husband and wife glanced at each other, and the husband said, "Three or four days ago, it was probably the weekend. Our family has the habit of having a meal together every weekend no matter how busy we are."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you a family of three?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We also have a younger son who is currently studying in university, but it’s summer vacation and he’s staying at home!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The woman cried, "When I received the call, it was like a bolt from the blue. We haven't even told him yet! I don't know how to break it to him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What did you talk about when you last met?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The husband recalled, "We talked about some work-related stuff..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wife said, "Both the father and the son are dentists. I couldn’t even join in on their conversation when they talk about their profession.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Judging from the manner in which the husband and wife spoke, the couple seemed to be very affectionate with each other. Chen Shi continued to ask, "What else?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We talked about some movies and games, mainly because the brothers were interested in them."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Anything else?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"And..." The husband recalled, "Oh, yes, Yuwen seems to have acquired a girlfriend. I said that he should bring her home for a meal together when he had the chance, but he said that the relationship wasn’t confirmed yet."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Was there anything else?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, his wife said, "He said that his younger cousin Wanjun was coming back to the country in two days and a reunion was planned."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah yes, that did come up. She’s the child of a relative who is studying abroad."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue wrote it all down and asked, "Has he had any conflicts with anyone?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Both the husband and wife said no. Chen Shi remembered the information revealed by the wife and asked, "Last night was his thirtieth birthday?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I want to see his circle of friends on WeChat and Weibo. Although we found his mobile phone at the scene, it was destroyed by the murderer."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The husband took out his mobile phone and showed it to Chen Shi. Last night, the deceased had posted something for his circle of friends. A black forest cake topped with candles that had numbers on them. From the background, it should have been his workplace. The following was written: "Thank you for everyone’s blessings, please have some cake!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Going back to his old posts, they found that the deceased didn’t post frequently. Most of them consisted of him sharing some interesting jokes. Chen Shi asked, "Was Song Yuwen a very cheerful person?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The husband sighed. "Yes, my son's character has always been confident and cheerful. Since childhood, he’s been the pistachio<span id="footnote-ref-f02e"><a href="#footnote-f02e">[1]</a></span> in the family. Although he’s not very smart, he had a good trait. He didn’t like to admit defeat. When he was a child, he took second place in his exams and couldn’t sleep because of it. His results have been very good all these time and we basically haven’t had to worry about it. At first, he wanted to study computers, but I asked him to study dentistry, as the employment prospects of this field are very good. He protested, saying that the field was very boring. However, he obediently did as I asked later. After he went into this line of work, he has done quite well. He’s now the director of the clinic!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What about his younger brother?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"His younger brother, Song Yuqiang, and his older brother are like opposites. He was quite lively and smart when he was young, but he didn't like to study. I don’t know how many tutors we’ve hired. Later, when he entered the period of rebellion, we were worried to death. I had hoped that he would become a dentist as well, but I couldn't control him. As a result, he applied to major in art. Of course, as a parent, I will still support him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do the brothers have a good relationship with each other?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Very good. They’ve played together since childhood. The brothers always told each other anything before we found out."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After writing down the information, the wife grabbed Chen Shi's hand and said, "Officers, you must catch the murderer and give us justice."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes, you can be rest assured!" Chen Shi comforted her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After saying goodbye to the sad couple, Chen Shi said, "How do you feel about this family?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It seems to be a family with a strict parenting style and the family background is good. The couple is also very loving. In short, it’s a happy family... Unfortunately, it was ruined by this incident. The murderer is really abominable. Do you think it could be jealousy?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How would we know right now? Chen Shi said out loud as he pondered over it. "Is there any special meaning in his dying on his birthday?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two went back to help Peng Sijue take the body to the car. When the three drove back towards the bureau and saw the main building of the bureau, Lin Dongxue said, "Aiya, did we forget something?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Fuck, we forgot Xiaodong... Forget it, forget it. He has his legs and can walk back himself."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The body was sent for autopsy. Chen Shi asked&nbsp;</span><span>Lin</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Qiupu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;for a few people and began investigating the deceased, his interpersonal relationships, recent expenses, and communication records before his death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At noon, Chen Shi proposed that they go out to eat claypot rice<span id="footnote-ref-5814"><a href="#footnote-5814">[2]</a></span>. Lin Dongxue asked, "Why hasn't Xiaodong come back yet?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this time, Xu Xiaodong called them and asked anxiously, "Where are you guys? Hurry back. I’ve found a second body!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What? Where did you find it? Are you the only one over there?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It was found in a nearby river. It may be the missing security guard. It isn’t just me. There are several comrades from the nearby police station."</span></p>
