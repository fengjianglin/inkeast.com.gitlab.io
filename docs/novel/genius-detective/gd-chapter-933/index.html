 <p>The bullet passed through Nguyen Hui's shoulder. After going to the hospital for emergency treatment, the police immediately brought her back and began the interrogation.</p>
 <p>Facing the interrogators, Nguyen Hui looked pitiful, and even cried, but she refused to give anything up.</p>
 <p>"It's the same result again." Chen Shi said, "These professional criminals are all hardheaded."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue comforted him, "When my brother was an interrogator, this kind of thing was normal. These people knew that they couldn't escape from their crimes, and they’d meet the same end whether they talked or not, so they would simply die with their lips zipped. Some people had simpler motives and would talk when they entered prison in exchange for some benefits. The credit would then then be given to the prison officers."</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nguyen Hui seemed to be saying something on the monitor screen. The interrogator busied himself writing it down, and then picked up the interphone.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi's cell phone rang, and the interrogator said, "Captain, she confessed where the bodies had been abandoned. They are in..."</p>
 <p>After listening, Chen Shi was both heartened and disappointed. What was heartening was that they finally had some results. What was disappointing was - "In the end, not a single victim was saved."</p>
 <p>"Didn't we save one? Although he lost his stomach."</p>
 <p>"I'll arrange for someone to bring the bodies back so that everyone doesn't have to work overtime tonight. After&nbsp;busying&nbsp;ourselves for a few days, we can finally rest for a while..." Chen Shi turned around to leave.</p>
 <p>"Hey, Captain, it's 5:00, should we..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi slapped his forehead. "You go and inform them. I’ll go to the office to change my clothes."</p>
 <p>When he went to the office, Chen Shi took off his police uniform and put on his civilian clothes. When he was about to turn off the lights, he found a piece of paper on his desk.</p>
 <p>When he picked it up, Chen Shi's eyes widened, and he quickly ran to the Information Department to ask them to check for a certain person.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the results on the screen, Chen Shi muttered to himself, "That's it! So it was like that!"</p>
 <p>"Captain, Captain." Lin Dongxue's voice came from the corridor.</p>
 <p>"I'm here." Chen Shi walked out.</p>
 <p>"Why did you leave the office without saying anything? Let's go!"</p>
 <p>"Look at this." Chen Shi stuffed the DNA identification result in his hand into hers.</p>
 <p>"No way!!!" Lin Dongxue's astonishment was beyond description. "The blood on the kk’s sole really came from one of the victims. Liao Chunhuang is the person behind the scenes. He does have money, underworld connections, and he also knows of the ritual. But... what about the motive?"</p>
 <p>"What do you think is the point of resurrecting a person for only one day?"</p>
 <p>"Don't be mysterious and just tell me."</p>
 <p>"The most significant meaning of the one-day resurrection is the judicial significance. For example, if I killed a person and that person was resurrected, even if he was resurrected for only one minute, my murder charge would be invalidated judicially."</p>
 <p>"Could it be that the person Liao Chunhuang wanted to resurrect was the one his wife killed? His wife’s elder brother?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, Xu Rongrong's elder brother Xu Song was born on February 19th, 1973. We actually hadn't thought of it even though it had already appeared in front of our eyes. It took a few detours before we discovered this. If kk hadn’t stepped on this drop of blood by mistake, everyone would still be in the dark!" The feeling of sudden realizations always brought a kind of thorough rejuvenation. Chen Shi wondered if his thinking had become dulled after spending two months in the detention center since he had only figured it out now.</p>
 <p>"Everyone hasn't gotten off work yet. I'll call them, and we’ll prepare to arrest him!"</p>
 <p>"No, no..." Chen Shi considered. "This drop of blood found on kk can't prove where it came from. When we go tonight, we will search carefully and find this key evidence. Go to Old Peng to get some cotton swabs and reagents... Let everyone have a good time during the Mid-Autumn Festival. If they were called back after we said they could get off work, how much would they hate me in their hearts?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue also smiled. "Should we bring a gun?"</p>
 <p>"No, Liao Chunhuang still doesn’t know&nbsp;that&nbsp;we know. There won’t be any risk tonight."</p>
 <p>"To be on the safe side, I'll still carry a gun."</p>
 <p>"That’s okay too."</p>
 <p>Tonight was the Mid-Autumn Festival. People from all walks of life were preparing to go home and reunite with their loved ones. There was a round of ice in the sky<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-933#footnote-68e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a>, casting down endless clear and bright light, but the human world was crowded. The cars on the road moved forward slowly like the inspiration of a writer suffering writer’s block. kk called five or six times to hurry him up. He was going crazy. Chen Shi couldn’t do anything though. It’s not like he could fly over. He kept tapping the steering wheel anxiously.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue took out her mobile phone and scrolled through her WeChat Moments. "Xiaodong has already gone home to eat mooncakes... Damn, who is my brother having dinner with? Is it a blind date again?... Someday when I see Captain Peng’s Moments post, the sun will really rise from the west."</p>
 <p>"He’s posted something before!"</p>
 <p>"Has he?"</p>
 <p>"I remember that in 2015 he posted, 'If I lack the real answer, it's because I still don't know what to ask.' Just like a lunatic, I only found out that he had a problem at work when I asked him about it."</p>
 <p>"At that time, you were still Song Lang."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, I never thought that in four years, I would be sitting in the same car with the most beautiful woman in the world."</p>
 <p>Looking at each other and smiling, they gave each other a peck, then kissed passionately. Lin Dongxue whispered, "My shirt is coming off."</p>
 <p>"Are you serious?"</p>
 <p>At this time, a horn sounded from behind, and Chen Shi hurriedly sat properly and continued driving. Lin Dongxue said, "Haha, it works. This trick works too well."</p>
 <p>"Drive the car by making out?"</p>
 <p>"Stupid, I mean Murphy's law. As soon as you go for a shower, the delivery will come. When you and your friends make an appointment to go window-shopping, something will happen at the bureau today. As soon as you start up a game at work, the boss will appear immediately. It’s always the case."</p>
 <p>"True, true, I’ve learned it!"</p>
 <p>After all the difficulties, they finally got to the hotel. kk, who had been waiting in the lobby, was so anxious that his stomping had nearly broken the floorboards. "Have you guys been giving birth? You’re so late. Hurry up. We’ve been waiting just for you."</p>
 <p>"Waiting for this?" Chen Shi raised the newspaper in his hand.</p>
 <p>"Go upstairs! Go upstairs!"</p>
 <p>When they got to that floor, Old Man Lu was thumping his cane with his face as gloomy as an overcast sky. Master Liao was sitting next to him. The two "sons" were just standing behind. When he saw Chen Shi, he thumped the cane, making “dong, dong” noises. "Song Lang, are you doing this on purpose? We had told you in advance but you took so long. You need to take responsibility if we miss the auspicious time."</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry." Chen Shi answered perfunctorily. "The road conditions were really poor today."</p>
 <p>Glancing at the traffic outside the window, Old Man Lu's grievances subsided a little, but he still complained, "Why do all those poor people take holidays? It’ll affect the mood of rich people like us during the Mid-Autumn Festival."</p>
 <p>"It's best for all the poor to die so that there are only rich people left in the world. That would be wonderful." kk said sarcastically.</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu glanced at kk. "You brought your pet with you?"</p>
 <p>"I..." kk was about to fly into a fit of rage, but was stopped by Chen Shi who whispered, "There’s a plan afoot tonight!"</p>
 <p>He handed "Zhou Xiao's murder weapon" over to Old Man Lu. He looked it over, raised his bald eyebrows suspiciously, and asked, "It’s this worn-out knife?"</p>
 <p>"Let me see." Master Liao took it. He was suddenly startled, said an incantation as he gestured, pushing his pinched fingers against the blade a few times. "This thing has an intense killing aura, and there are seventy-three wronged spirits crying and wailing. It must be the murder weapon the demon used!"</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu nodded in satisfaction and made a gesture, "Give him the money and let him get lost!"</p>
 <p>"No, I don't want money. I just want to observe what Master Liao does. Honestly speaking, I have never seen half immortals even though I’m this old."</p>
 <p>"Hehehehe&nbsp;hahahaha!" Mater Liao laughed rhythmically. "This layman is questioning my Taoist skills, so let him observe it. Also, I want to correct you. I am&nbsp;not half&nbsp;immortal. I’m an immortal that has been incarnated in a human body. Give me a little more respect. If I waved my hand, I&nbsp;could&nbsp;wipe out your whole police station."</p>
 <p>"Excuse me! Excuse me!" Chen Shi clasped his hands together. Looking at a person who was about to be arrested put up this farce was just like watching a clown.</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu held up a finger. "Song Lang, observing is one thing, but if you dare to mess with it, I’ll strangle you to death!"</p>
