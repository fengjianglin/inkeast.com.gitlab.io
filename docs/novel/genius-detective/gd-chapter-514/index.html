 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi rushed out of the interrogation room, leaned against the wall, and wanted to vomit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue was also pale. Chen Shi asked, "Do you want to go to the hospital to wash your stomach?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"All the food I ate yesterday has arrived in the small intestine. Can you wash that?" Lin Dongxue said in denial. "Impossible. How is that possible? Absolutely impossible!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he wanted to have breakfast, Chen Shi had no appetite anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhang Farong had just said that the meat was actually human flesh, and the source was even more exaggerated. That is, it was Zhang Hao's father's flesh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "But if it's human meat... We should have been able to tell. The taste and texture of beef is different from other meat."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go for a test!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing this request, Peng Sijue flatly refused. "The meat is composed of protein and fat. Even the mass spectrometer can't tell what kind of meat it is. I can't test it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ll think of a way!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi ran to the cafeteria to borrow a pot, then ran back to the forensics department. Peng Sijue scolded him right away. "Don't do that here!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's about whether I can eat meat deliciously in the future. Have a little sympathy!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So? What does it matter? Aren't human flesh and beef all protein?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Captain Peng is so open-minded. If it’s human flesh, would you come and taste it?" When talking about human flesh, Chen Shi wanted to vomit again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue whispered, "No way. It tasted like beef."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Peng Sijue said, "Do you know there’s something called beef paste?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"An additive made from beef bones and fat. It can be used to make other meats taste like beef."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing this, Lin Dongxue stopped being calm. In fact, Chen Shi had already thought about it, but he didn't want to say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The price of beef is high. In order to reduce costs, some stores would sell pork as beef. Beef paste can cause pork to have the same taste and texture as beef.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There are plasticizers in the cake, washing powder in deep-fried fritters, and a drop of incense is widely used in mala hotpot restaurants. Chen Shi knew these well. Sometimes when you go out to eat, as long as you don’t see it, you’d pretend it’s clean. After all, Chinese people’s constitution was relatively resilient from eating various poisons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, if the food they ate yesterday really was human flesh, it would really be unbearable!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He heated the pot with a gas stove, put the meat filling into it and the smell of beef soon wafted out. Lin Dongxue smelled and looked at it again. "The texture and smell are both like that of beef!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Have you ever seen human meat filling?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I guess there’s something mixed into the meat stuffing. Let's go to the scene to check. If the shop uses beef paste, then the meat has to be tested."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two went to the Zhangji Soup Noodle House. His wife was packing up the shop. When she saw that the police had come back, she asked with concern, "When will my husband be back? This situation wasn’t his fault. Why should he be detained?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"After all, it’s bodily harm caused by a weapon. We have to figure everything out before letting him go. I hope you understand."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah, if he was really put in jail, how would my son and I live from now on?! The soup in this shop is an ancestral recipe and only he knows the recipe. Without him, we can't do business."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Relax, it won't be dragged on for too long... We are here to ask you about something else. Where is the source of the meat in this shop?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Meat source? I don't know very well. It’s the chefs who buy it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is there any contact information for them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, several chefs were called to the store. When asked about the source of meat, they were a little vague. They only said that they bought it from the vegetable market, but they couldn’t produce any evidence. Chen Shi asked a different question. “Do you guys use beef paste?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No... No..." The masters denied it in unison with a suspicious attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, you all can head back first!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue began to search around the store. They finally found a few green tins in a drawer at the bottom. They opened one of them and smelled a strong beef smell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue's face changed color. "I will never go out to eat again."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi looked at these items in a daze and suddenly said, "Why am I so stupid? If there’s such a thing, we just need to check where that person is."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He asked Zhang Hao's wife, "I want to know something. Where is Zhang Hao's father?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His wife looked embarrassed. "He... He... Went missing."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How long has he been missing?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Wait a minute." The wife ran upstairs and brought a stack of paper down. It was a printed missing persons notice, which said that Zhang Fade went missing in the beginning of&nbsp;</span><span>2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It also mentioned his appearance at the time of disappearance, the family’s contact information, etc.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue called the police station and then whispered the result to Chen Shi. Chen Shi said, "The police station has no record of this. Your father-in-law is missing. You only posted missing persons notices but didn’t call the police?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know much about it. My husband did it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Your husband did it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no, I mean, he printed them all." The wife looked a little flustered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He’s been missing for two years now. Is there no news of him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wife shook her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi seemed to understand something. Zhang Farong knew about this matter but kept it secret so as to blackmail his nephew. His instinct was correct. The abnormal attitude of the parties indicated that there might be a murder case behind it all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking back, this store was closed for two years before reopening again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue gave Chen Shi a look and the two went outside. Lin Dongxue said, "Zhang Farong's confession and Zhang Hao's confession don’t match."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"About what happened last night?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Zhang Hao said that when he saw a man crouching on the ground, he was scared and he defended himself with a knife. However, Zhang Farong said that at that time, he shouted Zhang Hao's name and the other party had already recognized him, but he still cut him with the knife."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where is Zhang Farong's injury?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Behind..." Lin Dongxue pointed to her own shoulder blades. "Here. There are two more knife wounds on his back."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi thought, "Since it’s a relative, when the first knife wound was made, the other party would definitely speak out. Adding two more may have been to murder him so he couldn’t talk."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Murder? Are you saying that Zhang Hao really killed his father? But Zhang Farong has no evidence!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There’s no evidence, but he knows and blackmails him this way. This is a threat!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No wonder you scared him in the interrogation room back then. Do you suspect there’s a case within?" Lin Dongxue looked back at the old shop. "Didn't you say you’re afraid that you won't be able to eat breakfast in this shop tomorrow?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi smiled. "Compared to soup noodles, the truth is more attractive to me... Go and search again!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue asked Zhang Hao's wife to take her leave first. The two conducted a carpet search in the store. There was nothing suspicious on the first floor. They were considering whether to go to the second floor when Chen Shi noticed that the wall behind the freezer was a bit abnormal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He asked Lin Dongxue to help him move the freezer aside. The wallpaper there bubbled out slightly. He tapped it with his fingers to find that it was hollow inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi made a decisive decision and picked up a kitchen knife to scratch the wallpaper off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was only a wooden board under the wallpaper. Lin Dongxue's was a little uncomfortable. Chen Shi lifted the board up, revealing a hole in the back. When he reached in, his expression changed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He pulled out a burnt bone. Judging from the size, it was likely to be that of a tibia.</span></p>
