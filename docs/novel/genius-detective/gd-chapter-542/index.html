 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three of them came over and saw that there really were a few drops of blood on the ground. Chen Shi took a photo and then took a sample. The blood should have dripped on the ground while the murderer was hiding there with the weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They checked the alley again. Chen Shi looked at the gradually darkening sky. "Aiya, did you notice who hadn’t slept well among those people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I think that they all had red eyes. It should be because they had been drinking... Do you think that the murderer hadn't slept all night after killing them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"In the past, there was a case that was solved that way. It was very extraordinary. After committing murder, they’d be in a state of high tension and excitement. At the same time, they’d be worried that they hadn’t handled the scene well, leaving clues behind. The first time that people kill someone, they would usually have insomnia for the first three days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where did the case take place?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"‘Gushi Hui’<span id="footnote-ref-dba9"><a href="#footnote-dba9">[1]</a></span>! But the next time you see them, you should take a good look and see who doesn’t look well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You really suspect that group of people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What’s your opinion?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"From the scene, this was a premeditated murder. The murderer chose the day of 918, put the deceased in Japanese military uniforms and made them kneel as if apologizing, indicating that they wanted to cover up their true motives. It may have nothing to do with those bunch of drunkards."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Speaking of military uniforms..." Chen Shi looked back and froze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It turned out that Xu Xiaodong was lying prone on the ground with his buttocks in the air as he sniffed a&nbsp;</span><span>clod</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;of dirt on the ground. The two couldn't help but laugh out loud. They walked over and Lin Dongxue asked, "What are you doing?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Major discovery! Major discovery!" Xu Xiaodong stood up. "Someone had vomited here, but it had been shoveled away. Look at the dirt marks on the ground."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi squatted down to check. Sure enough, there were traces of dirt having been shoveled away. He rubbed a little bit of residual liquid with his fingers and smelled it. "It’s indeed stomach acid. Take a sample!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I made a contribution!" Xu Xiaodong said elatedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don’t be too proud. This may not have been left behind during the murder." Lin Dongxue said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"By the way, where did the military uniforms come from?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"The crew said that they had been taken from the prop warehouse. Captain Lin checked the scene and there was no sign of the lock having been pried open. The prop master said that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fujiwara had the key."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He had the key?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The scenes with the two had finished filming that day, but the director said that he wanted to re-do a shot. The prop master went off to eat first, and the key was handed over to Fujiwara. He was asked to return the clothes to the warehouse once they were done.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who knew about this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Still asking... There are more people in this crew than expected."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s go to the warehouse and have a look."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three arrived at the prop warehouse and found that several trucks were emptying the warehouse. Chen Shi asked the staff at the scene. They said that the filming had been finished, so they weren’t renting the warehouse anymore.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who is the prop master?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I am!" An auntie walked over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We are the police and want to ask you about some things…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The prop master said that there were dozens of people present at the time. There were actors, directors, stage crew, and&nbsp;</span><span>costume</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">rs present. Chen Shi took out his book. "Which of these people were present?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"None of them were."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There are so many things in this prop warehouse, but you just gave the key to a featured extra?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh, this..." The prop master was very embarrassed. "Actually, we have been filming this movie for half a year. Everyone’s very familiar with each other and I wasn’t worried. The things in here aren’t worth much anyway.” She picked up a costume. "Look at the fabric of the clothing. These are only worn when filming. Who would steal them?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So there are no security cameras in here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I want to see the key."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The prop master handed over the key. There was a wooden tag with the words "Third Prop Warehouse" on it. There was a hole punched into the tag and the key hung from it. The prop master explained, "This is the key to the film and television base. When we rented it, we prepared a few spares. We’re going to hand them back soon after we’re done with them."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who has a spare?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Me. The costume designer and director also has one each.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After their questioning, Lin Dongxue asked, "Should we go to see the costume designer and the director? Since the filming has been finished, they’ll be leaving soon."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, let’s go and meet them!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After interviewing those two people, it was already 10:00 late at night and there wasn’t much progress. They went home at that point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next morning, Chen Shi woke up at 8:00 and found that Tao Yueyue was frying up some eggs. He said, "Yueyue, you don’t need to go to school today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"It’s September 18</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;in addition to the weekend. It’s so nice to have three days off in a row!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It would be nice if the murderer took holidays off."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncle Chen, what interesting case are you investigating?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Two Japanese people have died..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While eating breakfast, Chen Shi discussed the case with her. Tao Yueyue listened attentively. She said, "The murderer must hate the Japanese!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Didn’t you say that the murderer had left the alley at that time? Why did he have to go back to kill again? At that time, it was very dark. The one called Fujiwara ran down to check the condition of his friend, indicating that he didn’t see the murderer and the process of the murder. But why did the murderer have to go back and kill him as well? That’s why I think that the killer hates Japanese people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi didn’t take a child’s opinion seriously. "You wouldn’t be saying that the motive for murder is national enmity, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I think the person called Tamura must have deceived them!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why’s that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Just a feeling!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"By the way, it’s a holiday today. Do you want to visit the film and television city?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, there’s no point if I have to come with you to investigate the case. I might as well go and play by myself!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the way to the Public Security Bureau, Chen Shi considered Tao Yueyue's words and felt that she made some sense. The murderer's overly deliberate "performance" had made them ignore the motive of "hating Japanese" from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he didn’t consider private hatred. Tamura had spent six years in China and spoke good Chinese. The people around him didn’t know much about him. He might have actually deceived the murderer, so the murderer hated Japanese. Thus, Fujiwara became collateral damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the morning, he continued to investigate the case. When Lin Qiupu went to yesterday’s murder scene and saw something, he suddenly became furious. "Who did this?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The tree at the scene of the corpse abandonment had it’s bark scraped off and "Sasaki Kojirou<span id="footnote-ref-03ce"><a href="#footnote-03ce">[2]</a></span> and&nbsp;</span><span>Yekaojinju</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><span id="footnote-ref-9df2"><a href="#footnote-9df2">[3]</a></span> died here" had been written on it using a &nbsp;marker pen. These two names were the names of the Japanese characters in the drama that the deceased had played. The characters were both heinous Japanese officers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu ordered, "Find out who did it and teach them a lesson. They’re really too bold, actually daring to come over and mess up a murder scene!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This gave everyone a good laugh the whole morning, but they still needed to investigate. The "culprit" was a brave person but they hadn’t been very cautious. They had left footprints at the scene. The police came to the dorm that the featured extras had rented, and finally found the “culprit”, Lu Baoqiang.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Faced with the police's inquiry, Lu Baoqiang became scared, and said with shame, "I thought that these two Japanese deserved to die. I wanted to vent my hate so I woke up last night, and just..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu said, "You still think that you’re just?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I don't think these two were liked by either side. They deserved to die."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, come back with us!"</span></p>
