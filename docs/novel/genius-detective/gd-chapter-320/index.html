 <p>An hour later, Gu You arrived at the bureau. She was very willing to cooperate with the police's request. She explained, "Although I am not very good at hypnosis, I know a bit about it. In our clinic, we have also used hypnosis therapy. If you have any questions, you can ask me!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu asked straight away, "Can hypnosis kill people? I mean, used to order people to commit suicide?"</p>
 <p>"Under normal circumstances, no."</p>
 <p>"What about abnormal circumstances?"</p>
 <p>Gu You laughed, "I don't know how to put it in words. Let's try it out."</p>
 <p>"Yes, that’s a more direct way to go about it. Who will cooperate with Miss Gu?" Lin Qiupu looked around.</p>
 <p>Everyone was reluctant. It wasn't that they were afraid of the negative effects of hypnosis. The main reason was that it was a bit embarrassing to put themselves in the limelight. Gu You looked around and observed the expressions on everyone's faces. Finally, her eyes fell on Xu Xiaodong, saying, "This little brother, why don’t you come over?"</p>
 <p>"I... Forget it!" Xu Xiaodong smiled.</p>
 <p>"Xiaodong, go up. This is an order!" Lin Qiupu ordered.</p>
 <p>Gu You also said, "There are so many people, so there will be interference. Can I ask everyone to head outside first?"</p>
 <p>The crowd left for the corridor, but couldn't restrain their curiosity. They jostled one another to peek through the slit of the door, and saw Xu Xiaodong lying on the table. Gu You played soothing music on the computer, and started speaking to Xu Xiaodong.</p>
 <p>The whole process lasted for half an hour. Just as everyone was getting impatient, Xu Xiaodong suddenly opened the door and came out. The officers said in surprise, "It's over?" "This is the end of the hypnosis?" "What? Nothing happened! "</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong's expression was a little strange. He suddenly got down and started doing push-ups frantically. Gu You came out and smiled, "He has already been hypnotized by me."</p>
 <p>"He’s still in a hypnotized state?" Lin Dongxue said incredulously.</p>
 <p>"Yes, he can only hear my voice right now. If I don’t tell him to stop, he won’t stop… Officer Xu, stop!”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong suddenly stopped and remained motionless.</p>
 <p>Gu You walked over, took off her shoes and stood on his back. Everyone was stunned. They thought that it would break Xu Xiaodong's arms, but Gu You signaled to everyone to not be afraid, and then she said, "Please continue!"</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, Xu Xiaodong actually started to do push-ups supporting Gu You’s weight, as if he wasn’t affected at all.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that although Xu Xiaodong often worked out, he didn't have the strength to do this. After about ten push-ups, Gu You said, "Stop! Stand up."</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong stood up.</p>
 <p>Gu You explained, "When a person is in a hypnotic state, he can easily break his physical limits and do things that he can't normally do, but it does not mean that I can order him to do anything. For example, if I ask him to take off his clothes, he will wake up right away... Given the trouble of hypnotizing him again, I will not experiment with that."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, "So murder and suicide are impossible?"</p>
 <p>Gu You smiled slightly. "It can be done, but you can't give a direct order. For example, with regards to undressing..." Gu You gestured for everyone to be quiet. "Please take a step back and don't make a sound."</p>
 <p>Gu You said to Xu Xiaodong, "You are now in a dark house and it is getting hotter and hotter..."</p>
 <p>Sweat started beading on Xu Xiaodong’s face, which shocked the onlookers.</p>
 <p>Gu You's tone changed, "Do you smell that? The smell of sulfuric acid? It turns out that there is a lot of sulfuric acid on your clothes. They will burn your skin soon. Hurry and do something!"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong panicked. He started to take off his clothes while yelling. In front of everyone, he took off all the clothes on his upper body. As he was taking off his pants, Gu You suddenly snapped her fingers. Xu Xiaodong was stuck in place, with his hands on his pants like a statue. He asked, "Huh? What am I doing?"</p>
 <p>Many people were amazed by this scene and gasped in amazement. Some people couldn't even believe that it was true. They thought that Gu You and Xu Xiaodong had colluded to put on a show.</p>
 <p>Gu You patted his shoulder and said, "Thank you for your cooperation. You should get dressed!"</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong realized that he wasn't wearing a shirt, and quickly picked up his clothes and ran back into the conference room. His panicked actions caused a burst of laughter.</p>
 <p>Gu You said to Lin Qiupu, "Even if it is against his morals, it only needs to be contextualized in an appropriate situation and it will be fulfilled in an indirect way. It can be done! Some people think that hypnosis is very similar to a beta sleep state; people in this state will be dreaming constantly. The principle of hypnosis is that the dream is controlled by the hypnotist. People who are exposed to overly strong stimuli in their dreams will wake up, and this is the case with hypnosis as well."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, "If that’s the case, the five students in the school who committed suicide and the incident in the subway station may be the result of hypnosis?"</p>
 <p>"I think the point is not whether hypnosis can kill people, but how were they hypnotized? ... Can we move back to the conference room?"</p>
 <p>After everyone re-entered the meeting room, Gu You requested to watch the surveillance video of the subway station and the video of the student jumping off the building again. After watching it, Gu You suddenly became worried. Lin Qiupu shouted several times before she came back to her senses.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu asked, "You just said that the focus is on how they were hypnotized. Why is that?"</p>
 <p>"Does everyone think that hypnosis is lying on a recliner, with the hypnotherapist reading out some guiding words, and slowly inducing people into a hypnotic state? Also, that no matter who it is, as long as the method is appropriate, you can hypnotize them?"</p>
 <p>Many people nodded.</p>
 <p>Gu You explained, "Hypnosis is not so much a skill as it is a gifted talent. People who do not understand any psychology may be able to hypnotize others after simple training, but one thing is very important. Suggestion. The more suggestible the person is, the easier it is to hypnotize them, and vice versa. Not everyone can be hypnotized. Also, the psychological expectations of the person being hypnotized is very important. I just hypnotized Officer Xu because a consensus was reached in advance. He knew my identity and believed that I would not harm him. He knew that it was safe, so he lay down here to receive hypnosis and allowed his subconscious to accept my control... But if it was a stranger, or if one side wanted to maliciously hurt the other, under this psychological state of intense confrontation, hypnosis is almost impossible! Therefore, even if the murderer has a lot of skill in hypnosis, it can’t be used on people who distrust them."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu was disappointed for a while, when Gu You continued, "There is a legend that there is a violent type of hypnosis, which can even hypnotize enemies."</p>
