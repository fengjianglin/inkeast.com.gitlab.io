<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>This guy had a criminal record, so fingerprint identification confirmed his identity. His name was He Chaohua. He was arrested and imprisoned several times because of fraud. His longest-running fraud was when he was intimately involved with a rich woman. A year later, the rich woman died unexpectedly. He forged a will in order to hog the rich woman's assets. In the end, the shareholders of the rich woman's conglomerate saw through him and he was prosecuted for forging the will and suspected of murder. If it weren’t for insufficient evidence, he would probably still be in prison.</p>
 <p>"This man is a great actor. No wonder he could become the 'new son' of Old Man Lu." Chen Shi commented.</p>
 <p>"Should we investigate who his biological parents are and rule out the blood relationship between him and Old Master Lu?" Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>"It takes a lot of effort to find out. Let’s wait for Wang Haitao or this scammer to tell us themselves. Haii, Old Man Lu is now 80 years old, with a net worth of over 100 million. His personality is also willful. Such a target is simply the ultimate pursuit of a scammer. I'm not surprised he was deceived." Chen Shi picked up a folder, put the appraisal report inside it, wrote a note and pasted it on the folder. "Wait for kk and Little Worm’s progress on their side."</p>
 <p>Then he picked up the case closure report and went through it. "Couldn’t some challenging case come in?"</p>
 <p>"Is this what a captain should say? You should be thankful that the world is peaceful now, and a murderer like Zhou Xiao won’t ever show up again."</p>
 <p>"Dongxue, go call Old Peng over."</p>
 <p>"Oh."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue left for a while and then came back, saying, "Captain Peng is very busy now."</p>
 <p>"If Old Peng won't come, I’ll go there myself."</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he went straight to the forensic department. Peng Sijue was wearing a white coat and performing experiments in the laboratory. Chen Shi poured himself a cup of coffee and patted Peng Sijue on the shoulder. "Aiyo, what are you busying yourself with?"</p>
 <p>"You came here to cadge coffee again? You’re the captain now, can't you buy a machine for yourself?" Peng Sijue narrowed his eyes at him.</p>
 <p>"The coffee here has a special flavor. Do you want to have lunch together at noon?" Chen Shi asked with a grin.</p>
 <p>"No time."</p>
 <p>"Do you have to be so unfeeling?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi had heard that Peng Sijue often volunteered lately at the crematorium to perform autopsies on unclaimed corpses. Although the fact that Gu You was killed had been confirmed, her body still hadn’t been found. Peng Sijue still held a ray of hope.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi often hesitated over whether he should tell him where the corpse was buried, but he still chose not to tell him. He had experienced this kind of thing and knew how much impact it would bring.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi drank two cups of coffee and left silently. After finishing his work, Peng Sijue realized that he was missing, and asked the colleagues next to him, "When did that guy leave?"</p>
 <p>"Just now."</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue saw a paper boat that had been folded using discarded documents on the table. It must have been folded by Chen Shi while he was bored. On the boat was written: "See you at the pasta restaurant right outside at noon". Peng Sijue smiled and muttered to himself. "No matter if he’s surnamed Song or Chen, he’s just as annoying as ever.”</p>
 <p>After a day's work, Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue drove to the police academy. Tao Yueyue had just finished a day of training. Seeing them standing beside the drill-ground, she ran over happily and hugged Lin Dongxue.</p>
 <p>The three of them arrived at the canteen and Lin Dongxue said with emotion. "Wow, the canteen has completely changed. So many windows have been added."</p>
 <p>"The food still tastes bad." Tao Yueyue said.</p>
 <p>"Do you miss my cooking now?" Chen Shi teased.</p>
 <p>Freshmen in military uniforms could be seen everywhere. Everyone lined up for dinner and it was lively. Every scene evoked Lin Dongxue's youthful memories.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue said, "It was only in school that I found out how annoying boys are. They’re vulgar and self-righteous. Sister Lin, did you think this way back then as well?"</p>
 <p>"Back then? My biggest worries in the past came from boys, but it was directly caused by girls. The main reason was that I was too beautiful and pursued by many people. After that, I was ostracized by the girls. Haii, I can’t bear to look back on the past."</p>
 <p>"Why does it seem like I heard a touch of pride in there?" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"I'm not proud! I was actually annoyed to death at the time. Fortunately, I had one or two good friends. Yueyue, have you made friends here?"</p>
 <p>"Is that important?" Tao Yueyue asked in reply.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled bitterly. She was so much like his past self – basically a lone wolf. He said, "When you need to be slick and sly, you should act that way. It isn’t expensive to make friends in school. It is just a matter of a piece of soap and a bottle of mineral water."</p>
 <p>"I don’t have any friends yet, but I can talk about my hateful classmates for a full day and night."</p>
 <p>"Let's eat first!" Lin Dongxue suggested.</p>
 <p>No matter where she went, Lin Dongxue always made a lot of heads turn. When she passed by the boys, these hormonal youngsters opened their mouths with a “wow”, and their acne-covered faces followed Lin Dongxue’s movements like sunflowers following the sun.</p>
 <p>It's true that being too eye-catching does bring about distress too. Song Lang had also experienced this.</p>
 <p>They went directly to the cooking window with the fewest people. The school’s dishes were all very economical. You can enjoy boiled pork slices, fried pork in scoop, cutlass fish in tomato sauce, fried lotus root stuffed with pork, stir-fried broccoli as well as sweet and sour pork ribs in a big iron basin for less than 100 yuan.</p>
 <p>After finding a table, Chen Shi picked up his chopsticks and went straight for the sweet and sour ribs. He put a bite into his mouth and said in ecstasy "Mm, it still tastes the same."</p>
 <p>"By the way, Senior, in which year did you actually graduate?" Lin Dongxue asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"I can't remember. The Xinhai Revolution<span id="footnote-ref-c3d4"><a href="#footnote-c3d4">[1]</a></span> just started when I first came here to eat sweet and sour pork ribs." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"Madman, why would I believe that?! How did you and Captain Peng meet then?""It was a revolutionary friendship established during the Nanchang Uprising." <span id="footnote-ref-b610"><a href="#footnote-b610">[2]</a></span>"Be serious!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, we met in a very dramatic way. During my internship, I was investigating a case of acid attacks. During the investigation, I saw this secretive kid walking over with a glass bottle. I asked him what the bottle was filled with and he didn't answer. He turned his head and left. I pinned him to the ground instantly and the smell was pungent. I was so excited. I thought I had caught the true culprit. I took him to the bureau for an interrogation. This kid was disadvantaged personality-wise. He spoke slowly, his gaze was evasive, and he couldn’t help but looked like a suspect. He said that he was studying medical drugs and that he had gone out to buy drugs for experiments. The interrogator asked him for his student ID. He said that he had lost it, but the interrogator didn't believe him. While I was listening outside, I vaguely felt that I might have made a mistake. Thus, I ran back to the place where I had arrested him and found his student ID in the trash can. This proved his identity. In order to make amends, I invited him to dinner that night. Just like that, an exchange of blows led to friendship."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Your intuition was already so keen even when you were an intern? It’s a great talent to be able to distinguish between truth and lies. When ten suspects enter the interrogation room, nine out of the ten would say that they’re innocent."</p>
 <p>"I’m flattered."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked Tao Yueyue, "Military training is about to end, right? National Day is coming up soon, do you want to go out to enjoy yourself?"</p>
 <p>"Why choose to go out when it will be the most crowded? I have never felt that travelling could be very rewarding. I might as well stay home reading books and playing video games! I will go and see 'Miso' then. She’s also in a boarding high school and only comes back during the holidays."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "In fact, I don't like traveling very much either. Speaking of the depth of knowledge acquired, it’s not as effective as reading. The few times I have gone to other places in my life were all on business."</p>
 <p>"You’re really a soul father and daughter." Lin Dongxue smiled.</p>
 <p>Incidents always happen suddenly. A boy rushed into the canteen and said in horror, "Oh no! The instructor has been murdered!"</p>
 <p>Many students laid down their chopsticks and gathered around to ask what happened. Tao Yueyue said unhurriedly, "I hope it’s our instructor... Ah, it wouldn’t really be our instructor, right?"</p>
 <p>"Go! Let’s go and see!" Chen Shi stood up.</p>
