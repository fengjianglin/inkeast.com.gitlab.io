 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At 10:00 in the evening, in the corridor of a small hotel, Zhang Kui was leaning in front of a door with a cigarette as screams came from inside the door. "Help, rape!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A person passing by glanced sideways and Zhang Kui said with hostility, "What are you looking at? Do you want to die?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The man picked up the pace and walked away. Zhang Kui shouted from behind, "I’ve remembered what you look like. If you dare call the police, I’ll invalidate you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The man turned around as he descended the stairs and waved his hands. "I won’t dare! I won’t dare!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Kui exhaled the smoke with pride. He knocked on the door. "Dad, be more quiet. People outside can hear you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Don't bother me!" A voice inside roared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong was pulling the girl’s clothes apart. He was sweating impatiently. The new type of bra was too difficult to undo. The girl was still struggling. He said impatiently, "Don’t scream. If this kind of thing gets out, would you still have face?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The girl was so frightened that she turned pale. Zhang Farong finally undid her bra. Seeing the girl's upper body made him excited. He began to play with his crime-making tools. However, the old man was so old that he couldn’t enter the correct state.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He regretted that he didn’t buy a small blue pill before he came and wasted his son’s filial deed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At this time, there was a bang outside, which made Zhang Farong shake a little. Then, three big men pushed the door in. The two walking behind carried Zhang Kui whose face was swollen and he was beaten unconscious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The big man in the front widened his eyes. "You dare rape my wife in broad daylight when things are peaceful?<span id="footnote-ref-7d5f"><a href="#footnote-7d5f">[1]</a></span> You old fart, why aren’t you getting off the bed?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong looked at the girl in bed who put the blanket over her chest as she cried softly, and then at the group of people who came in. He understood immediately. It was no wonder that it was so easy to trick her into coming to the hotel. It was definitely a trap.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Without clothes, even his aura felt weaker. Zhang Farong said, "Misunderstanding. It’s a misunderstanding, brother. She didn't say anything!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"How do you think we should take care of this matter? Public or private?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He glanced at his son. Zhang Farong clenched his jaw. "Don’t play this game with me. Us father and son both walk the path of the underworld. Don’t threaten us with the police. I don’t have a job and my son doesn’t either. You can report us. We’ll be released after two days max. Hmph, I know you guys wouldn’t dare call the police.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hoho!" The big man smiled. "You seem to understand, so I won’t talk in circles. If I break your legs here, would you call the police?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong felt humiliated and took off the only piece of fabric on his body – the undershirt on his upper body. He revealed the dragon tattoo on his chest that looked a bit odd due to the slack in skin from old age.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He smacked his chest. "Fuck, you didn’t investigate who Zhang Farong at the South Gate Vegetable Market was like back then? You dare blackmail me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Okay, so you want to do this the hard way!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The big man made a gesture. One minute later, the father and son knelt on the ground with swollen faces and the big man kept hitting Zhang Farong's face. "Old fart, do you still want to fight with me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I don't dare." Zhang Farong whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Give me money or I’ll break one of your legs. You choose!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The father and son looked at each other with swollen eyes and started to take out their money. Zhang Farong handed over a bank card and said, "The password is xxx. There’s 200,000 in it. I know the market. It should be enough."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Who knew that the group of people had brought an Eftpos machine with them? They swiped the card on the spot and the big man slapped him in the face. "XXX. There’s only three thousand in there."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong pleaded with his hands together. "I only have this much. I don’t have anything else."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Is there anything valuable on his body?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After searching them for a long time, his son "contributed" a large, gold chain. The big man's eyes lit up as he bit it with his teeth. He found that the gold paint on the top broke off, exposing the iron chain below. He raged and used the "gold chain" to whack Zhang Kui across the face, causing a bloody line. "You like fucking pretending, huh? Pretend away!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Kui defended with his hand as he cried for mercy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The big man said, "That’s right. If you weren’t so poor, you wouldn't do this kind of thing. Take out your ID card."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong thought that dead pigs weren’t afraid of boiling water. He didn't work and his reputation wasn’t good anyway, so he pulled out his ID card. However, Zhang Kui desperately shook his head and whispered, "Dad, don't!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The big man held the ID card, did something on his mobile phone, and finally smiled. "Done. You should pay back the money yourself!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What money?" Zhang Farong was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Kui said sadly, "He made a small loan with your ID card!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Small loan? You can use your phone to borrow money so easily now?" Zhang Farong still didn't understand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"How much did you borrow and from which company?" Zhang Kui asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The big man let him have a look. When he saw the figure of 200,000, he almost collapsed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After getting the money, the big man called his men to finish work. Before they left, they grabbed the underwear on the ground and chucked it on Zhang Farong's face before educating him, "Take care of your dick. Don't mess up your reputation when you’re old."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When the people left, Zhang Kui sat paralyzed on the ground, "Dad, 200,000! If we don't pay it right away, the interest will accumulate and we won’t know how much it’ll become!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong's lips trembled. He punched Zhang Kui while shouting, "You’re so useless… You can’t even do this sort of thing… Getting scammed even though you’re walking this path… I should have shot you onto the wall<span id="footnote-ref-367f"><a href="#footnote-367f">[2]</a></span>!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Kui, who was getting beaten, anxiously pushed Zhang Farong away. He angrily shouted, "You’re the one who wanted a woman but wasn’t willing to spend money! You’re happy now, aren’t you?! That money was borrowed with your ID card. I don't care!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Kui stood up and Zhang Farong asked, "Where are you going?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Leave me alone!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Zhang Farong left the small hotel, it happened to be raining lightly, reflecting his depressive mood. A sound of Peking Opera could be heard in the distance and he suddenly felt like he had lost just like Guan Yu in Lu Meng’s invasion of Jing Province<span id="footnote-ref-b169"><a href="#footnote-b169">[3]</a></span>. The hero was old now and it was depressing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Zhang Farong shook his head. Whether it was rain or tears that dripped down from his eyes were unknown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As he walked, he went to his nephew's shop. After all, this was the place where he was born and raised. The memory of going home was engraved in his bones and couldn’t be erased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Seeing this familiar two-story building, evil fire welled in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone’s bullying me now that I’m old. The world is getting worse and people’s attitudes are different from those of the past</span><span>!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">So, he bought something with the last bit of pocket change he had. When he got back, it was dark and windy. No one was around. He took a handkerchief and wrapped it around a brick. He shattered the shop window and then cleaned up the surrounding glass debris. He opened the window and crawled awkwardly inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The second floor was where the nephew's family lived. At this time, the family was sleeping soundly. Zhang Farong wandered around the store using the shimmering moonlight outside. He opened the freezer. There were several metal basins inside which were filled with meat filling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He sprinkled some powder into the meat filling and wiped it, making it invisible to the eye. He held a cheerful smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">See how you can continue running this damn shop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Before he left, he remembered to clean up the scene. He would go home and use tools to repair the broken window. The debris on the ground had to be picked up so that others wouldn’t notice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He squatted down, and because of the dim light, the process of picking up the debris was very difficult. His hand was cut in the middle of it and he quickly sucked on his finger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">There was thunder outside, so he didn’t hear the movement of someone coming downstairs. The man who was quietly approaching behind him clearly saw the man squatting on the ground. His face contorted with anger. He picked up a kitchen knife and held it up high.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A flash of lightning cast his shadow on the wall. Zhang Farong looked up, startled.</span></p>
