 <p>Wang Haitao asked Chen Shi, "Mr. Chen, will you stay?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "Mr. Wang, I want to talk to them in private."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao understood, stood up and said, "You guys talk. I'll get something to drink."</p>
 <p>Since everyone there was on the same side, Chen Shi could be more relaxed. He asked kk and Sun Zhen, "You two really plan to run this agency?"</p>
 <p>kk pretended to speak in a profound manner, "Let's experience a little more while we're young! We’re getting old and bald. They’re precious experiences in life."</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen glared at him and said, "I think I can make good use of my strengths but I need to see how much I can earn!"</p>
 <p>"How much money can you make by typing code on your computer every day?" kk asked.</p>
 <p>"More than you who steals chickens and touches dogs<span id="footnote-ref-b2fa"><a href="#footnote-b2fa">[1]</a></span>." Sun Zhen retorted.</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay!" Chen Shi said, "In fact, I have a plan to use this agency to serve as our temporary base, and the equipment required by the agency can also be used to find Zhou Xiao. You two will stay here, but you have to run the business well. The shares are yours. If you can’t make any profits, you’ll have to put your own money into the business.”</p>
 <p>kk handed Chen Shi a glass of juice. "Brother Chen, you’re not joining us?"</p>
 <p>"I can't be both a police consultant and run a private detective agency at the same time. But if there are any troublesome cases, I can help out."</p>
 <p>"What do you mean by ‘help out’! Brother Chen, you’re so modest." kk put his arm around Chen Shi's shoulder. "You’re our boss! Our backbone!"</p>
 <p>"Little thief, you’re so good at brown-nosing." Chen Shi smiled, raised his glass and clinked his in a toast, then looked at Gu You, "Miss Gu, what about you?"</p>
 <p>"I have my own business, but just like Brother Chen, when you need my help, I’ll come... We can’t be lazy looking for Zhou Xiao. For every day that we let him run free outside, we’ll have an extra day of danger.”</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen asked, "Miss Gu, what kind of bad blood do you have with Zhou Xiao?"</p>
 <p>Gu You hesitated. "We’ll talk about it next time!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi proposed, "At the end of this month, we should hold a group bonding activity. We can get together as well as discuss our work!"</p>
 <p>kk applauded, "Sounds good. Come, let's have a drink as the four comrades of revolution."</p>
 <p>The four clinked their glasses together, and Chen Shi beckoned to Wang Haitao. Wang Haitao sat down and asked, "Have you guys finished discussing?"</p>
 <p>"That's right, Mr. Wang, I’ll accept the 80% of the company’s shares even though it’s thick-skinned of me to do so. I’ll let these two brothers of mine run the business!” Chen Shi explained.</p>
 <p>kk said with a smile, "Boss Lu, please take care of us!"</p>
 <p>"Since you have all decided, so be it. I'll come over and sign a contract with you guys tomorrow."</p>
 <p>After the matter was settled, kk and Sun Zhen were very happy and cheered themselves on. Chen Shi thought of something and asked Sun Zhen, "Little Worm, you said you found a mole in the group. Who was it?"</p>
 <p>"It's Little Han’s mother. I found out that she and Teacher Gao had close contact with each other. In fact, they have been in contact since March this year. I went to her daughter's school to check. Guess what-"</p>
 <p>"Stop keeping me in suspense!"</p>
 <p>"Her daughter cheated in this year's art school entrance exam and has been disqualified from this year's university entrance examinations."</p>
 <p>"Disqualified from the university entrance exams?" Chen Shi thought for a while. "She still pretended to buy university entrance examination papers. So she’s actually a shill! I’ll handle this loose end tomorrow."</p>
 <p>The next day, the entrance examinations officially started. Chen Shi received a text message from Sister Chen who thanked him effusively. Through this incident, Sister Chen had also realized that cheating was not a good idea. No matter how many points her son got that year or even if he had to repeat the exam, she will accept reality and never take shortcuts again.</p>
 <p>That morning, Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue went to Little Han's mother's residence. The house was in chaos. The couple was arguing, "It's all because you only have money in your eyes. And you even said it was foolproof. Now that the scammers have been arrested, I’m sure you won’t get off easily!” “Who did I do this for, if not for this family? It was all in order to earn more tuition for Little Han. Do you think it’s easy for me? How are you any better? You just stand back and talk without any backaches<span id="footnote-ref-52b6"><a href="#footnote-52b6">[2]</a></span>.” “Haii, don’t bring so many clothes! Let’s hurry up and go!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pushed the door and went in. Little Han's mother, who was packing her luggage, and Little Han's father, who was standing at the side, were dumbfounded. Lin Dongxue showed her badge to them. "Little Han’s mother, you’ll need to come with us!"</p>
 <p>Little Han's mother widened her eyes and said, "Officers, please listen to my explanation. I didn't mean to lie to anyone. The scammers told me that if I helped out, they’ll give me some money. It was like I was possessed! But I haven’t earned a dime up to now!”</p>
 <p>It seemed that the woman's mental fortitude wasn’t that great. She had confessed everything in the face of the police. Lin Dongxue said, "You can explain when you come back with us to the station!"</p>
 <p>Little Han's mother opened her mouth wide and wailed, sitting down on the floor.</p>
 <p>After witnessing a parting show filled with dog blood<span id="footnote-ref-62a0"><a href="#footnote-62a0">[3]</a></span>, the two finally put Little Han’s mother in handcuffs and put her in the car. She wept all the way and recounted how she had been wronged and also said. "You can’t blame me for this. If those parents weren’t foolish and ill-intentioned and believed that they could get the papers, they wouldn’t have been scammed!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "People who are fooled do have their own reasons. People have all kinds of greed. This is normal. It is awful to use this greed to scam them... Little Han’s mother, you don’t need to cry. You need to accept the responsibility for your own actions. The police won't sympathize with your tears."</p>
 <p>Little Han's mother lowered her head. "Will Little Han’s entrance exams next year be affected by this?”</p>
 <p>The fraud involved a huge amount of money. When Little Han takes the entrance examination next year, she will still be in prison as an offender. It was impossible to say that she will not be affected, but Chen Shi still lied to her and said, "This is your business. It won’t affect her. Since things are already like this, you should at least set a good example for your child and be accountable for your own actions!"</p>
 <p>Little Han's mother pursed her lips and slowly buried her face in her hands. She held her face and cried silently.</p>
 <p>When she was transferred to the police station in the district, Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue's mission was over. The local police said that the money had been recovered and would be returned to those parents. An anti-scam lecture was organized for them as well.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "A daunting experience without any mishap. Let’s go and eat!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled and asked, "What do you want to eat?"</p>
 <p>"Up to you."</p>
 <p>"Then let’s go and eat your favorite grilled fish."</p>
 <p>That day, there shouldn’t be anyone sent by Wang Haitao to quietly settle the bill. Finally, they can eat comfortably for once. However, the two were blocked on the road. There was a special coach for the entrance examination passing by. All the drivers knew the importance of the exam and naturally allowed them to pass first.</p>
 <p>Looking at the children chatting and laughing on the coach, Lin Dongxue said, "In the year that I took the entrance examination, I felt that all my suffering was finally over. After the exam, I thought I would have a golden life ahead of me. However, when I went over, it turned out that it was all just brass. It turns out that life was the easiest when I was still a student."</p>
 <p>"If you were given a chance to go back to be a student, would you?"</p>
 <p>"I’d be willing, but if I wouldn’t have met you because of it, I don't think so!" Lin Dongxue laughed.</p>
