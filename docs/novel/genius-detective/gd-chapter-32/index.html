 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Early the next morning, Lin Qiupu came to the unit and went to the forensics department to take a test report. Peng Sijue stayed here all night again, and the coffee machine was brewing a fragrant Blue Mountain coffee. Peng Sijue stared at the computer screen and said without turning around, “The report is on the table.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Although Lin Qiupu usually drank LongJing, for the past two days he had become too tired from trying to solve the case. When he smelled the coffee, he couldn’t help but pour himself a cup. Peng Sijue is such a person. He is never polite to others and does not need others to be polite with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The hard and bitter coffee sank down into his stomach and Lin Qiupu’s mind felt refreshed. “Thank you, Old&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Peng. If you didn’t think of testing the blood lipids, we wouldn’t have thought that the murderer was actually him! Oh yeah, how did you think of this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“It wasn’t me who thought of it, Chen Shi told me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Chen Shi? Which Chen Shi?” Lin Qiupu was so shocked, the coffee cup in his hand almost slipped and broke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Who else is called Chen Shi? It’s the driver you don’t like!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Him?!” Lin Qiupu was shocked and put down the cup, his heart restless.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Who the hell is this guy? How did he grab the lead ahead of the task force once again? After getting this clue yesterday, I was so proud and happy, I thought this time I would beat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Peng Sijue questioned indifferently, “Should I not have told you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu laughed dryly. “I asked him to help solve the case. Why would I not want you to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“You didn't gamble on anything this time, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“That's good. This saves you from being embarrassed in front of your sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If it was from anyone else, Lin Qiupu may have exploded in anger immediately, but Peng Sijue was not just anyone else. Lin Qiupu finished his coffee and picked up the report. “I’ll be leaving first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There is no such thing as a goodbye to Peng Sijue. He continued to look at the computer with focus on the household registration. The name was Chen Shi. The last column of this information was filled with “missing since 2016”. Peng Sijue muttered, “Who exactly are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu went to the conference room, and there was less than ten hours left before the time he had set the case to be resolved by. Today's case analysis meeting wouldn’t go on for long, as there wasn’t much to discuss. The case was already very clear and all forces would be mobilized to search for the Kong Wende.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In the conference room, everyone was passing around a newspaper. Lin Qiupu stood behind several female police officers. The officers didn’t notice him at first. After being discovered, those officers were stunned and immediately stood up straight. “Captain Lin, you’re here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“What are you looking at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Um, today's Long’An Morning Post. I don't know which reporter wrote the article, but it was quite detailed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“What? Let me see!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu took the newspaper and skimmed through it. The newspaper wrote about the case in detail and added oil to fire, “When the victim's child woke up and saw the whole family killed, he jumped helplessly from the third floor and suffered a severe brain injury. He is now lying in the Third People’s Hospital, in coma. This poor child does not know that he has become an orphan. I hope that the city’s good-hearted people can lend a helping hand and donate. The donation hotline...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Qiupu was so angry that he almost tore the newspaper. He interrogated the people in the room, “Who spread the news?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Everyone looked blank, whereas Lin Dongxue had a flustered face because she knew that this was done yesterday by Chen Shi who told a reporter. She was also present when that happened, during which she also persuaded Chen Shi that her brother would go crazy when he found out. Chen Shi smiled calmly. “Don’t worry. Firstly, I am not a team member; Secondly, the Captain Lin did not ask me to keep it confidential beforehand. Moreover, even if something went wrong, it would all be on me. What are you afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This newspaper was a bait set by Chen Shi. Although Chen Shi wore a confident look, Lin Dongxue did not agree. Would Kong Wende really see the report and risk his way to the hospital to visit his child?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The mission that day was still to continue the search for Kong Wende. After all the explanations were completed, Lin Qiupu asked everyone to disperse first, then stopped two policemen before they left. “Old Zhang, Xiao Zhang, you both go to the hospital to monitor the boy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Dongxue was shocked. Her reaction was seen by Lin Qiupu. Lin Qiupu walked over to her. “Even if you want to make meritorious deeds, you still shouldn’t do this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Dongxue blushed. “It was Chen Shi’s idea!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I guessed as much!” Lin Qiupu grit his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Dongxue stood up straight, “Captain Lin, I request permission to go to the hospital as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After watching Lin Dongxue for a few seconds, Lin Qiupu said, “Go! Don't be proud of yourself. I won’t be expecting much because I’m pretty sure that his idea is useless! We have already searched for Kong Wende in the city. Since there’s so much police movement around the area, he should be hiding out. How can he risk exposing himself to go visit his son? Furthermore, look at the newspaper you picked, the sales volume is only tens of thousands of copies. You think Kong Wende will see this? Thinking you’re so smart!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After saying his piece, Lin Qiupu left. Lin Dongxue breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She and the other two policemen went to the hospital. According to the previous agreement, Chen Shi had already arrived here early. The child had recovered. It’s just that he’s a bit zoned out due to the trauma. Chen Shi was carefully peeling an apple in his room, trying to start a conversation with him every now and then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“You! Come out!” Lin Dongxue commanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Putting the chopped apple on the plate, Chen Shi went out and still smiled. “What's wrong? Why are you so mad?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Look at your stupid ideas. My brother found out about it. He also mentioned that the newspaper sold only tens of thousands of copies, and Kong Wende may not see it at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Yes, the sales volume is not high, but that does not mean that the reading volume is not good. Do you know why I chose this newspaper? Because it is cheap, many breakfast shops order them. After the guests have finished reading it, they take it to wrap their breakfast. Kong Wende also needs to eat. He is very likely to see it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“If he doesn’t see it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Everything has a risk. I can only say that there is a great probability Kong Wende will come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I hope it will be as you’ve said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Surveillance work was very boring. The little boy wouldn’t talk to anyone. He would only say a few words to Lin Dongxue, but whenever his family was mentioned, he would cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When she thought that the little boy had lost both parents at once, Lin Dongxue was sympathetic and shed a few tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi said, “If you look at some people from afar, they may seem annoying to you. However, when you look at them closely, you can see that their situation is very sad. He had a family and a home, but because of all sorts of reasons, he reached a dead end. The result was that his home was torn apart and his family members all died.” When he talked about this, Chen Shi looked melancholic and depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Dongxue groaned at him. “You make it sound like you’ve been exposed to a lot of criminals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I saw it in a TV series! Yes, I’ve been watching “Reading the Heart” recently!” Chen Shi restored his smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As the morning stretched into the afternoon, Lin Dongxue starting to grow anxious. As she walked around the corridor and watched people come and go, the fantasy in her heart slowly crumbled bit by bit. Kong Wende probably wouldn’t come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Although she didn't say anything, she was very keen on earning accolades and wanted to prove herself to Lin Qiupu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Seeing that everything was becoming hopeless, she became very worried and impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At this time, a harsh alarm sounded in the corridor, and the red light flashed. The nurse shouted, “There is a fire! There is a fire! Take cover!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Chen Shi ran out of the ward. “He’s coming. He’s finally coming!”</span></p>
