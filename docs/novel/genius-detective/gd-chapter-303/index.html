 <p>When he thought about having this “time-traveler” living at his place, Chen Shi sighed. He found Lin Dongxue and told her that he wanted to see the information about the robbery.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked curiously, “Weren’t you planning to not participate in this case?”</p>
 <p>“The faster I solve this case, the faster that guy leaves my place. Who can stand living with a prince in the house?”</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, I moved away.” Lin Dongxue laughed. After the previous case was over, she moved back to her rental house. “Are you good at robbery cases?”</p>
 <p>“Not at all!”</p>
 <p>The information on hand was mainly a list of lost items, as well as a surveillance video taken from opposite the gold shop. On the afternoon of April 23rd, two masked criminals went to a gold shop on Yangquan Road riding a motorcycle with the license plate covered. In the gold shop, one person took out a gun while the other took out a hammer and started hitting the glass counters with it. The shop attendant screamed constantly in fear.</p>
 <p>The entire process lasted less than five minutes. Because the gold shop used tempered glass that could not be broken, the gangster held a gun against the shop clerk's head while they put a lot of gold ornaments into the gangster's bag before they took off.</p>
 <p>The total value of the stolen goods was estimated to be about 300,000 yuan. Of course, if the gangsters want to sell the stolen goods, the price must be discounted in half.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi watched the video twice and asked Lin Dongxue, “This gun wasn’t fired the whole time. Is it real or fake?”</p>
 <p>“We suspect it’s a fake gun. There are not many ways for people to get a real gun in Long’an City. We have investigated this, but we haven't found the origin of this gun. There is a high probability that it’s a fake gun. However, at the time, the clerk didn’t want to take any risks and just tried to protect themselves through complying with the criminals’ demands.”</p>
 <p>“I feel that these two people are quite professional. Are there similar cases?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, there was a convenience store robbery in Long’an the year before similar to the crime style this time. At that time, there were three people.”</p>
 <p>“Convenience store robbery? For the money?”</p>
 <p>“Smoke and alcohol.”</p>
 <p>“Professional!” Chen Shi sighed. Nowadays people paid through WeChat, so there wasn’t much cash in cash registers. What was really valuable were the cigarettes and alcohol on the shelves. Furthermore, these things are easy to sell. There were many places that accepted tobacco and liquor in exchange for cash.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi watched the video several times. He pointed at the gangster with the hammer and said, “This man looked at his accomplice three times during the robbery. They both covered their faces and only showed their eyes. They should just be communicating through their gazes.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“It shows that their relationship is very good and this person is psychologically dependent on the other person. They were probably very flustered during the robbery, so they subconsciously sought encouragement from their companion's eyes... I feel that they are either brothers or a couple. “</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue stared at the screen. “This person wrapped themselves in clothes very tightly and isn’t tall...” She fast-forwarded the video and came to the clip where the two left on motorcycles. “When running, one held their partner's waist. They seem to be very intimate, so I feel like the probability of them being a couple is higher.”</p>
 <p>They simply coded the woman as B and the man as A. Chen Shi asked Lin Dongxue to find the surveillance video of the convenience store robbery from the year before.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, in the video, B also kept looking at the eyes of A. Another person (codenamed X) kept standing at the door and gestured to them, acting like the superior of the two. It was clear that X was the big brother in this small group.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked, “Who is the time-traveler among these three then?”</p>
 <p>“We’ll know when we compare them.”</p>
 <p>“How do we do that?”</p>
 <p>“Follow me!”</p>
 <p>Nalan Fang was still in the interrogation room. Lin Qiupu bought him a boxed lunch. He walked around the room after eating it. Chen Shi video taped him using his phone and compared it with the two surveillance videos.</p>
 <p>Nalan Fang's movements were different from the three criminals.</p>
 <p>In addition, the height and shape of the bodies were obviously not comparable either.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the time-traveler is not a member of the gang. You can safely let him live in your house.” Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>“How did the time-traveler associate himself with the robbery gang?” Chen Shi muttered. “Try to figure it out using the life he made for himself. He has a father, two brothers, and another bad guy who prevents him from seeing them. Father and brother... Kidnapping?”</p>
 <p>“I think you’re thinking too much. Maybe an ingot fell from the robber's bag and was picked up by him.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t I meet with such good fortune?” Chen Shi smiled.</p>
 <p>“From now on, try walking with your head down to try.” Lin Dongxue also smiled.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go and see what Old Peng has found.” Chen Shi suggested.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue went to the physical evidence center with the clothes and shoes of the time-traveler as the samples there were relatively complete. A soil expert analyzed the material on the soles of the shoes and determined that the time-traveler might have stayed near the southern suburbs for a while.</p>
 <p>As for the clothes, it was made up of 70% of chemical fiber and 30% of cotton. Obviously, it did not “cross over” with him as he had said. There were no chemical fibers in ancient times.</p>
 <p>The experts sought answers on some cosplay forums. Some netizens said that this fabric was used for photo studios and cosplay clothing. Because the market was not large, Long’an City produced these clothes in small workshops and there were no formal enterprises that sold them.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, “It seems that we can only find the stores one by one.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, “It seems like there’s not much for me to do today. I will take the prince home first.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi brought Nalan Fang home and met Tao Yueyue. Nalan Fang asked Chen Shi, “Your daughter?”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m her guardian.”</p>
 <p>“Hello!” Nalan Fang greeted Tao Yueyue.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought to himself that this guy also understood modern Chinese. Since he was a person from modern times, if he found out his identity, the robbery will probably be solved.</p>
 <p>Nalan Fang looked all around the room. Afraid of him not behaving himself, Chen Shi brought over a copy of Dream of Red Mansions and pointed to the computer. “Do you want to read this, or look at that?”</p>
 <p>Nalan Fang pointed to the computer. “What is this?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi turned on the computer and broadcasted an ancient drama to him. Nalan Fang nodded in appreciation. “Quite colorful and entertaining. It’s to my tastes.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue dragged Chen Shi to the bedroom and whispered, “This weirdo is going to live in our house?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, “There’s no way around it. Just compromise for a few days.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not at ease with a stranger in the house. May I go to Sister Lin's side?”</p>
 <p>“If you can't stand it, I'll contact Dongxue.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue thought about it and said, “Forget it. I'll close the bedroom door. Tell him not to come in... And don't touch my cat.”</p>
 <p>“See how honest he is...” Chen Shi looked back. Nalan Fang was actually trying to get the wine on the shelf. Chen Shi rushed to the living room and said, “Hey, prince, be careful not to break them!”</p>
 <p>Other than that, Nalan Fang was fairly well-behaved in general. However, he was just sitting in the room, making the whole atmosphere in the house strange.</p>
 <p>In the evening, Chen Shi heard the sound of the door opening next door. Knowing that Gu You was back, he went to pay the money back. Gu You asked, “Where is that time-traveler?”</p>
 <p>“In my house.” Chen Shi forced a smile.</p>
