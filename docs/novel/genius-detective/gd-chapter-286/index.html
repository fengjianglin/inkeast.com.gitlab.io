 <p>The police immediately blocked the surrounding intersections. Lin Qiupu took a photo of Wang Sunxu and personally led people around to check the street shops.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was still paired with Lin Dongxue, and they asked several stores. A convenience store employee said that the young man had come to the store to buy things not long ago.</p>
 <p>“Do you have any surveillance footage?” Lin Dongxue asked excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Don't bother looking at surveillance footage. When was this? What did he buy?” Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>“About four-thirty. He bought a bunch of Sprites, and some sandwiches.” The clerk said.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi picked up a bottle of Sprite and looked at it, saying, “Asshole, he intends to continue killing people.”</p>
 <p>“Using Sprite this time?”</p>
 <p>“No, you see how this bottle is very similar to that carbonated drink? He must have pre-packaged the beverage packaging and bottle caps in advance. Those things are easier to carry.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was surprised, “So even if the whole city doesn’t sell that drink, he still has his crime tools? If we watched all the convenience stores, wouldn’t he be unable to commit crimes any more? It’s not like he could sell the drinks on the street, right?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi mumbled to himself, saying that she was right. Wang Sunxu's method of committing the crime was very difficult. Why did he do it? Was there another mystery in it?</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue informed everyone by radio, and Chen Shi continued to search on the street. The security guard of a housing district said that he saw the teenager coming in recently and that he was wearing a black sweater. As he was not a resident of the housing community, the security guard had stopped and questioned him. He claimed to be a relative of one of the residents.</p>
 <p>There were many buildings in the housing district. Just as the two of them went around to investigate, a flower pot fell from upstairs, frightening bystanders, who screamed. Chen Shi looked up and said, “Go upstairs!”</p>
 <p>The two found the apartment that threw the pot down. Chen Shi knocked on the door but didn’t get any response. He rammed the door with his shoulder three times before it opened. There was something wrong inside. They saw a mother and daughter tied up on the floor and their mouths were stuffed with socks.</p>
 <p>The father, who was tied up like a worm, was lying on the floor of the balcony. He had just toppled the pot down with his head in order to call for help.</p>
 <p>There was some leftover food on the table and a bowl of instant noodles was still steaming. Chen Shi immediately rushed out the door. He intuitively determined that Wang Sunxu went upstairs. Most of the buildings were connected through the rooftops, so he could move between buildings that way.</p>
 <p>He ran to the top floor and found that the lock on the rooftop had been pried open. He pushed open the door to the rooftop. It was evening, and the sunset was like a fire in the distance. The rooftop was empty.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked around and suddenly found a rope tied to the railing. He rushed over and saw a young man in black with a fanny pack. He was slowly descending to the road from the exterior wall of the building. It was Wang Sunxu.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Wang Sunxu had descended to around the height of the fifth floor. While their eyes met, he smiled calmly, placed two fingers on his forehead and then flicked them forward, in a respectful salute.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi gritted his teeth and prepared to slide down the rope, but when he pulled it hard, the metal railing became loose. The railing couldn’t bear the weight of the two people.</p>
 <p>He also had the option of untying the rope and letting Wang Sunxu die.</p>
 <p>Wang Sunxu shouted, “Officer Song, that would be a real murder. Do you want to change your face again?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi called Lin Dongxue and said, “Dongxue, go to the north wall immediately.”</p>
 <p>“I'm untying the family...”</p>
 <p>“Wang Sunxu is moving downstairs with a rope. Hurry up!”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll head there now!”</p>
 <p>Wang Sunxu was clearly aware of the danger and accelerated the speed of his descent. When he reached the second floor, his eyes narrowed and Chen Shi suddenly pulled the rope off. Wang Sunxu fell heavily onto the ground, arching his back in pain and rolled around. Many passers-by gathered to watch.</p>
 <p>“He's a bad guy. Catch him and you’ll get a reward!” Chen Shi shouted, but none of the people in the crowd dared to step forward.</p>
 <p><em>Damn bystander effect!</em></p>
 <p>Chen Shi cursed silently as he rushed down as fast as he could. When he ran out of the housing district, he heard a few gunshots, and saw a black SUV continuously overtaking other cars on the road. He ran over to Lin Dongxue and the gun in her hand was smoking. He asked her what had happened.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said angrily, “I almost caught him. A car suddenly took him away!”</p>
 <p>“Calm down, it's not your fault.” Chen Shi felt disappointed but comforted her.</p>
 <p>“It's all my fault!” Lin Dongxue looked unwilling to accept the situation.</p>
 <p>In the SUV that escaped, the driver said, “You are not professional enough to play with serial killings. I will only help you this one time. You’re on your own next time.”</p>
 <p>Wang Sunxu rubbed his painful spine and said, “I didn't expect him to dare to untie the rope.”</p>
 <p>“A man who has lost everything is more desperate than you think.”</p>
 <p>Wang Sunxu touched his backpack. “Thank you. The next part is the climax. You just wait and see!”</p>
 <p>Later, Lin Qiupu and the others who came to the scene heard about the situation and they all felt that it was a great pity. Lin Qiupu said, “It seems that the real murderer can be confirmed to be Wang Sunxu, and he has associates as well... Dongxue, where did you fire your shots?”</p>
 <p>“Towards the sky. I should have fired at him... Captain Lin, I’m not trying to shirk responsibility, but there were too many passers-by at the time, so I didn’t dare to shoot!” Lin Dongxue said angrily.</p>
 <p>“You were right in your decision-making. You can't shoot in that situation. We are police. We must abide by the principles even while catching the bad guys!” Lin Qiupu said to the others, “Our direction of investigation is correct. This time we forced Wang Sunxu into a corner, but he will be arrested next time!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was silent the whole time. The “Officer Song” that Wang Sunxu said, was still lingering in his ears. The day when Wang Sunxu is arrested will probably be the moment when his true identity would be exposed.</p>
 <p>Just now, he did have the impulse to kill Wang Sunxu, but he couldn't do it. Even if he was Chen Shi now, the police bottom line was still deeply embedded in his heart.</p>
 <p>He had thought that the time would eventually come. He had escaped for three years, but it was time to face everything.</p>
 <p>“Old Chen, why aren’t you speaking?” Lin Qiupu asked.</p>
 <p>“I'm wondering why he didn't kill the family when they saw his face? It seems that he’s following the rules of the game he has set, and he won’t kill the people who didn't buy those bottle caps.” Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>“Do you think it's a game? Okay, then we'll be there to play with him to the end.”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu's cell phone rang. After answering, his expression changed greatly, saying, “Wang Sunxu has committed another crime!”</p>
 <p>“So fast?” The policemen were shocked.</p>
 <p>It seems that they were going to need to work overtime that night. Chen Shi called Tao Yueyue and said that he couldn't come back that night and told her to be careful on her way back from school. Tao Yueyue said, “Relax, I'm home already.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, there are bad people outside. You need to lock the door at night. Don't go out, okay? I'll call you when I get home.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I understand!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue hung up the phone, and Gu You, who was sitting opposite her, said with a smile, “Uncle Chen seems to be very busy.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, he often works overtime.”</p>
 <p>“Do you understand the things I just talked about?”</p>
 <p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
 <p>“I want to play a fun game with you...” Gu You took out a small paper bag, and the smile on her face was still bright and enchanting. “Put these powders into Uncle Chen's water. This is the first mission I’m giving you. As long as he successfully drinks it, I’ll reward you!”</p>
