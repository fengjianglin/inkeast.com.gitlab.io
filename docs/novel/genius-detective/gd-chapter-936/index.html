 <p>"Should we call for back-up?" Lin Dongxue took out her phone and asked.</p>
 <p>"How long would it take them to get here with the traffic conditions tonight? Please contact the nearby police station!"</p>
 <p>Just after dialing, there were footsteps behind them. The two looked back and saw Liao Chunhuang walking in with disheveled hair. His eyes widened and said, "You... despicable people. You got that old Taoist priest to distract me, and it turned out to be for this!"</p>
 <p>"Don't move!" Lin Dongxue raised her gun.</p>
 <p>After being exposed by the police, Liao Chunhuang's face was distorted with anger. He suddenly yelled and stretched out a hand towards Lin Dongxue. "Go and die!"</p>
 <p>"Don't engage in this farce!" Chen Shi said, "You don't have the self-consciousness of a swindler at all. Do you really think you have magic powers? How many people have you harmed?!"</p>
 <p>"I'm harming people!?" Liao Chunhuang walked to the concrete platform where the ceremony was going to be held. Lin Dongxue's pistol kept following him. "You were the ones who harmed me first! Back then, my wife and I fell in love with each other, but her brother desperately tried to separate us. Because I was poor at the time, he looked down on me! In order to keep her away from me, he locked her up and made her mentally ill. In the end, she was forced to kill the man and escape in order to elope with me, but you police only looked at the result. You only saw that she had killed someone, but didn’t think about who had driven her to such a step! She was such a kind, gentle and virtuous person. She was everything to me. But you wanted to shut her up together with those criminals and harm us husband and wife by not letting us see each other. I can only help her in my own way! I will be successful. I will definitely be successful!"</p>
 <p>Liao Chunhuang spoke while pulling out a knife from his sleeve. Lin Dongxue said, "Put the knife down!"</p>
 <p>Liao Chunhuang was holding the knife with his nostrils flaring. Chen Shi walked over slowly and said, "To get your wife out of jail, those five deserved to die?"</p>
 <p>"Isn't this the way of this world? The lives of the poor are like grass. Do you really care about them? Isn't it all work for you? The dead will get buried and the murderers will be caught! If I can't see her in the Yang world,<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-936#footnote-3d13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> I will go to the Yin world<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-936#footnote-5d86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a> and wait for her. No one can stop me!"</p>
 <p>As he said this, he aimed the knife at his own chest. Chen Shi quickly ran over and grabbed his arm.</p>
 <p>The two struggled with each other. Liao Chunhuang, who had lost his rationality, had great strength and desperately tried to commit suicide. Chen Shi pushed him away forcefully. Liao Chunhuang stumbled, fell on the floor, and also dropped the knife. He got up and rushed towards the entrance of the secret room.</p>
 <p>"Stop right there!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi grabbed him, pinned him to the floor, and handcuffed him from behind. Liao Chunhuang struggled non-stop, and roared, "What right do you have to meddle with me? You ordinary people don’t know anything. You don’t understand anything!"</p>
 <p>"Lamentable fellow, your wife at least resisted her brother and went to jail, but you killed people for the sake of superstition!"</p>
 <p>"The ‘Five Elements Reincarnation’ is not superstition. It’s real. Let me do it, and I will show it to you!"</p>
 <p>"Stop it!"</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Liao Chunhuang stopped struggling. He lay on the ground and said, "The police have caught me. Act now!"</p>
 <p>It didn't sound as though he was talking to Chen Shi. Chen Shi searched his clothes. It turned out that he had hidden a mobile phone in his bosom. Chen Shi was so angry that he wanted to beat him and he asked, "What order did you give?!"</p>
 <p>Liao Chunhuang laughed loudly, "You will release me in a while and accept all my conditions."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi suddenly understood. "Old Man Lu!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi uncuffed Liao Chunhuang’s hands, dragged him to the wall and handcuffed him to a pipe. His two disciples were also handled the same way.</p>
 <p>After dealing with them, the two hurried to the room where the magical performance had taken place. The room was in chaos at the moment. Old Man Lu's "new son" was strangling him from behind, and holding a knife in his hand. He was in the middle of confronting &nbsp;the old Taoist priest, Sun Zhen, kk and Wang Haitao.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Those disciples were also scared, because they hadn’t known about this secret beforehand. During the interrogations afterwards, it turned out that they didn't know about Liao Chunhuang hiring a killer to murder and collect organs.</p>
 <p>The “new son" sneered. "You came here at the right time. Let’s make an exchange. Let the Master go!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked coldly, "Is there a purpose in your desperate struggle? Originally you were just an accomplice, but now you’re taking a hostage? Do you know how serious the crime is? I’ll give you three seconds to release the man. One... two..."</p>
 <p>"Don't try this on me!" The “new son" shouted. "It’s not as though I've never been in prison before. Who do you think you’re trying to scare? If you let him go, I will let this guy go. Otherwise, this old man won’t live!"</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu trembled in fear. "Don't be impulsive. Why don’t you take my son as a hostage instead? He is young and more suitable than me, a broken old man."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao also said, "Brother, let me be the hostage. Father has heart problems and can't withstand the stress."</p>
 <p>The "new son" ignored him, and then Old Man Lu asked the old Taoist priest for help. "Old immortal, quickly use your magical powers to teach this ungrateful animal a lesson."</p>
 <p>The old Taoist priest pinched his fingers together in calculation. "Ahhhhhhh!"</p>
 <p>"What's the matter?" Old Man Lu’s heart thumped.</p>
 <p>"This is the eighty-first calamity you are destined to go through. Although I have the ability, I can't interfere. If you can survive this calamity, you will become an immortal after death."</p>
 <p>This nonsense really didn't match the current atmosphere, but Old Man Lu believed it to be true. "Can you also calculate whether I will survive?"</p>
 <p>The “new son" knocked Old Man Lu’s head with the back of the knife. "Old ‘One Foot in the Coffin’, who are you calling an animal? Before this, you called me ‘Son’ so affectionately! Let me tell you, these people, this old man, all of these motherfuckers are swindlers. You’ve been tricked, you idiot!"</p>
 <p>"Master Chunhuang is a swindler, but I’m not. I’m really an immortal." The old Taoist priest insisted.</p>
 <p>"Tch, we’re all from the same industry. Who are you bluffing?!"</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao exclaimed, "Let him go! I will plead with Officer Chen to reduce your sentence by a few years. Don't be foolish. You can't get out of here at all."</p>
 <p>The “new son" roared, "Can't you understand human words? If you let the Master go, I will let him go!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, I'll let him go now." Chen Shi made a concession in order to gain advantages.</p>
 <p>"You also have to prepare a car for us."</p>
 <p>"How far can you drive the car with the traffic jam outside?"</p>
 <p>"Then I want a helicopter. Park it on the top of this building!"</p>
 <p>"First of all, do you know how to pilot it? Secondly, the police helicopter has the words 'Public Security' on it. Are you sure you want to pilot that to escape?"</p>
 <p>"Don't play tricks with me!"</p>
 <p>At this time, Old Man Lu suddenly cried, "Haitao, I’ve let you down. I’m really not a good father and let you suffer so much in the first half of your life. After we finally acknowledged each other, I always engaged in these peculiar things and have been a burden on you. In my heart, I realize you will be a perfect heir, and that it's time for me to let go and hand things over to you, but I'm so greedy. I always want this and that. I've always been like this my whole life, and I’ve ended up with nothing, haii!"</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao also shed tears, "No matter what, you will always be my father. I’ve always respected you very much. I feel proud to have a father like you!"</p>
 <p>"I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy..." Old Man Lu’s tears fell like rain. He kept holding his hand to his chest, and suddenly, he let out a long sigh. His unscrupulous face which was never satisfied suddenly became indifferent and detached like that of a sage. "My time has come. Haitao, goodbye forever!"</p>
 <p>Then his whole body trembled, his eyes rolled back, and he went limp in the hands of the "new son".</p>
