 <p>An hour later, the police and Peng Sijue arrived. The network police sat down and plugged their laptop into the computer. It only took ten minutes to get the result before they said, "The other party should be using a wireless network with an IP address. An Internet cafe in Jinmao Road."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi waved. "Go! Go there immediately!"</p>
 <p>Everyone rushed to Jinmao Road and unexpectedly found that this was a market area. There was indeed an Internet cafe in it, which was exactly where the other party just stayed at.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Xu Xiaodong to go up and watch the surveillance video. He looked around and found that there were no other surveillance cameras except for the one at this Internet café. Also, the area was extremely noisy due to the foot traffic in the area.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pulled out his mobile phone and tried to connect to the wifi of this Internet cafe. He said, "The wifi coverage of this Internet cafe is very wide. You can avoid CCTV monitoring and surf the Internet because you only need a password."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "That person must have gone to the Internet Café before, so they know the password. Should I go up and check it out?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi shook his head. "There is too much foot traffic, so it's very difficult to check..." He looked down at the ground, suddenly took off his shoes, smelled them, and put them back on. He also told Peng Sijue to take off his shoes.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue asked, "What are you doing? What are you doing?" But was still forced to take off his shoes. Chen Shi smelled the soles of the shoes and smiled, "Fishy smell! People who have been here have a fishy smell on their feet. Immediately summon the employees of that film company. Say something urgent came up."</p>
 <p>"Return my shoes!" Peng Sijue frowned.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "What if this person is not in the company?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi turned the shoes with his fingers and said, "It's okay. So many people will be eliminated at once that the rest will be easy to check. They only have a few hired actors... Let's go!"</p>
 <p>"Old Chen, you bastard!" Peng Sijue hopped on one foot with the other behind him amidst the people.</p>
 <p>All the employees of Zhendong Film Company received the notice and rushed to the company before long. Chen Shi bought a bag of disposable slippers from a convenience store downstairs and had all the people who entered the door change their shoes. Peng Sijue conducted some simple tests.</p>
 <p>The plan seemed fool proof, but Lin Dongxue questioned it. "What if the person changed their shoes?"</p>
 <p>This made Chen Shi stop in his tracks as he said, "Your mind is getting keener and finer. You’re right, this person wouldn’t be caught like this… Where’s Xiaodong?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue looked left and right. "Did you leave him at the Internet cafe in the market?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi helplessly sighed. Only Xu Xiaodong had seen the people of the company besides him. He said, "I will go downstairs and watch the front door myself. Every time someone comes in, I’ll let you know.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi ran to a restaurant downstairs and sat down. His eyes didn’t leave the company’s main entrance for even a moment. The employees arrived one after another and Peng Sijue reported one by one, saying that their soles were all right.</p>
 <p>Quite a while later, Zhuo Xuan’s arrival was long overdue, but he finally arrived. After entering the company, Chen Shi notified everyone through the project group, "Another one has gone up again, it should be the last one."</p>
 <p>After waiting five minutes, Lin Dongxue replied, "He didn't come in."</p>
 <p>"He didn't come down either, so get a few people to search for him!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi ran into the company. The company had no other exit, but half a shoe print was clearly left on the wall under a window on the first floor. Obviously, he had fled from there to the alley behind the company.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sent a message while running out, "He fled to the alley!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went to the back alley. The alley was facing both east and west. He chose to go east. There were more people there. When he got to the street, Chen Shi looked around and found that Zhuo Xuan was standing in a clothing store. Chen Shi walked over and greeted, "What are you doing?"</p>
 <p>"I’m just about ready to go to the company," Zhuo Xuan said calmly. "Is there something you need from us?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, something came up." Chen Shi's eyes fell on his feet. "Why did you suddenly think of buying shoes?"</p>
 <p>"When did the police even manage this sort of stuff?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pulled out his cell phone and sent his location. Soon everyone came. Zhuo Xuan seemed a little nervous. He said impatiently, "What do you want to check? I still have something to do!"</p>
 <p>"Sorry, I'm afraid you have to come with us!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi reached out and suddenly grabbed Zhuo Xuan's right hand. He thought that because Zhuo Xuan's hand was bitten by a dog, he used the left hand all the time, but Zhuo Xuan didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue said, "What are you doing, Old Chen? There’s so many people around. Don't mess around!"</p>
 <p>"It's the leg!" Chen Shi suddenly understood. "Your leg was bitten by a dog, so you recently bought anti-inflammatory and painkillers, right? Do you dare to take off your pants and let us see?"</p>
 <p>An expression of alertness appeared on Zhuo Xuan’s face. "Why? If you want to arrest me, take out the evidence!"</p>
 <p>Obviously, the prey was in front of him but couldn't be arrested. Chen Shi was a little annoyed and said, "Look! He hasn't left the store. Find his shoes and see what else he has to say!”</p>
 <p>Everyone went to find it, but somehow they couldn’t find Zhuo Xuan's old shoes. Chen Shi noticed a sneer on Zhuo Xuan's mouth, and he thought about it from a different angle. <em>What is the safest place to hide it?</em></p>
 <p>A customer who left with a bag fell into Chen Shi's line of sight, and Chen Shi suddenly understood that the shoes were put into a customer's bag by Zhuo Xuan and were taken away unconsciously.</p>
 <p>If Zhuo Xuan couldn’t be arrested here, he was afraid they would have to take a lot of detours. Chen Shi gritted his teeth and said, "Leave someone to monitor him! Everyone else needs to go and find the shoes. He’s put them in a customer’s bag!"</p>
 <p>When he said this, Zhuo Xuan showed a hint of panic. Chen Shi thought secretly, <em>Sure enough!</em></p>
 <p>The team went to find the shoes. Every time they saw someone in the crowd carrying this store’s bag, they looked like they found treasure and ran towards them to inquire about the contents of the bags. Finally, Lin Dongxue stopped a customer at the bus station. He didn't know the bag had an additional box of old shoes.</p>
 <p>"Found it!" Lin Dongxue said excitedly in the group chat.</p>
 <p>"Go back to the clothing store!"</p>
 <p>The team rushed back and Lin Dongxue handed the pair of shoes to Chen Shi. Chen Shi smelled the soles of the shoes and sneered. "It's him who has such a heavy fishy smell on his shoes."</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan still resisted. "I don't know what you're talking about. How can you prove that these shoes are mine? And what about it even if they are mine?"</p>
 <p>"We will slowly explain this to you when we go back, Mr. Zhuo. Come back with us and cooperate with the investigation!"</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chen Shi sent someone to Cheng Yan to bring her back. The two were separated for interrogation. Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue were sitting opposite Zhuo Xuan. Chen Shi said, "You are very good at hiding things."</p>
 <p>Zhuoxuan looked at him coldly.</p>
 <p>"Explain! Where were you on the evening of February 2nd? What did you do?"</p>
 <p>"I said so already. I was playing games at home."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi held up his phone with a picture on it. "Is this motorcycle yours?"</p>
 <p>"No."</p>
 <p>"Okay, it seems that you’re not yet used to this place. You should stay here and think about everything by yourself while we talk to Cheng Yan.”</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi stood up, he noticed Zhuo Xuan's clear expression of panic. His lips parted a bit, but he closed them again.</p>
 <p>When they got outside, Peng Sijue arrived and said, "There were three different blood samples in the bag containing the dog's body: dog blood, blood of the deceased, and an unknown blood sample. After DNA identification, this blood sample is Zhuo Xuan's."</p>
 <p>The rock weighing on Chen Shi’s heart fell to the ground and was lifted away<span id="footnote-ref-dfa8"><a href="#footnote-dfa8">[1]</a></span>. "The truth is just a piece of window paper away. Let’s poke through it!"</p>
