 <p>Chen Shi picked up the picture of Ji Chunma sandwiched in the case file. It was a fat man with fair skin and small eyes, making him seem very shady.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sighed. “If this ransom wasn't given away in the first place, there wouldn't have been a case of spontaneous killing over greed.”</p>
 <p>He wasn't talking to himself. While he was looking through the case file, Peng Sijue was silently holding a tray and seating himself opposite of Chen Shi. Peng Sijue had a pet peeve and didn't like to eat with a bunch of people, so he only had lunch at three in the afternoon.</p>
 <p>Smelling the sweet and sour pork ribs, Chen Shi unconsciously picked up chopsticks and grabbed a piece to eat.</p>
 <p>“If I remember correctly, the money was marked by the police. How did he escape with the money for five years?” Peng Sijue asked as he picked up his chopsticks.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi spit out the bone of the pork rib. “Maybe the bank didn’t take note of it? But this guy isn’t a fuel-saving lamp. He is an ex rich second generation whose father went bankrupt. Would six million be enough for five years? Especially since he bought a house in Long'an and raised two mistresses while in hiding?” He grabbed another piece of sweet and sour pork rib with his chopsticks.</p>
 <p>“The clues that are appearing now are telling us that this case has other hidden properties... I will beat you if you continue eating!”</p>
 <p>“I’m just taste testing for you.” Chen Shi shamelessly stretched out his chopsticks again.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue covered the bowl with his hand. “Thanks, but no thanks. Captain Lin found a very interesting video. Everyone is discussing it right now. Are you sure you don't want to watch it?”</p>
 <p>“It's not soft enough. It's not as delicious as I make it.” Chen Shi returned the chopsticks back to Peng Sijue.</p>
 <p>Looking at the few pieces of sweet and sour pork ribs left in the bowl, Peng Sijue smiled wryly. “Shameless guy... Hey, your case file!”</p>
 <p>“Help me return it to the archives room please. Thank you!” Chen Shi said without looking back.</p>
 <p>Everyone was watching a video in the conference room that was provided by the Bank of China. The video showed that from 9:30 to 10:00 last night, a fat man in a hat stood in front of the ATM to withdraw and deposit money repeatedly.</p>
 <p>“Who is this?” Chen Shi sat down next to Lin Dongxue.</p>
 <p>“Ji Chunma!”</p>
 <p>“His body is a bit fatter than five years ago. What a positive person to be able to put on weight while being on the run.” Chen Shi sighed.</p>
 <p>The bank video showed that the man kept a card belonging to Wang Xifeng and kept depositing and withdrawing 10,000 yuan until the daily withdrawal limit was reached. He stood like this for half an hour in front of the ATM.</p>
 <p>There was a kind of scamming trick that spread over the Internet. By sticking double-sided tape to the banknotes, depositing them and taking them out one by one, it was possible to stick extra banknotes together to withdraw more.</p>
 <p>Some police officers also raised this conjecture, but the bank confirmed that the ATM had not lost any banknotes.</p>
 <p>The video had been rewound and played a few times. Everyone was whispering and discussing what this guy was doing. Did he like to hear the sound of banknotes popping out of the ATM to relieve stress?</p>
 <p>“Wait!” Chen Shi said. “Rewind it a bit... Okay, pause!”</p>
 <p>Everyone focused on Chen Shi. He pointed at the projection screen and said, “What is he doing?”</p>
 <p>“Looking at the money!” Lin Qiupu said puzzledly.</p>
 <p>“Play it at normal speed.”</p>
 <p>The video played normally. After watching this segment, nobody could pinpoint any problems regarding it.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi noted, “It took him a minute to look at the money. Does it take so long to count the money?”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, “What do you think he is looking at?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi remembered what Peng Sijue said just now about the money with special marks and suddenly got inspiration. “Exchanging money!”</p>
 <p>“He’s looking to... exchange money?”</p>
 <p>“Go to the Bank of China and find out whether there’s bank notes with the numbers recorded by the police.”</p>
 <p>At this time, someone ran in and said, “Captain Lin, we’ve made an important discovery. The person who put money into Wang Xifeng's account is called Shi Sijin. He deposits on average every three months with a minimum of 100,000 yuan and a maximum of 500,000 yuan over the past five years.”</p>
 <p>“Five years?” The whole room was shocked. This was the amount of time that Ji Chunma was out in the public as a fugitive for the murders.</p>
 <p>The man continued to report, “We checked and Shi Sijin was an employee of Fenglaiyi Media Company five years ago. We called him through the bank. He said he had left the media company long ago and is currently working at a preschool. His monthly income is only 6,000 or 7,000. He claims to have no knowledge of the existence of this credit card.”</p>
 <p>“Someone has stolen his information to create the card.” Lin Qiupu said.</p>
 <p>“Fenglaiyi Media Company? Why does the name sound so familiar?” Chen Shi pulled out his mobile phone for a quick search. The information that popped up on the webpage surprised him. The president of this company was the friend of the first son of the Lu family - Jia Xingyun.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pondered, “Mr. Jia has been depositing money for a fugitive for five years. Why is there a taste of him being blackmailed in this?”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu was so excited that when he stood up, he knocked the chair over. He chose a few people and then instructed, “We'll meet Mr. Jia now.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stopped them in their tracks. “Wait a minute, Mr. Jia’s father is an official. Since we don’t have clear evidence, it may cause troubles for the task force down the line if we find him right now. It’s best to let me go. First, I am not a police officer. Second, I have met him several times.”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu considered it and felt that Chen Shi was right. He said, “After you see him, if you feel it’s necessary, I will send someone to monitor his whereabouts.”</p>
 <p>“No, it's for protection! If Ji Chunma's extortion target is Mr. Jia, and now for some reason Ji Chunma has done such an extreme thing, his next goal is likely to be Mr. Jia.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi called on Lin Dongxue to go together with him. Mr. Jia took quite a liking to Lin Dongxue. With a beauty in front, he might open his mouth and tell them something.</p>
 <p>It was already 5:00 in the evening when they got to Jia Xingyun’s company. Chen Shi stopped the car there but did not get off immediately. Lin Dongxue asked curiously, “What are you hesitating for?”</p>
 <p>“I suddenly thought… Could it be Jia Xingyun? What would be his motivation? Is it necessary to see him right now?”</p>
 <p>“How would you know without asking?”</p>
 <p>“Will he say so when asked? Especially such an eloquent official second generation.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue put one hand on Chen Shi's shoulder and said, “Isn’t it more convenient to ask Old Man Lu about his sons instead?”</p>
 <p>“The father is often the one who knows his sons the least. He may not know anything.” Chen Shi sighed. “Let's just go and just say hello.”</p>
 <p>Unlike the eldest son of the Lu family’s “participation-focused” film and television company, Jia Xingyun’s media company was really profitable and operated in a sound manner. It was rumored that Jia Xingyun had decided not to mix in with politics ever since he returned from studying in the United States. Instead, he started his own company.</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun was young and handsome with an enviable family background and a high degree of education. He was a self-made, single CEO. For the majority of girls, he was like a CEO that came out of a story. The number of girls wanted to marry into his family could destroy the door frame as they stampeded their way in.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered the company, Chen Shi saw several beautiful female employees. Lin Dongxue waved her hands in front of Chen Shi’s eyes and said, “Aiya, aiya. I always thought you were an uncle that wouldn’t be tempted by things like this!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi argued, “I'm just thinking, wouldn't these beautiful girls come to work in this company with ulterior motives?”</p>
 <p>“No matter why they came, it’s also a means to attract talented people to the company.”</p>
 <p>When they got to the front desk, the beautiful front desk lady said, “CEO Jia is not in the company right now. He left quite a while ago.”</p>
 <p>“Do you know where he went?”</p>
 <p>“I'm sorry, I don't know!”</p>
