 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi sent away two more policemen. The investigation had been going on for over two weeks. The police knew that there was no evidence, but they kept coming to visit his house. They were as annoying as flies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He sat back on the sofa, drank his beer, and thought about what was amiss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why did the police persevere and refuse to give up? Did they have other investigative directions, or had new evidence emerged?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These thoughts made him uneasy as he irritably paced around the house, as if a swarm of hornets was swarming around him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He heard the sound of a car coming down the road and looked down from the window. He saw Su Chan driving her car back from outside. She was wearing sunglasses, a scarf, and a small bag as she slowly made her way upstairs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi turned off the lights and hid by the door. When Su Chan entered the house, he suddenly hugged her waist from behind, pierced her delicate cheek with his hard stubble, and asked jokingly, "Honey, where have you been? Out partying?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan was startled and asked, "You didn't go to the company?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you not happy to see me?" Lu Qi put her down and his enthusiasm dropped. He could feel that Su Chan had become colder to himself recently, and some changes were happening subtly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He absolutely could not be like Dong Xiao, who was kept in the dark until a catastrophe was imminent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where did you think I went? Having an affair?" Su Chan unhurriedly asked in a naughty voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmph, let me check it out!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi picked up Su Chan, threw her on the big bed, and ripped off her brand-name clothes randomly. After some venting, Lu Qi sat on the bed with a lot of sweat and lit up a cigarette. His sweat-drenched hair was draped on his forehead. There was a gloomy and dangerous look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since Dong Xiao's death, he had been walking on thin ice every day. Under such high pressure, his sexual desire had become stronger and stronger, and he would explode if he didn’t get catharsis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But just now, Su Chan didn’t cater to him as enthusiastically as usual. This indifference made Lu Qi feel a lump in his heart. He was afraid of losing her, so he grabbed her hand and said, "Su Chan, I have had many women in my life, but my love for them combined is less than ten thousandth of what I have for you. Do you know how much I value you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I love you too, I'm just too tired today." Su Chan said, touching his cheek, as if she was calming a giant beast.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi showed a silly smile and kissed the back of Su Chan's hand. After some kissing, he wanted her again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I just went to see a policeman." Su Chan said calmly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi stopped moving, raised his head, and laughed. "I saw two of them just now as well. Don’t say anything!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have something to show you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan pushed him away, got out of bed, turned on the computer, and played a video. From the angle and the screen, it was a candid shot. On the screen was Su Chan and a man who looked like an engineer. The engineer said, "The body can't be put into the rocket completely. It's too big and heavy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"President Lu spent so much money on hiring you, but you answer in this way?" Su Chan said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No! At first you said that the 'cargo' was only 200 kilograms. You didn't even let us know what it was. You only let us see it when the core compartment was ready, and it was 300 kilograms. Now it’s impossible to modify the plan. Anyway, it's impossible to put all this stuff in the rocket."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then how do you want to solve it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Could you please tell Mr. Lu..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you dreaming?" Su Chan yelled, "Why did Director Lu spend over 10 million to build this rocket? Just to launch this thing into the sky. Now you tell him that the rocket can't carry it? With his temper, he’d smash your heads open on the spot."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The engineer shuddered in fright. "What should we do... Or, can we take out a part of the corpse and reduce the weight? That way, Mr. Lu won’t know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do it yourself. Don't let Director Lu know, let alone the police! You must be tight-lipped about this matter."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I know, I know. We’re being given money to work. We'll keep the matter silent!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the end of the video, Su Chan was smoking a woman's cigarette leisurely and observing Lu Qi's reaction. He was stunned. He was dumbfounded looking at the screen and remained motionless for a long time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He always thought that Dong Xiao was in the sky right now, so he appeared so confident in front of the police. He said, "Which part was taken out?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don’t know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who is this person? I'm going to find him now!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re being mindless right now. The police must be watching you closely. Wouldn’t you be exposing yourself if you went to find him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi sat down, held his head in his hands, pondered for a moment, and asked, "You didn’t let others see this video, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why did you record it? Why did you only show it to me now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"To make a deal!" Su Chan smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Deal?" Lu Qi's heart flicked. He remembered what the police said that day. They said Su Chan was a commercial spy. He took it as a joke and didn't even want to offend her by asking. He believed that his love with Su Chan was strong and pure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You have the document for the new mobile phone motherboard. Give it to me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What can I get out of this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Safety!" Su Chan said with her crisp voice. "I won’t give this video to the police and they won't know that there’s still a part of the body left here. When everything passes, you can continue to be the director that you are."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi laughed bitterly and angrily. He didn't expect his favorite woman to say something like this. "This is not a deal. It's a threat!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have spent too much time on you and Dong Xiao. I don't want to drag it out anymore." Su Chan's tone showed exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re comparing me to him? You compared me to him!" Lu Qi stood up angrily. "I loved you so much. It turns out that everything was fake. You’re using me, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan felt terrified, but deliberately pretended to be calm. She said, "Lu Qi, my love for you is real, but my mission is also real. I must get that."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is your love for me real?!" Lu Qi roared, glaring at Su Chan with a twisted face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I love you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You liar! You liar!" Lu Qi sounded like he was abusing himself. He was even more angry when he heard the other party say that she loved him. What he was looking forward to was a cruel and bloody answer, so that his anger could have a reason to release.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You liar!" Lu Qi grabbed Su Chan's neck and lifted her up. Su Chan was hung in the air, struggling in pain. Her hands tightly grabbed Lu Qi's hand. Her slender fingers were as weak as a blade of grass when compared to his big hands that resembled iron pliers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Love turned to hate. The betrayed Lu Qi just wanted to choke Su Chan to death and break her neck. He was full of anger and he wanted to destroy everything he owned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A man rushed in unexpectedly, and strangled Lu Qi's neck with the drape on the sofa. Lu Qi let go of his grip and roared like a gorilla. Cao Man behind him was very clever and remained in a position where Lu Qi couldn’t reach him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan took the opportunity to grab vases, pottery horses, pen holders, and other objects on the shelf to smash them on Lu Qi's head. This broke Lu Qi's heart. He stared at her with a pair of bright red eyes, making Su Chan's heart tremble. However, in the end, he still fainted. He looked like a T-rex who had been knocked down and fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan looked in the mirror. There was a scarlet mark left on her neck. She looked at Cao Man. "Why are you here?"</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If I didn't come, you'd have died. If you want to make a deal with a monster, you have to ensure your safety first, okay?" Cao Man wore a smirk and glanced at Su Chan.</span></p>
