 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue was getting a bit angry. Who was this woman trying to fool? She said, "You said you didn't see Dong Xiao that day. You obviously called him. We found Dong Xiao's DNA in your hiding place, but we didn’t see him alive nor find his corpse. How could you have never seen him?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan casually leaned back on her chair and said, "Let me tell you a story! There was a woman from a humble background who was favored by a general. The woman's father had her betrothed to the general's godfather, a tyrant, to achieve his own goals. The beloved woman became his ‘mother’, and the general could only sneakily try to find this woman. Of course, paper cannot contain the fire. One day, things were revealed. The tyrant got angry and rushed to catch the adulterers. He wanted to kill the general, but he was old and fat. Even if he had a weapon in his hand, he couldn't beat the general and was quickly killed. The general made a decisive decision and killed all of his subordinates. Then, he used a fire to destroy all the evidence and took his beloved woman to escape.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was basically the same as Chen Shi's speculation. This was the most cooperative that Su Chan could be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi didn’t ask who the characters in the story were, and Su Chan wouldn’t answer anyway. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have told it as a story. He only asked one question: "Does Lu Qi love you that much?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Probably... You have to ask him yourself. Can I go now, officers?" Su Chan smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The police had no evidence to prosecute Su Chan, so they had to let her go. She made a phone call, and then a car came to pick her up. Lin Qiupu paid special attention to the license plate number and asked someone to investigate it. It was a buddy of Lu Qi’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Su Chan left, Peng Sijue returned from the scene. Everyone surrounded him in concern and asked what he had found. Peng Sijue said that the physical evidence he brought back still needed to be identified. He asked someone to remove some items from the car. It was the remains of the launch tower and the discarded outer shell of the rocket. It took a lot of effort to retrieve these things. It can be said that it was the most laborious scene surveyance they’ve ever done.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to the high temperature during the rocket launch, there were no clues on them, but a woven bag was found on a truck carrying the rocket to the scene, and some of Dong Xiao's DNA was found in it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dong Xiao was taken to the scene, and as the rocket lifted off, he also disappeared cleanly. Anyone could think of the connection. Dong Xiao "rode" the rocket and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Did the body enter the universe now, or is it in orbit?" Lin Dongxue asked. She felt a little absurd when she said those words. She actually had to discuss such a case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's definitely still in orbit. It’s probably orbiting around us." Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mm, I don't quite understand. This rocket went straight to the sky. Why would the contents become satellites? There’s nothing on the corpse." Xu Xiaodong was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you know about Newton's law?" Peng Sijue asked, "Things thrown from the earth have only three results. They get captured by gravity, escape from gravity and fly into space, or become satellites of the earth. After the rocket continues to accelerate, it finally reaches the first universe speed. The wreckage after it burns out of fuel will definitely become a satellite."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong looked as though he kind of understood and murmured, "That's incredible!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "So is Dong Xiao scorched or frozen right now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Either way, we won't be able to collect the corpse."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't understand. The fuel used to launch the rocket burns up to thousands of degrees, which can completely burn Dong Xiao so much that there’s no residue left. Why would Lu Qi do such a thing?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi smiled. "For him, not only does he have to win, but he needs to win beautifully! He’s very masculine. The term masculinity, if made more specific, can be said to be a big boy, childish and self-willed!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu said angrily, "Look at his arrogant appearance. His nostrils are almost upturned towards the sky. It’s the first time I’ve encountered such a crazy suspect."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If we’re talking about that, I think I'm quite masculine." Xu Xiaodong suddenly said before taking the brunt of Lin Qiupu’s glare.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu stood up and said, "Let's start the interrogation!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sitting in the interrogation room with Lu Qi and his lawyer, Lu Qi was enjoying beef and red wine. He ate whole beef tartare and the corner of his mouth was covered with blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the police coming in, he greeted them with food in his mouth, wiped his mouth, leaned back on his chair, and said, "It's finally started. I almost died from waiting. Hurry up and question me. When it's over, I have things to do."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu was so angry with this arrogant attitude and it took a lot of effort to suppress himself. "Where did Dong Xiao go?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I put him in the rocket and he was launched into the sky with a 'shoo', hahahaha!" Lu Qi smacked his thighs and laughed. He was unexpectedly honest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer was terrified and quickly interrupted him with a cough. The lawyer explained, "My client made a joke. Of course this isn’t true."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Of course it's true!" Lin Qiupu raised his voice, "Besides, I can't think of where the corpse would otherwise be. It's quite a sum, Mr. Lu. An unprecedented sum spent."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you dare to write it down? Do you dare to write it down?" Lu Qi sneered and threatened. "Aren’t you afraid I’ll retract the confession? Do you have evidence? Can you take out any evidence?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu gritted his teeth in anger. Indeed, he could retract his confession at any time if there was no evidence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Qiupu continued to ask, "What happened in Fengyi Court on January 20</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The lawyer wanted to speak for him but Lu Qi stretched out his hand to beckon him to shut up. He said with a grin, "I went to see my little lover. I didn't know Dong Xiao would come over. He discovered our relationship. In fact, Dong Xiao is despicable. In order to test my loyalty to him, he allowed me to take care of Su Chan every day. I’m not a vegetarian. How can I not try my way with her? Thus, we got intimate without considering the consequences. Dong Xiao found out and ran over to catch us adulterers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"And then?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s catching adulterers. What good can happen? Su Chan and I had just finished having sex and we were smoking cigarettes on the bed. Dong Xiao and Secretary Li ran in, cursing, saying that I was ungrateful, a white-eyed wolf, etc. He was really crazy that day. He unexpectedly climbed up to the third floor in one go. He usually needs someone to help him up any floor."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Did Dong Xiao carry a gun that day?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know about that."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You have a gunshot wound on your body. Won't you admit it? We can examine your wound."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lu Qi made an impatient expression as if he couldn’t be bothered with the trouble. "Okay, okay, don't bother. I admit it. Dong Xiao shot me but missed the fatal point. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here right now! Hahahaha!" Lu Qi thought he was funny and let out a dry laugh like a hyena.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The gunshot was shot by Secretary Li. Why did the gun fall into the hands of Secretary Li? Why did an outsider who accompanied Dong Xiao shoot? What happened at that time forced him to shoot!" Lin Qiupu questioned in order to corner him. He watched Lu Qi's increasingly nervous expression and added, "By the way, Secretary Li wasn’t burned to death. He escaped."</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cold sweat came down between Lu Qi's frowning brows. He didn't know that Secretary Li went crazy. Through Lin Qiupu's suggestive remark, Secretary Li seemed to have explained everything to them. This made Lu Qi panic. He actually missed this...</span></p>
