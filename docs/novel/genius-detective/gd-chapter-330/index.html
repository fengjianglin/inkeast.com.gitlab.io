 <p>Tao Yueyue asked in surprise, “Sister Gu, why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Gu You said, “I have been following you the whole time. Did you not notice it at all?”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue shook her head and secretly admired Gu You's stealth. She said, “The security has found out. What should I do?”</p>
 <p>“I told you not to do anything extra. Come with me.”</p>
 <p>Gu You pulled Tao Yueyue back to the community, went to a car, and the two got in the car. Gu You took off her jacket and put it over Tao Yueyue’s body, making her pretend to sleep, and then drove out of the community.</p>
 <p>When passing the gate of the community, the security guard only glanced into the car and let them go without any doubt.</p>
 <p>After leaving successfully, Gu You said to Tao Yueyue, “I parked my car here in advance just in case. When you simulate a crime, you must be prepared for a back-up plan.”</p>
 <p>“Have you been discovered before?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Gu You took out a perfume bottle. “Ether inside is used to deal with this situation.”</p>
 <p>“Wouldn’t the target wake up and call the police?”</p>
 <p>“Like the one today, most of the targets I choose will not report to the police. He’s a scum of the earth who scams people out of their donations. I have long suspected him.”</p>
 <p>“Simulation crime is actually to punish such people?” Tao Yueyue said excitedly. “Like a hero!”</p>
 <p>Gu You stroked her head, “No, we are just doing this to enjoy the crime, but we don't want to really break the law... There are two kinds of people in this world. One is the defender while the other is the destroyer. The former is to maintain order and reality, the latter is eager to break everything. Both you and I are the latter. The more things that are wrapped in taboos, the more tempting it is, so the more we want to go beyond the rules and taste the forbidden fruit.”</p>
 <p>“Who do you mean by ‘we’? Sister Gu, I always thought that you were a mysterious person. Are you somebody from a mysterious organization?”</p>
 <p>Gu You laughed, “It's just an interest group. We post tasks to each other and simulate crimes in the city at midnight. Most of the members of the group have high levels of education. They do these rebellious things for different purposes. Some people do this to relieve stress, some do it for the feelings they receive, and some do it as a means to attack poison with poison.”</p>
 <p>“What's its name? Does it still exist?”</p>
 <p>Gu You's eyes revealed a sense of sorrow. “We were originally a Garden of Eden. Everyone followed the rules and never went beyond... Until one day, a poisonous snake came in!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue listened with interest, looking forward to the rest of the story.</p>
 <p>Gu You smiled lightly and said, “I can't tell you everything yet. We will continue to play this game. When a certain time comes, I will tell you everything, okay?”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue nodded.</p>
 <p>Gu You said, “Lockpicking is just an introduction. Starting tomorrow, I will teach you some hacking methods.”</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Tao Yueyue clapped. She was full of expectations for this dangerous knowledge.</p>
 <p>On May 20th, Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue went to a beef noodle restaurant to eat noodles. Lin Dongxue asked, “Who is that Gu You? Why does Captain Peng know her so well? How did they meet?”</p>
 <p>“Gu You? That psychiatrist?” Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes. You know her?”</p>
 <p>“She lives next door to me.”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Lin Dongxue was surprised. “Why have I never met her?”</p>
 <p>“I can take you to see her next time.”</p>
 <p>“No need, no need. To be honest, I don't like her very much.”</p>
 <p>“Why? Envious?”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Am I the jealous kind of woman? I think she’s put walls around her and her nature is hidden really deep. Captain Peng must not fall into her trap.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it, Old Peng is-” Chen Shi stopped before he talked about the matter of Peng Sijue going to her clinic to treat depression. It was better not to spread it around, so he rephrased, “He likes men.”</p>
 <p>“Oh!” Lin Dongxue choked on hot pepper sauce out of surprise. “Really?”</p>
 <p>“I don't know. I haven't verified it yet.”</p>
 <p>“Then, you should go verify it!” Lin Dongxue smirked.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stared at a certain place, then lowered his voice. “I’ve been followed recently.”</p>
 <p>“How do you know?” Lin Dongxue glanced back without seeing any suspicious characters.</p>
 <p>“You’ll know right away... Waiter, the bill please!”</p>
 <p>The waiter said, “Sir, someone has already paid for your bill.”</p>
 <p>“Thank the gentleman for me then.” Chen Shi nodded. After the waiter left, he reluctantly said to Lin Dongxue, “See? No matter which restaurant I go to recently, someone will help me pay for it.”</p>
 <p>“What the hell?!” Lin Dongxue smiled. “I also hope someone ‘follows me’ like this. Then, I will eat hot pot every day... Oh, who is it anyway?”</p>
 <p>“Who else!”</p>
 <p>Ever since he rejected Wang Haitao’s luxurious thank-you gift last time, Wang Haitao has turned on shadow gratuity mode. No matter where he went, someone would sneakily pay for him immediately. One time, he brought Tao Yueyue out to buy clothes. After trying on some items and not liking them, they were about to leave when the shop attendant told them that the items they were looking at were already paid for. Chen Shi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi nowadays could walk into any consumer areas without taking money with him.</p>
 <p>But this was not a good thing for him. He found it very annoying. He said to Lin Dongxue, “It’s not like I’m acting high and mighty and don’t want his villa. It’s just that I didn’t think that the service I provided was worth that price.”</p>
 <p>“But from his perspective, you saved his life!”</p>
 <p>“This is just my job. Just like doctors who provide medical services, pancake stall owners who provide pancakes, and bars that provide wine, the police provide security and freedom. This 'commodity' is as important as health, food, and happiness. If only one officer gets such a high personal remuneration, it’s too unfair to the doctor, pancake stall owner, and bar owner. Anyway, the 'commodities' that the police provide are already paid for by the taxpayers... Although I’m not a police officer, the logic still applies! I solved the case and Captain Lin gave me a bonus, which is what I deserve.”</p>
 <p>“You’ve said that Captain Peng likes to reason about life. Don't you dive really deep into these big life principles as well?”</p>
 <p>“When talking about Old Peng, Wang Haitao's salvation is the credit of the entire task force and the entire second team. This includes Old Peng, you, and your brother. That’s even more reason why I shouldn't receive this benefit. I’m not qualified. If he gives everyone a villa and Lin Qiupu took the lead in collecting it, then I’d have no opinion about it.”</p>
 <p>“What a way to think! You want us all to play the role of the shameless character? Actually, I just want to say that if Wang Haitao wanted to repay you so much, you can give him a chance. Just take some symbolically. You’re not a policeman anyway. Didn’t you accept Old Man Lu's money last time? It’ll save him following you around every day. It’s as if you are the target of an unrequited love... Don’t you want to be acquainted with rich people?”</p>
 <p>“No matter if they are rich or poor, I treat them equally. Just like when I send passengers to their destinations. No matter how excited we are talking to each other, I’ll never contact them again because my service is over. Our fate ends there... Why can’t this fool understand this concept?”</p>
 <p>The waiter came again, put down two glasses of strawberry milkshakes and said, “The gentleman who just paid your bill picked these out for you two.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi felt helpless and said, “Thank him for me!” while Lin Dongxue tried to hold back her laughter.</p>
