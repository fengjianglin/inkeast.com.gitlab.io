 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi checked the tableware Wei Yi normally used and checked the cigarettes he smoked. While investigating it, Tao Yueyue pulled the corner of his clothes. "There’s a milk box outside."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A glance at the door showed that there was a small box for delivering milk. The box was made up of wooden boards nailed together and had a lid with a lock on it. Chen Shi asked Wei Yi to open it. Wei Yi said, "Is there any problem with this milk? I drink it every day."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "I will take it to the Public Security Bureau to test it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mr. Chen, I also wondered if I had a strange disease or got a virus. I’m very cautious of the things that go into my mouth. Even if it’s milk, I only drink it after heating it up every day. I think there shouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wait for the test results to come out in two days. Wait patiently at home."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah? Then I have to suffer from nightmares for several more days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Relax, I think the one who is secretly causing mischief doesn’t plan to kill you. Ah, yes, don't drink the milk tomorrow. Put it in the refrigerator and wait for me to get it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, thank you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi returned to the bureau without stopping. Peng Sijue was busy and as soon as he heard that he had to help him with the test, he was very impatient. Chen Shi said a lot of nice things before Peng Sijue put some of the leftover milk in the bottle under the microscope.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He immediately concluded, "There’s something in the milk. Like bacteria... No, it’s bigger than bacteria. It seems like a kind of creature."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let me see!" Chen Shi walked over to see that there were many cells in the form of bacilli swimming under the microscope. The number was extremely large. That shouldn’t be the normal probiotic bacteria in milk. He saw Tao Yueyue looking curious next to him. He asked, "Do you want to see it too?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is it okay?" Tao Yueyue looked at Peng Sijue’s serious face in fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's okay, come over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi asked Tao Yueyue to stand on the chair and she watched it in excitement. Peng Sijue's face became more and more tense. "I need to work. Take the child to play elsewhere!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aiya, have some love in your heart, okay?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get out!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Old Peng, take the time to help me test it. I’ll invite you to dinner later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have to be able to make time for it. Do you know how busy I’ve been recently?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can't you work overtime? Look at your hair. It's still a long way from being completely bald. Work some overtime!" Chen Shi said as he moved his hands and feet around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's the door. Get out!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After being chased away, Chen Shi still begged him, "Please! I’ll invite you to eat Japanese food later on."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon leaving the bureau, Chen Shi called Wei Yi and told him that the milk was indeed tampered with. In order to prevent him from alerting the other party, the milk should be kept every day going forward, and the empty bottle should still be placed in the box.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, he contacted kk and asked him to investigate the milkman. If convenient, he could install a spy cam in an inconspicuous corner of Wei Yi's door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After eating something simple, the two went to the spot where Wei Yi witnessed the zombie. This was a secluded street. To be precise, it was a road that connected a certain housing district to the road, so there weren’t many people at night. There were small shops on both sides of the road. They were basically all closed at night. Only the Fumanduo Supermarket’s lights were lit. Through the glass door, the owner could be seen playing Dizhu<span id="footnote-ref-eab4"><a href="#footnote-eab4">[1]</a></span> on the computer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi opened the map on his phone. "There aren’t any banks or gold shops within half a kilometer."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue immediately understood what he meant. "Uncle Chen, do you mean to say that they may not be robbers?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I don't think it's a robber. According to a robber’s mentality, they won't dress up before they reach their destination. There are surveillance cameras on the road that would photograph them. It's too conspicuous to wear a zombie mask on the passenger seat unless their goal is this small supermarket."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This is a tobacco and alcohol supermarket. It’s worth stealing from."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But the other party wasn’t wearing the clothes like that of robbers. Wei Yi said that the woman he saw was a long-haired woman in red clothes. This image appeared repeatedly in his dream. He shouldn’t have lied to us. Except for robbers, what else do you think is possible?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue thought for a while. "It was the corpse itself?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, this corpse wasn’t placed in the back seat, nor in the boot, but was carefully dressed and put on the passenger seat. This explains two points. First, the back seat and the boot may have more important things placed there, but what is more important than the corpse? Perhaps the driver wasn’t going to throw the body away, but was just transporting the body. Second, since they dared to put the body on the passenger seat, it indicates that they aren’t afraid of being caught by surveillance cameras. There may be no surveillance cameras along the way."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Or perhap Wei Yi lied! He may not have seen it in the passenger seat, but in the back seat."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It was so dark. How could he have seen a well-dressed corpse sitting in the back seat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue looked at the car parked on the side of the road. "Maybe he dived into the car. For example, the driver got out of the car and left their phone there with the window open. He wanted to take advantage of that, but saw the ‘person’ sitting in the back seat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, you’re thinking too specifically."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Isn't it right?" Tao Yueyue was looking forward to Chen Shi's evaluation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi patted her head. "It’s not entirely impossible. After all, all our reasoning is based on Wei Yi's own narrative. It’s well-known how unreliable people's memories are. People can close off their memories to defend themselves and doubting the objectivity of the other parties is also understandable.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Listening to your tone, you don't plan to adopt my reasoning!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’ll adopt it! But our investigation needs to go from what’s close to what’s far. Let’s investigate this housing community first and then expand out, okay?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This small road connected the east and north gates of the housing district. Chen Shi went to the north gate of the community and asked the security guard in the duty room for information on the rental houses. The security guard didn't know much about it. Chen Shi gave him 300 yuan and asked him to help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi asked again, "Right, this door doesn’t have a surveillance camera, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The security guard replied, "It hasn’t been installed yet, mainly because the owner felt like going to the supermarket on the north side was a massive inconvenience if they had to take the long way, so they temporarily opened this door. So, the monitoring hasn’t been installed yet."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, I understand. I’ll trouble you regarding this matter then."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Of course, of course!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi pulled Tao Yueyue away and Tao Yueyue said, "I think I may not be able to be a police officer. I have to talk to strangers when investigating a case. I may not be able to."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Investigations are originally very boring. Sometimes, after a long time, you’d find that it’s a dead end. You can’t bear that sense of frustration without an iron heart."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But you always find the key immediately."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi shook his head with a smile. "It might seem easy to others, but whether it’s easy or not can only be known by that person. Let's go to the next housing district."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Across the road is the community where Wei Yi lives, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I was thinking that the person who transported the body might live in the same community as he does! Are you tired?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Not tired. I feel very happy to investigate the case together with you." Tao Yueyue smiled.</span></p>
