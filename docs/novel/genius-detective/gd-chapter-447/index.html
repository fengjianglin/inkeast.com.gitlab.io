 <p>The echo of the gunshots filled the car again and Ms. Yuan’s contemptuous sneer could be heard over the phone. "Big Fei, you will pay for your words and deeds today. In fact, I’ve already proposed a divorce long ago, but he’s unwilling to do it. Do you know why? Because he knows that he’s not a rich second generation now. He knows that if he leaves me, no one will support him with his food, drinks, and fun. He relies on my support but he feels like he doesn’t have face. Are you just using this as an excuse to let it all out today?”</p>
 <p>Pointing at his mobile phone with the smoking pistol, Brother Fei shouted, "You transferred all the assets so that even if we divorced, I wouldn't get much. You bitch. You sucked the blood of my family dry and now you’re turning your face and not recognizing people? You’re having a happy time playing around every day. What about me? I can only drink and play games at home. I don’t have a sliver of a man’s dignity at all!”</p>
 <p>"Big Fei, listen well. A man who has no dignity has nothing to do with his woman. That is his own ‘credit’! Without me, what kind of life do you think you’d be living now? You can go ahead and kill and set fire. That would be even better for me. I can get rid of you that way. When you go to prison, I won’t visit you even once. I’ll just pretend you’re dead!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu anxiously said over the radio, "Hang up the phone. This woman is agitating him!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi raised his voice. "Your wife is right. If you can put down the gun now, this matter can be properly resolved. If you really kill someone, the only one who loses the most is yourself... Ms. Yuan, if your husband puts down the gun, could you please hire him the best lawyer? It’s a matter of life and death right now!"</p>
 <p>After a long silence on the phone, Ms. Yuan said, "Big Fei, listen to the police and put down the gun. I will find a lawyer for you and help you with bail procedures."</p>
 <p>Brother Fei cried and tears streamed down his whole face.</p>
 <p>Ms. Yuan said, "Be obedient. I will buy you the car you’ve always wanted. Before you go to jail, I will allow you to go and find a prostitute once."</p>
 <p>"I... A man like me... No dignity at all ..."</p>
 <p>"Didn't you always want that Maserati? Driving a Maserati and taking a club lady for a ride. How happy!"</p>
 <p>Brother Fei knelt down while crying. The gun in his hand fell to the ground and Chen Shi took the opportunity to grab the gun. He said over the radio, “The danger has been lifted!”</p>
 <p>There was a burst of laughter over the phone. "Big Fei, you should really go die!" Then, she hung up.</p>
 <p>"You lied to me! You lied to me!" Brother Fei rushed over to grab the phone as if it was his wife. Several young guys stood up immediately, pressed him to the ground, and kicked him with their feet angrily as if venting.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi shouted, "Don’t do that! Do you want to go to jail?"</p>
 <p>The police then arrested Brother Fei. When he got into the police car, he cried intensely. "I... Living like this... I might as well die..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi tried to encourage him. "It's better to be alive than to die. You ate such fragrant soft rice<span id="footnote-ref-dd7f"><a href="#footnote-dd7f">[1]</a></span>. A lot of people would be envious!"</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Brother Fei cried even more violently. Chen Shi said, "You haven’t had lunch yet, right? Would you like us to buy you takeaway?"</p>
 <p>Brother Fei nodded while crying. "I want a coke and fried chicken."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Xu Xiaodong to buy a meal at a nearby fast food restaurant. Brother Fei kept crying in the car as he grabbed at the food to eat with his hands in handcuffs. Lin Dongxue saw this scene and whispered, "He’s really a giant baby!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, it was finally resolved peacefully ..."</p>
 <p>Outside, a group of police officers rushed onto the bus. It seemed that something had happened. The two of them got out of the car and inquired about what was going on. They were informed that a fight had broken out.</p>
 <p>When they asked for the reason, they found out that among those male employees who had “personal contact” with President Yuan, several of them had girlfriends who also worked in the company. They didn’t know about these kinds of things until today and immediately tried to settle it with their boyfriends.</p>
 <p>The police finally mediated for them. The female employees who had been cheated on broke up with them on the spot and walked away in anger, leaving their ex-boyfriends whose faces were scratched and their hair ripped out to reflect on what they did.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked at the bus with emotion. "Green bus<span id="footnote-ref-3cfa"><a href="#footnote-3cfa">[2]</a></span>. How environmentally friendly!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue poked at Chen Shi and said, "You’re not allowed to do this in the future."</p>
 <p>"I’ll use this lesson as a reference! I’ll use this lesson as a reference!" Chen Shi smiled.</p>
 <p>Back in the bureau, Lin Qiupu called Chen Shi to the office and said, "The man who hijacked the bus this time was not on the list."</p>
 <p>"Really?"</p>
 <p>"Actually, we just investigated and found two of the people in the photos. They didn't know anything about the pistols. They didn't seem to be lying."</p>
 <p>"Sure enough, the photos are fake ..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought that Zhou Tiannan was not so stupid to have put the evidence at home. He should have predicted that Chen Shi would use "improper" means, so he prepared fake photos to prank them.</p>
 <p>Such effort was enough to prove that he took part in this case, but evidence obtained like that couldn’t be used as evidence in court, nor could they prosecute him.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu sighed. "Zhou Tiannan really is very cunning. In fact, according to the information we found, he has no flaws at all."</p>
 <p>"We’re going to be busy again... By the way, the batch of paparazzi always seems to arrive at the scene in advance. I want to do a small test to see if they’ve eavesdropped on the police radio or have a list on hand."</p>
 <p>"How do we test it?"</p>
 <p>"It’s simple! We need to operate a false alarm."</p>
 <p>"Right now?"</p>
 <p>"Right now. Dongxue and I will go to stand by and wait for the rabbit."</p>
 <p>"You have so many tricks like these."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu picked up the phone and called the police department to make the necessary arrangements. Then, an internal call reached the office to inform everyone that there was a hostage situation at Liyang Road. The officers who were eating hurried out and prepared to leave. Chen Shi said, "Fake. It’s fake. This is in order to catch the paparazzi. You guys can continue to eat. Dongxue and I are enough."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue laughed. "You’re not harming anyone but me alone? I haven't even finished my meal yet!"</p>
 <p>"You can eat lunch on the way there!"</p>
 <p>"No, let’s go. It’s good to eat less.”</p>
 <p>The two got into a police car and the police station reported the police code over the radio seriously. Then, they arrived at the scene. After waiting there for a long time, the paparazzi didn’t show up. Chen Shi said, “Then we’ve confirmed it. They have a list in their hands!”</p>
 <p>"Those guys are very sly. Would they admit it? And even if there is a list, how do they determine when something will happen?"</p>
 <p>"You're right. I didn't think about that. I’m guessing that they’ll wait in a potential area for the incident to progress and then wait for something to happen... Check where the red car is right now!"</p>
 <p>"That requires a lot of manpower to check. We can't rely on the two of us alone. Right, I’ll tell Captain Lin.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue informed Lin Qiupu about it. After listening, Lin Qiupu said, "No, our manpower is very tight right now. It’s impossible to assign someone to investigate this. If we don’t find them, who will be responsible for the hostage cases?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi gestured to Lin Dongxue and took the phone. "If we can get the list, we can prevent the hostage cases in advance. Wouldn’t this sort it once and for all?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu was silent for a while. "I'm in charge of this case. I can't take this risk, but I have a compromise. The next time the batch of paparazzi reappears, you can tail them and find the other gunmen directly."</p>
 <p>"Doesn't that mean we have to wait for the next incident?"</p>
 <p>"It can only be done that way. This is the most secure way at present."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sighed. "Okay!"</p>
