<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>On April 6th, Chen Shi received a text message from Lin Dongxue and rushed to the scene. The text message just said, "Little Wei is dead. It’s a tragic sight." Little Wei was one of the nine men who had come to the bureau a few days ago as "a guest".</p>
 <p>Many policemen had already arrived at the scene of the crime, and there were some neighbors watching the commotion. This was an old-fashioned tube-shaped building. Chen Shi pushed his way through the crowd all the way to the door. At first glance, he saw a lot of bloody handprints on the wall. A man was lying on the floor and his entire right leg had been amputated. The blood that had spread all over the ground had already solidified.</p>
 <p>The head of the deceased was facing the door, and the bloody handprints were in the opposite direction. There was indeed a lot of blood on his body, as well as on his hands, but from the shape of his hands, he didn’t leave those bloody handprints.</p>
 <p>"Stop looking at them. The handprints are fake with a textile texture though the blood is real. The murderer must have stuffed a woman's glove with a sponge soaked in blood and used it like a stamp." Peng Sijue had already finished his inspection.</p>
 <p>"Woman's glove?! To inform us that this is Duan Lin's revenge? Could the murderer be the dismemberer?" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"We just saw the corpse, so don't rush to judge." Lin Qiupu said.</p>
 <p>"In that case, what did you call me here for?"</p>
 <p>"I asked you to come here in order to see the scene with your own eyes, so that you won't ask again later."</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, I won't draw conclusions yet."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi had always believed that Peng Sijue was more professional than him with respect to on-site surveys, and Lin Qiupu had always advocated for not omitting any details. With these two people at the scene, it was fine for him to just feel the atmosphere for himself.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue took a ruler to measure the length of the bloody handprint, and then retrieved a photo from the phone. When forensic pathologists took pictures of the corpse, they would put a colorful multifunctional measuring ruler next to it as a reference object. He said, "The size of the handprint is almost identical to Duan Lin’s hands."</p>
 <p>"It really has something to do with Duan Lin." Chen Shi nodded.</p>
 <p>The forensic police officers were taking pictures around the corpse. The deceased had several wounds from being beaten. There was a scratch on his forehead, and a small portion of a shoe print seemed to be visible. The right calf had been amputated from the knee. The cause of death was judged&nbsp;preliminarily to be&nbsp;excessive blood loss. If a person had a limb amputated, they would die if they didn’t receive first aid within 15 minutes.</p>
 <p>From the cross-section of the wound, the murderer had sawn off his leg with a saw and the knee-cap had been sawn-off directly. This was really cruel and most people wouldn’t be able to do it. There’s a patella on the knee, and cartilage under it. It’s not easy to&nbsp;saw&nbsp;it from the front. You will have to&nbsp;saw&nbsp;from the leg socket at the back to cut and tear the soft tissue in the space between the bones. Finally, the whole calf would have to be torn off. The process is hair-raising.</p>
 <p>However, the sawn-off calf of the body wasn’t found at the scene.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked, "Didn't the neighbors hear anything?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue replied, "The neighbors on the left and the right have been questioned. They only heard a ‘dong’ noise last night. They thought someone had dropped something. It was just this one noise, so they&nbsp;paid&nbsp;no mind to it."</p>
 <p>"So who discovered it?"</p>
 <p>"In the morning, a few elementary school students had kicked a football up into this building. They came up to look for the ball and then saw a dead person inside the house through the window."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked at the corpse and suddenly blurted out. "The murderer is a man."</p>
 <p>"Huh? It must be a man. A woman doesn't have the physical strength."</p>
 <p>"No, I'm not guessing. People like him won't bring women to the house, as it goes against his public persona. Look at the clothes he was wearing..."</p>
 <p>The deceased was wearing an undershirt with the words XX Fertilizer Factory and a pair of shorts that had faded white from washing. There were also leftover pancakes, a bottle of leftover beer, and a pack of five-yuan cigarettes on the table.</p>
 <p>What they saw in Little Wei’s WeChat previously were all these words like this - "Work hard, exercise self-control, and become a better version of yourself", "Today, I had lunch with the CEO of Yusi. It turns out that he’s also a Harvard alumnus, and we had a great conversation with each other." "After changing to a BMW335i, the sound of the L6 turbocharged engine is particularly pleasing to the ear.", "This nutritious meal after going to the gym is only $19.7."</p>
 <p>"He wouldn't meet a woman dressed so casually. The murderer is most likely a man." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"Perhaps it was an acquaintance..."</p>
 <p>"Yes, it is very likely that it was an acquaintance..." Chen Shi suddenly thought of something. "Eh? Where's his mobile phone?"</p>
 <p>"I couldn't find it anywhere." Lin Dongxue shrugged.</p>
 <p>"Previously, Duan Lin's cell phone couldn’t be found before either. If the murderer wanted to avenge Duan Lin, why did he take the cell phone away? This is very contradictory. There must be clues on the cell phone from which we can find out who killed Duan Lin. This person has worked tirelessly. Wasn't Duan Lin's body divided and posted to the nine people in order to make the police pay attention to this matter?"</p>
 <p>"Hey, you’re jumping to conclusions. Haven’t you already equated the murderer with the dismemberer?" Lin Dongxue commented.</p>
 <p>"Let's assume this hypothesis first, and then consider the possibility that they might be different persons."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue pondered for a while, walked to the wall and compared her hand with the bloody handprints. "My hands are similar to these. Most women have such small hands. You can't just carelessly assume that this was someone who was avenging Duan Lin. People like Little Wei have harmed many other women."</p>
 <p>"This view is very objective." Lin Qiupu nodded affirmatively, "Don't rush to associate this with Duan Lin's case. The appraisal hasn’t been finished yet!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, I won't say anything!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi originally had wanted to mention the method of death. Killing a person doesn't have to be so troublesome. A knife can solve the problem. Why did the murderer have to cut his leg off? Duan Lin had also been divided into nine pieces. Was this some kind of omen?</p>
 <p>Looking at this bloody scene, Chen Shi had a feeling that more cruel things would happen next.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue asked for the body to be bagged. At that moment, a mobile phone fell out of the deceased's shorts. The people at the scene were surprised. After that, the mobile phone was put into an evidence bag and taken back for inspection.</p>
 <p>When everyone&nbsp;was&nbsp;driving away from the scene, an uncle in a yellow coat suddenly stopped the police cars with a panicked expression.</p>
 <p>It turned out that this person was a nearby garbage inspector. He discovered that someone had thrown wet garbage into a hazardous garbage bin. Lin Qiupu said, "Uh, this matter..."</p>
 <p>"Look, this is it!" The garbage inspector took out a bag, and the police officers immediately became flustered when they saw the shape of the bag. After opening it for inspection, they found that it was a complete calf.</p>
 <p>"I was so frightened. I happened to see your police cars passing by. Aiya, thank the heavens!" said the garbage inspector.</p>
 <p>"You call this wet garbage!?"</p>
 <p>"Isn't this wet garbage?"</p>
 <p>Looking at the bloody calf in the bag, Lin Qiupu gave in. "Okay, it’s indeed wet garbage."</p>
 <p>"That's the leg of the deceased?" Chen Shi asked in the car.</p>
 <p>"I have to take it back for identification." Peng Sijue said.</p>
 <p>"What identification? Won't you know after gauging it?"</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue glared at him. "You should wait for the tests to be done before you participate in a case next time."</p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs">Chen Shi looked really enthusiastic. "The broken leg was thrown into the canister for hazardous trash. The tactic is a metaphor! The murderer is the dismemberer. I’m 100% sure now!"</p>
