 <p>Gu You slowly backed up into the consultation room and said, “I can admit that I am the butterfly that caused the storm, but for you to end up like this, it’s because you made the wrong choices, one after another. Ji Changxin, you are a pitiful clown. The biggest failure of your life is that your wife and daughter left you. You wanted to take control of your life but found out that you’re powerless. That’s why you chose this girl and acted like a savior to help her get rid of her bullies. Are you satisfied now that you were able to act out the role of a father?”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin's lips trembled. He stepped into the consultation room, gritted his teeth and said, “Do you know my analysis of you? You are proud, indifferent, and excellent on the outside, but deep inside you are a female pig longing to be whipped. There are dark secrets hidden deep inside your heart. You have never run this clinic seriously. You are always preoccupied with something. You came to this city for a purpose... Are you looking for someone? Someone that you’ve lost previously!”</p>
 <p>Gu You sneered, and the two experts who were good at analyzing exposed each other’s hearts.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin squeezed the iron rod in his hands, “Why do you hate me so much? Why do you have to harm me like this?”</p>
 <p>“I just hate people who don't follow the rules. You are the dregs of this industry, so I can't tolerate you.” Gu You said coldly.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin smiled and held up the blood-stained iron rod. “What happened in the last few days has benefited me a lot. It taught me a truth - no matter how deep and profound your knowledge and wisdom is, in the face of this game, it's all useless!”</p>
 <p>Realizing that the other party was about to take action, Gu You suddenly grabbed a handful of sand from a potted plant and chucked it onto Ji Changxin's face. Ji Changxin screamed violently, waving the iron rod and smashing the lamp and whiteboard.</p>
 <p>Gu You rushed into the office, braced a newspaper rack against the door, and hurriedly called the police. Ji Changxin slammed the door hard outside and rushed in after he had rammed the door open.</p>
 <p>Gu You grabbed something from the drawers and held it in her hand. When Ji Changxin rushed over, she shocked him with a stun gun. Ji Changxin rolled his eyes back and twitched. However, the stun gun had not been used for a long time, and the electricity barely lasted ten seconds.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin recovered and struck Gu You's shoulder with the rod. Gu You fell down. Ji Changxin didn't plan to let her die like this. He knelt down, pressed Gu You's carotid artery with his thumb, and started hypnosis.</p>
 <p>Soon, Gu You's eyes were dull. She was already hypnotized, and it was a state of deep hypnosis. Ji Changxin reached into her neckline and fondled her breasts. Gu You made no response.</p>
 <p>This was what Ji Changxin had wanted to do long ago. Of course, this was not the time. Ji Changxin knew that the police were searching for him everywhere. He accepted his fate, but he refused to give up without a struggle.</p>
 <p>What happened in the past two days made Ji Changxin realize his strength. Before he was arrested, he had a list of people whom he wanted to kill. All are those who had looked down on, deceived or bullied him.</p>
 <p>Gu You was right. Ji Changxin was eager to take control of his life. To this end, he had studied very hard from an early age, been admitted to a prestigious university, did his utmost to win the favors of his mentors, and stayed up late to write his dissertations. However, he had followed social norms and had never had direct control over his life.</p>
 <p>Now he understood that it was so easy to control everything. Humans are so lowly. As long as you killed one or two people, others would be afraid of you and listen to you!</p>
 <p>The police were coming. Ji Changxin heard them going upstairs. He handed the iron bar to Gu You and ordered, “Go to the door and wave it around. Don't stop without my instructions.”</p>
 <p>Gu You's sneer appeared and Ji Changxin realized that something was wrong and was about to retrieve the iron rod. Gu You slammed the rod down on him and Ji Changxin screamed and fell down. Blood flowed from his head, and as he covered his wound, he exclaimed, “Why haven't you been hypnotized?!”</p>
 <p>Gu You pointed to her temples, “In order to set a trap and capture the evidence, that day I asked another psychiatrist to carry out a simple hypnosis on me. His instructions are still in my head. You cannot hypnotize a person who has been hypnotized. Just like how you can’t get a person who is already asleep to fall asleep again!”</p>
 <p>“You loathsome woman!” Ji Changxin was so angry that he kept losing to this slut.</p>
 <p>He was struggling to stand up and resist, when the police rushed in and pointed their pistols at him. “Don’t move!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin raised his hands helplessly and the police handcuffed him. Gu You hurried over to check on her colleague’s condition and called an ambulance. The police asked, “Ms. Gu, how is your injury? Can you go back with us to make a statement?”</p>
 <p>Gu You asked in return, “Can this person be sent directly to the bureau?”</p>
 <p>When Ji Changxin was brought to the bureau, Lin Qiupu and the others were quite surprised. The guy was arrested just like that, but the case was not over yet. Fan Lixue and Han Jingming were still missing.</p>
 <p>In the interrogation room, Lin Qiupu asked Ji Changxin, “Did you hypnotize Han Jingming?”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin sneered and began to hum the tune of “Cloudy Day”. “Yes, if she hears this, she would go to a place and jump down from there!”</p>
 <p>“Where?”</p>
 <p>“Do you think that I would tell you?”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu slammed the table, “Ji Changxin, don't be so stupid! The first few girls were killed by you, but Han Jingming is different. She was called out by Fan Lixue. If she dies, it means that this girl killed her. You see her as your daughter. Do you have the heart to let her go to jail?!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin's expression wavered for a moment, and then returned to indifference. “This is her own choice. I only gave her the push button.”</p>
 <p>No matter how much Lin Qiupu questioned, Ji Changxin was reluctant to respond. Lin Qiupu could only let the police officers who were still outside look for them. Given that Han Jingming had been away from home for five hours, Lin Qiupu felt that there was no need to look for her near her home. The place must be far away.</p>
 <p>During this time, Lin Dongxue and Xu Xiaodong were at Fan Lixue's home. They had run around the whole day without even drinking a sip of water. Fan Lixue's mother burst into tears and couldn’t be consoled. After Lin Dongxue received the news from Lin Qiupu, she could finally comfort Fan’s mother and update her on the situation. They asked her to think about where the two children might go.</p>
 <p>Fan’s mother said. “The two of them are in the same school district, so they attended both elementary and junior high school together. Could they have gone to the elementary school?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, “It's unlikely. Han Jingming has walked for five hours, so it must be a farther place. Fan Lixue also knows this place... It’s already dark, so the place should be open to the public.”</p>
 <p>Xu Xiaodong wondered, “Is it the park?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue had a headache. There were so many parks in Long’an, and it’ll be too late if they had to search them one by one.</p>
 <p>Fan’s mother said suddenly, “Go and check the unfinished buildings on Madang Road... No, I'll go with you!”</p>
