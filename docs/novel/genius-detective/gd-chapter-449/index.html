 <p>While Lin Qiupu was negotiating, Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue had been looking for the red car outside. They didn't expect to actually find it. The car was parked in a corner where it wasn’t noticeable. There was no one in the car when they found it.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "This group of guys reacted really fast and arrived ahead of the police again."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi glanced back. "Even when confronted, they won’t admit that they have a list!"</p>
 <p>He blocked the light with his hands and looked into the car. There was a device in the car that was constantly flashing a red light. It looked like it was used for eavesdropping. If this wasn’t used to eavesdrop the police, who would it eavesdrop?</p>
 <p>Chen Shi suddenly understood and asked Lin Dongxue to follow him. He returned to his car and picked up a bug detector to bring to the building where the incident was occurring.</p>
 <p>At this time, the corridors were full of policemen holding guns and waiting. The family in the house were arguing with each other. Chen Shi made a mute gesture to the officers behind him and went towards the door quietly, holding the detector across the door. The scan showed a suspicious signal in the dried wormwood hanging above the door.</p>
 <p>He put on gloves and pulled out a wireless bug from the dried wormwood. He removed the battery. Lin Dongxue was suddenly exclaimed, "So that’s how they got their information!"</p>
 <p>"Let’s go. Let's follow them."</p>
 <p>The two drove away from the neighborhood and lay in ambush nearby, waiting for the red car to come out. Then, they’d immediately follow them.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was a little worried and kept saying, "I wonder what’s happening with my brother."</p>
 <p>"Relax, he's fine."</p>
 <p>On Lin Qiupu’s side, the three children counted out each other’s faults. The more they quarreled, the fiercer they got. Lin Qiupu’s head swelled up<span id="footnote-ref-8878"><a href="#footnote-8878">[1]</a></span> just from hearing them. He interrupted them, “Everyone, everybody. Let’s get back to the topic at hand. I want to ask how this incident started today."</p>
 <p>The three looked at each other. The eldest son took the lead in saying, "Isn't it my mother's birthday today? Look, the cake on the ground was ordered by me early in the morning. Then, while eating, something unpleasant..."</p>
 <p>The younger sister said, "My eldest brother was going to make an investment, so he was concerned about my mother's demolition funds and mentioned it at the dinner table. That’s why things became like this.”</p>
 <p>The eldest son rushed to say, "Don’t frame me. This wasn’t because of me. At least I’m not like some people who secretly encouraged Mom to make a will. The reason I said that today is to take advantage of everyone being in the same place and let you all know my opinions. Second brother wanted to use this money to buy a house and you want to use it to buy photographic equipment. I’m looking to make an investment. I talked to Mom and said that I’d pay her back with interest within three years. Not only would I not give her a penny less, but she’d make a profit.”</p>
 <p>"God knows what’s going on with your investment. We don't know which friend is fooling you again. I really believe it. And you want to take our mom's demolition money into it." The younger sister sneered.</p>
 <p>"What are you saying? As if my investment is fake or something."</p>
 <p>"Isn't it fake? What kind of business did you run previously that made money? In the end, you just scammed your family!"</p>
 <p>The second brother whose wife had died just kept crying. He suddenly said, "Sister, don't make yourself sound like a white lotus<span id="footnote-ref-31fa"><a href="#footnote-31fa">[2]</a></span>. The three of us fought for the money at the dinner table today. We kept saying, ‘After Mom dies…’ over and over again. Not one of us is better than the other, white lotus!”</p>
 <p>The eldest son and the younger sister stopped quarrelling at the same time. Lin Qiupu asked, "What happened after that?"</p>
 <p>The younger sister said, "Later, second sister-in-law said some things which basically meant that Mom was biased and always favored the eldest son. You must know that my second sister-in-law's speech towards her has always been unpleasant. Even words of praise from her mouth seemed to come with thorns. Mom got angry and pulled out a gun out of nowhere. At first, we thought it was Fengfeng’s toy. Who would have expected the gun to sound and second sister-in-law to fall down in that moment?"</p>
 <p>The younger sister glanced at the corpse on the ground. There was only shock in her eyes and no sorrow.</p>
 <p>Old lady Wei, who hadn’t spoken the entire time, said, "Weren’t you all worried about my demolition money? Now that I’ve burnt the property title, you all won’t get anything. Even if I can get the money in the future, I’ll donate it all to charities. I won’t give a dime to you three unscrupulous children!"</p>
 <p>The eldest son said, "Don't, mom! You can't let outsiders have this unjust gain. At least we’re your own children. Blood is thicker than water!"</p>
 <p>"Shut up! I've long since understood you three!" The old lady pointed the gun at the eldest son and shouted. The eldest son held his head and lay on the ground in fear.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu was speechless. Even now, the eldest son was worried about money.</p>
 <p>Old lady Wei looked at Lin Qiupu and said, "Officer, you should have a general understanding of the situation. This was all my fault. I shouldn't have given birth to these three white-eyed wolves<span id="footnote-ref-7bb3"><a href="#footnote-7bb3">[3]</a></span>. They only think about how to tear these old bones of mine to shreds and eat it all day long. Originally, I wanted to say that I would divide the demolition money into three parts for them. Who knew that they’d quarrel with each other? I got so sad from listening to them, and then my second daughter-in-law said something so unpleasant. I got impulsive... "</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, "Old lady, why don't you put the gun down first before talking about it? I know that this gun was given to you by someone with ulterior motives. The purpose was to cause what’s happening today. You can't let him succeed."</p>
 <p>Old lady Wei looked at the corpse on the ground with her lips trembling. "I’ve already killed her. No matter what you say, it’s all too late… I just wanted to send these three unfilial things to see the old man and then commit suicide!"</p>
 <p>With that in mind, she pointed her gun at the eldest son, who shouted, "Mom, don't! Give us another chance. We’ll definitely change!"</p>
 <p>"Old lady, old lady. Don't be impulsive!" Lin Qiupu persuaded her sincerely. "No matter what, they’re your own flesh and blood! Even tigers don’t eat their young."</p>
 <p>"Yes, tigers don’t eat their young. To be forced to do this today, you should also know how they usually treat me... They all hoped for me to die in order to divide my inheritance. Now, you won’t get anything.” Old lady Wei’s eyes were determined.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the problems in this family had intensified to an irreconcilable point. Lin Qiupu changed his methods. "How about this? Who are you most willing to let go? No matter what, should we let one of them out first?"</p>
 <p>Old lady Wei pondered and pointed at her youngest. "You don't care about me, but you never abused me. You can leave with your boyfriend!"</p>
 <p>The younger sister got up as if she’d received amnesty and said, "Mom, don't be impulsive!"</p>
 <p>"Go!"</p>
 <p>The two hurried out and the older sister-in-law said, "Mom, this is your Zhang family's business. I don’t want to participate in this as an outsider. Fengfeng is still waiting for me outside!"</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, old lady Wei pointed her gun at her and said, "I want to kill you the most! If it weren't for your private complaints, would my son become like this now?"</p>
 <p>"Mom, how can you blame me for that? Your son was just like that. You don't know how unpleasant his words are in private..."</p>
 <p>"Shut up!"</p>
 <p>The eldest slapped his wife's face and then said to his mother, "Mom, I know that when you were in my house, you suffered a lot because of this woman. If you want to kill her, you can do it. I definitely won’t stop you!"</p>
 <p>"You actually..." The wife's eyes widened.</p>
 <p>Old lady Wei actually listened to him and immediately raised her gun to point it at the older sister-in-law.</p>
