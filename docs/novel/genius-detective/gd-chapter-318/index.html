 <p>Fan Lixue’s consciousness felt as if it was being covered up with a milky-colored plastic bag, where she couldn’t hear any outside sounds. She could only hear this uncle’s voice talking to her, and she could only follow his instructions. She desperately struggled and resisted, wanting to wake up from this sleep-like state.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, it seemed as if a small hole was broken in the "plastic bag". Fan Lixue saw an uncle with a perverted face. She screamed for a long time until she was fully awake. She found that she couldn’t move her limbs, then realized that she was tied up.</p>
 <p>The uncle looked down at her, smiling lecherously, as if the corners of his mouth were about to have drool dripping. Fan Lixue was trembling with fear. Her first reaction was that this must be another evil prank that Han Jingming had planned.</p>
 <p>This time... This time, she has crossed the line!</p>
 <p>The uncle reached out and began to unbutton her blouse. Fan Lixue felt a cool breeze on the skin of her chest, which made her panic and scream desperately, "Help... Help..."</p>
 <p>Then she realized that there was a TV in the room, and the volume was so loud that it completely overwhelmed her voice... She was wondering why she hadn't noticed the sound of the TV at all earlier.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin put a finger on his lips and made a gesture for her to stop screaming. "If you make another noise, I will plug your mouth."</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue shed tears and curled up as she trembled. "What do you want to do to me... I don’t have anything on me..."</p>
 <p><em>Silly girl, don't you know that you are a treasure in the eyes of others?</em></p>
 <p>Ji Changxin slid his hand inside Fan Jianjian's clothes from below, stroking her flat and smooth belly. It felt really good to him. His heart pounded madly since he had not touched a woman for so long.</p>
 <p>"Uncle... Uncle..." Fan Lixue trembled like a wet baby chick. "Can you let me go? Please... You can take my cell phone and wallet... Please let me go! "</p>
 <p>"Fan Lixue, what did you see at the subway station?" After asking this, Ji Changxin regretted it a little. He shouldn't use the other person's name. The girl was just prey tied up by him that will be killed directly after being raped. He shouldn't treat her as a person.</p>
 <p>When it came to rape and killing, there was a sliver of uncertainty residing in him. Could he really do such a thing?</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue responded, "I... I just saw a classmate!"</p>
 <p>"Lies!" Ji Changxin’s face was solemn. "When children lie, they need to be punished."</p>
 <p>He began to take off her bra as she struggled violently. At that moment, Fan Lixue’s mobile phone began to buzz non-stop, annoying Ji Changxin. Do young girls’ phone prompts need to be set so loud?</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin left Fan Lixue alone for the time being and took out her mobile phone from her school bag. It turned out that a WeChat group was chatting enthusiastically, and a student named Han Jingming was saying, "Wow, do you guys know what I saw at the subway station? A man fell off the platform and two other men went to rescue him. In the end, all three were killed by the train. Wow, the scene was full of blood. So scary!"</p>
 <p>This was a class chat group, and there were a bunch of people who responded, "Do you have photos?""Pics or it didn’t happen!"</p>
 <p>Han Jingming posted several photos, which were indeed taken at the scene.</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue curled up into a ball and trembled. "Uncle, did Han Jingming ask you to come and harass me?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know anyone by the name of Han Jingming."</p>
 <p>"She... She often bullies me at school... So, I ran away when I saw her."</p>
 <p><em>Oh, so that was the case. What a blunder.</em></p>
 <p><em>But she was already tied up and touched. If I let her go, wouldn't I be in trouble?</em></p>
 <p>There was also a chat record between Han Jingming and Fan Lixue on WeChat, which had been sent at 5PM. Han said, "I have added music to your video. No need to thank me." A video was attached. Fan Lixue knelt down in a place that seemed to be a women's toilet. A stream of water kept pouring over her and someone was cracking up beside her. The video was set to trendy, electronic music. The whole video lasted about five minutes.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin was a little shocked. Would junior high school girls actually do this kind of thing?</p>
 <p>He continued to scroll upwards, and the chat records appeared before his eyes. "Smelly slut, I took a video to see how cheap you are!" "You went away as soon as you saw me. Why did you do that? Believe it or not, I’ll mess with you tomorrow.” “Did you tell the teacher about it? I rip your fucking mouth apart.” “If you talk about what happened this afternoon, I’ll throw you down from the rooftop.”</p>
 <p>It could be seen that this girl named Han Jingming had been bullying Fan Lixue for a very long time.</p>
 <p>"Don't watch, don't watch!" Fan Lixue didn't want her shameful affairs to be exposed to strangers. She cried and said, "Uncle, stop looking at my cell phone. You can hit and scold me. Just don't look at my cell phone. I beg of you!"</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin knew that his daughter was also bullied at school. That had happened after his divorce. The reason was his “reputation”. His daughter had been gradually isolated and bullied at school.</p>
 <p>But he couldn't do anything for his daughter at a time when he couldn’t even help himself, which was one of the reasons why his daughter hated him.</p>
 <p><em>It doesn't matter if I'm a molester or a sex maniac, you shouldn't touch my family!</em> There were countless times where he wanted to shout that to the entire world, but this world was unreasonable. Bullying the weak was the world’s law. An uncle molested a girl on a bus, which meant that anyone could step on him and bully his family at will.</p>
 <p>He looked at the girl lying on the bed. His daughter was about the same age, and Ji Changxin suddenly felt a strong wave of sadness. He sat by the bed, crying with his head buried in his arms.</p>
 <p>After crying for some time, someone handed him a tissue. Ji Changxin said his thanks and took it. He wiped his eyes and suddenly froze. He turned his head and looked at Fan Lixue.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the rope that tied her up was too loose. She had broken free long ago. Fan Lixue sat on the bed, watching Ji Changxin.</p>
 <p>She wasn't so afraid of him anymore. After all, Ji Changxin didn’t look that fierce. She said, "Uncle, you're a bit like my father."</p>
 <p>"Oh... Oh really? What does your dad do?"</p>
 <p>"White-collar work. He committed suicide when I was ten years old, and everyone around him said he was a criminal who was guilty of corruption."</p>
 <p>"So people bullied you at school?"</p>
 <p>Fan Lixue nodded silently, "In the beginning, everyone just ostracized me and laughed at me. Later, a few girls started to tease me and found that I didn't dare to resist, and they... They did a lot of extreme things to me... But I’m already in third year and will graduate soon!” Fan Lixue tried to squeeze out a smile, but failed. “As long as I endure 62 more days, I don't have to worry about them anymore!"</p>
 <p>"Stupid child, tolerating it will only make things worse."</p>
 <p>"What else can I do? I can't beat them, and I dare not tell the teacher. What can I do except endure it?”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin looked at her and it was as if he was seeing his own daughter. He had an urge to do something for her, so he said, "Do you know how the three people who were killed by the train died today?”</p>
 <p>"Uncle, are you teasing me? You also said that they were killed by the train..."</p>
 <p>"Do you think it was suicide or homicide?"</p>
 <p>"Suicide... I heard people say that the man wanted to die and killed the other two in the process."</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin grinned, "Would you like the people who bully you to commit suicide too?"</p>
