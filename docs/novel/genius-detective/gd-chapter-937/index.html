<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Seeing Old Man Lu suddenly draw his last breath, the "new son" panicked, let go and said, "This can't be counted as me killing him!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi rushed forward, snatched his knife, held his hands behind his back, and said, "Behave yourself!"</p>
 <p>Then he asked kk and Sun Zhen to come over and watch him. kk went up and kicked the "new son" in the groin. The “new son” held his groin as he squatted down in pain and Chen Shi questioned, "Why did you hurt him?"</p>
 <p>"How can we subdue him if I don't hurt him?" kk said as if it should be taken for granted.</p>
 <p>"Just pin him down on the floor.&nbsp;Haii, really..."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao was shaking Old Man Lu who had collapsed on the floor with tears raining down. Chen Shi went over to check, and when he put his hand under Old Man Lu's nose, he suddenly opened his eyes and sat up. His expression returned to his former arrogance, "Motherfuckers, you police are really useless. If I didn’t act out that scene myself, I don’t know how much more I would have suffered!"</p>
 <p>"Huh? Acting?"</p>
 <p>"What? Are you hoping that I’ll die?" Old Man Lu gave Chen Shi a scornful glance. "Support me to go and rest for a while."</p>
 <p>Later, the police hurriedly arrived and took all these people away.</p>
 <p>When Liao Chunhuang was taken away, he was still struggling incessantly. On the other hand, his subordinates were very obedient. They lined up and walked out one by one. All the magical tools at the scene were taken away as evidence of their crimes.</p>
 <p>Only then did Chen Shi have the opportunity to inspect the scene. There was a secret chamber hidden behind a pillar at the side of the room, which acted as a control room. The buttons on the table were labelled &nbsp;“Lights”, “Smoke”, “Sounds”, “Projections” etc. All you need to do is click, and the altar would produce the corresponding effect.</p>
 <p>"It's the same as a stage play. What a huge expense." Lin Dongxue said. "We should ask Old Man Lu to come and have a look so that he knows he has been fooled."</p>
 <p>"Leave this task to Wang Haitao. Let's go and bid them goodbye!"</p>
 <p>When they got to the lounge, the old Taoist priest was explaining "principles" to Old Man Lu. "In fact, the pursuit of longevity is a bad path, because human lifespans are determined by the heavens. Emperors and generals in ancient times failed in their quest for longevity, what more a common businessman like you. Ever since the beginning, the universe has been divided into three realms. This has its reasons. This human realm is like a school. If you learn well, you can go to the heavens to be an immortal after death. If you don't learn well, you will have to go to hell to do hard labour. After the death of the Yellow Emperor, Qiao mountain shattered and a divine dragon took him to the heavens. Anyone who has attained the Way can attain immortality and ascend to the heavens. There are now 5.3 billion immortals in the heavens, which is the same as our human realm. Immortals are just what we call them. The Barefoot Great Immortal and the Taibai Jinxing you know are civil servants among the immortals, and are called immortal officials. When you go there, you will be the most ordinary of immortals. You can take a wife to spend your life with and you can also do business. It doesn’t matter if you eat meat or drink, you can also gamble and find prostitutes in the heavens. Otherwise, what would the deities of gambling and prostitution be doing? All the pleasures in the human realm can be found in the heavens, but there’s one thing that’s even better. There is no exploitation there. Everyone is rich, and you won’t get sick or get old... So, it’s spiritual cultivation that is the right way!"</p>
 <p>Old Man Lu's eyes gleamed as he listened, and he patted Wang Haitao's hand. "I really learned about the Way too late. I've been fooled by that damn swindler for so long. I should have met this true immortal long ago. From now on, the company will be left to you. I’ll cultivate myself together with the old master. When I go to the heavenly realm, I will open a branch office up in the heavens. The people there are simple-minded and will just let me earn their money easily. I will be the richest one in the heavens. I won’t be an immortal official. I’ll become a god of wealth instead. What do you think, son?!"</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao could only humor him with a wry smile. "Very good, father."</p>
 <p>The old Taoist priest continued talking so avidly that Old Man Lu didn’t notice Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue coming in. Wang Haitao saw the two of them and walked over. "Mr. Chen, you saved us again. I really don’t know how to thank you!"</p>
 <p>"No, you don't need to thank me. I can't accept your thanks either."</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao glanced inside the room. "Although this old gentleman is also a big swindler, he is better than the last one. People still need some spiritual support, especially old people like my father."</p>
 <p>"You need to watch him carefully. Don't let this big swindler lead him into a trap."</p>
 <p>"It won't happen this time. Haii, my father's body is getting worse by the day. I also hope that his last moments will be lived out happily."</p>
 <p>"Take care, Mr. Wang."</p>
 <p>"Thank you!"</p>
 <p>On the way back,&nbsp;Lin&nbsp;Dongxue mentioned "I feel that contemporary people have a lack of faith. After Old Man Lu’s matter, I feel that even illusory faith is also meaningful. At least, it will let people become brave in the face of nothingness after death."</p>
 <p>"Do you think there’s nothingness after death?"</p>
 <p>"Otherwise, what else can there be? The brain stops working, so how can thinking exist?"</p>
 <p>"I don't think so."</p>
 <p>"You don't think so?"</p>
 <p>"In the past, people thought that there was a God because the world at that time was full of mysterious unknowns, and people felt that a greater existence must have created everything; now everyone thinks that there is no God, because we’ve been able to go to space and explore the deep seas, and the sky does not hold the palaces of gods. From this perspective, our thinking mode is the same as that of our ancestors, which means that one day what we think is correct will be overturned too! What is the truth like? Our imagination is limited to nothing more than aliens, multiple dimensionality, and time travel. These are like the gods that the ancients had fantasized about, extensions of themselves, and the real unknown is something we’re completely unable to imagine. If everything today is overthrown, including the atheism which has become common sense, in that case, is there a god in this world?"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue smiled, "I think you should also become a big swindler!"</p>
