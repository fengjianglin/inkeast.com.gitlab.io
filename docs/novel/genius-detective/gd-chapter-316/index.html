 <p>As Ji Changxin was pushing through the crowd and rushing out of the carriage door, several hands grabbed him from behind, and the crowd shouted, “Don't let the old pervert run away!”, “Kill him! I hate this kind of person most!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin struggled forward so desperately that tears came out. <em>Do you know what I experienced today? Why is the whole world against a man in his fifties?!</em></p>
 <p>The boy went over and kicked Ji Changxin's butt. This “help” caused Ji Changxin to collapse forward, and his suit was torn.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin stumbled and almost fell to the ground. He picked up his briefcase and ran away. He fled to the stairs in one breath, and then he took a big breath and covered his chest with his hand while panting. People passing by looked at him strangely.</p>
 <p><em>This society is so indifferent and cruel!</em> Ji Changxin complained silently. <em>And that was also the case back then. Just because he made a small mistake, he was filmed and the whole world abused, laughed and bullied him.</em></p>
 <p>That incident caused his wife to quarrel with him and ask for a divorce. His daughter was also awarded to his wife. Furthermore, he lost his job and had to move to another city to start afresh.</p>
 <p><em>I just couldn't hold back. I ejaculated onto the girl's skirt and didn't touch her body at all. Wouldn't you usually do this to your wife at home as well? Why are they so ruthless to me? Is it really because they have a sense of justice? Why not criticize the corrupt officials and bullies? To put it plainly, in the name of justice, they perpetrated violence on the Internet, at the expense of this old man who is unable to fight back!</em></p>
 <p>After swallowing down his bitter tears, Ji Changxin walked back to the lower level with a bleak heart, ready to take the next subway home.</p>
 <p>Before the subway came, he went to the toilet and was peeing with his head bowed when the man next to him snorted and stared at Ji Changxin, as if recognizing an internet celebrity.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin knew that this was not a good thing. After all, he had become infamous on the internet in the past, so he turned his face away.</p>
 <p>“Aren't you the old pervert from just now? Wasn't that you? Speak!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin didn't want to cause trouble and continued peeing with his head lowered.</p>
 <p>The “fan” next to him actually turned and peed on him, causing Ji Changxin’s pants and shoes to be drenched. Ji Changxin was shocked. He immediately zipped himself up, and the remaining urine all dripped into the inner layer of his pants. The warmth ran down his legs.</p>
 <p>The “fan” laughed, “Old pervert, you deserve it! We despise people like you who harass little girls the most. Come on, why don’t you hit me? Hit me then.”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin's face was distorted by anger and he said to himself that he would not stoop to this person’s level.</p>
 <p>“Motherfucker!” The other party was still scolding, “What a coward!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin left in a hurry and the other party was still scolding him from behind, “It’s obvious that you’re sexually repressed! You must not have a wife or children. Otherwise, they’ve run away. People like you should really get hit by a car when you go out!”</p>
 <p>“They’ve run away” hit Ji Changxin right where it hurt, so his nostrils flared as he clenched his fists tightly.</p>
 <p>He knew that he couldn't beat the other party in a fight, but he wanted to give this dumb guy a little lesson. So, he hid by the toilet door and waited quietly. He looked around and observed. It was currently the interval between two trains. The entire platform was vacant without any people.</p>
 <p>The surveillance camera also pointed in the other direction. All conditions were favorable.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll show him that I’m not someone to mess with!</em> He clenched his jaw.</p>
 <p>The “fan” came out unguardedly and his hands were still fastening his belt. He was completely unaware that Ji Changxin was standing beside him. Ji Changxin clutched his neck from behind, pressing his right thumb tightly on the pulsing carotid artery.</p>
 <p>The strong sensation of suffocation caused the man to struggle madly which resulted in a bloody scratch on the back of Ji Changxin's hand. Ji Changxin began to say in a low voice, “From now on, you can only hear my voice. Your mind is empty and only my voice echoes in it. You’re feeling more and more sleepy. More and more sleepy. When I count to three, you will fall into a deep sleep. One…Two…Three!”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin let go of his hands and the “fan” fell to the ground like a sack of flour. Ji Changxin sneered. <em>Do you know how powerful I am now? I have over a thousand hypnosis experiences under my belt. I’m the best hypnotist from XX University!</em></p>
 <p><em>Oh no, there’s someone coming down from above!</em> Ji Changxin immediately instructed the “fan”, “Stand up.”</p>
 <p>The “fan” opened his pair of lifeless eyes and climbed up from the ground. Ji Changxin snapped his fingers twice in front of him. The hypnosis state was not deep enough. He continued to intone the guiding words to consolidate the hypnosis state and bring him into a deeper level of hypnosis.</p>
 <p>Outsiders think that hypnosis makes people fall asleep. In fact, that isn’t the case at all. According to a paper that he wrote in college, hypnosis puts the brain into a beta sleep state, which is also known as the REM sleep state, in which the person is actually semi-awake.</p>
 <p>It’s just that the person who is hypnotized, and the hypnotist have a short-term relationship established between them in which all surrounding sounds are blocked by the subconscious. The hypnotized can only hear the voice of the hypnotist and execute his commands.</p>
 <p>Looking at this guy who had just humiliated him, Ji Changxin wondered how to deal with him. He suddenly had an excellent idea. Make him fall off the platform and be killed by a train!</p>
 <p>The punishments imposed on killers made him a little fearful, but after a bit of thinking, he realized that the surveillance cameras overhead would only record the man walking off by himself, so even the police wouldn’t consider it as murder.</p>
 <p>That’s it!</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin patted the man's shoulder, turned him toward the train tracks, and said next to his ear, “You are in front of a beautiful prairie. Can you see it? Ten meters in front of you, is what you want most. What is it?”</p>
 <p>“A house.” The man opened his lifeless eyes and spoke in a tone as if he was sleepwalking, “A beautiful house. Two floors. It’s so beautiful.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s a beautiful house. Do you see that floor-to-ceiling window?”</p>
 <p>“I do. It's so beautiful. Wow, a big swimming pool, and-”</p>
 <p>“What else is there?”</p>
 <p>The man laughed foolishly, “A hottie!”</p>
 <p>The sound of the train drew closer. It was time. Ji Changxin urged, “Go! The beauty is waiting for you! You can walk forward with confidence. It’s flat ground in front of you.”</p>
 <p>The man moved his legs like a wind-up clockwork toy, walking towards the big house and the beauty in his eyes, then fell straight down the platform. Ji Changxin smiled gleefully, but the smile stayed on his face for less than five seconds. Someone suddenly screamed, “Ah, someone fell down!”</p>
 <p>A boy who looked like a high school student rushed down first and then a volunteer wearing a red vest also jumped down. The two tried hard to push the man above to the platform. In the tunnel, the light of the train illuminated their fearful faces.</p>
 <p>All the passengers on the platform gathered and shouted, “Hurry up! Hurry up!”, “Give me your hand!”, “Hurry up, the train is coming!”</p>
 <p>“Stupid people! Just be crushed to death as well!” Ji Changxin said viciously to himself.</p>
