 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After listening to the other party, Yan Ke's eyes widened in surprise. "That's it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Not satisfied?" The other party looked at him with his head tilted. "Don't think that this matter is trivial. You must finish it perfectly as I’ve said."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I can do more. I won’t lie to you. I’ve killed someone before!" Yan Ke stared at the other party’s eyes, trying to act fierce and ruthless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other person smiled and shook his hand. "Okay, okay, I know you’ve got the skills. Don't be impatient. As long as you’re useful, Mr. Zhou won’t neglect you. You should complete this matter well!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then... goodbye."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Soon after Yan Ke left, another man sat in front of the black hat and whispered, "Mr. Zhou asked me to come."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man in the black hat nodded. "My task to you is..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the beef noodle restaurant across the road, Tao Yueyue furrowed her brows suspiciously. From where she was sitting, she couldn’t hear what the other person was saying, but she knew it was definitely not a good thing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unconsciously, Tao Yueyue sat there until very late. Chen Shi called and anxiously asked where she was. Tao Yueyue said, "I’ll come back immediately."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you with friends?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I... I had some matters."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Shall I pick you up?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, I'm in a noodle shop next to the school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Chen Shi arrived, the black hat in the cafe had already gone. He smiled in relief. "What’s wrong? You’re not going home after school. Who are you investigating?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue hooked her finger and Chen Shi sat down in front of her. Tao Yueyue showed him a few photos. The photos were taken with a mobile phone across the road and glass at an extended focal length. The quality was very poor, but a male with a black hat could be seen sitting with different people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I saw Yan Ke sneakily come out today and saw this person. Then, this person saw ten people one after another." She no longer called Yan Ke Teacher Yan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shichao glanced across the road. "Thank you for the information, but don't do such a dangerous thing next time. What would you do if you were found out?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It wouldn’t happen. I want to avenge Cao Rui. Didn't you say that there are other forces behind Yan Ke who are helping him? Could it be related to this person today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You can't afford to provoke those forces."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue said indifferently, "I’m originally a child. Who can I afford to provoke? Couldn’t I hide?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, okay, okay, you make sense... Have you eaten?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I ate three bowls of beef noodles..." Tao Yueyue burped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The next morning, the ten photos taken by Tao Yueyue were taken to the Public Security Bureau by Chen Shi. Due to the poor quality of the photos, the people in them couldn’t be seen clearly even after technical processing. Furthermore, the meeting place was tricky and avoided all the surrounding security cameras.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they really wanted to investigate it, it wasn’t impossible. They’d slowly screen them from the surveillance footage of the intersection, but with the flow of tens of thousands of people, it was unsure how long it would take to investigate, so they were afraid that it would delay the opportunity for battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu said, "The meeting of these people must have been arranged by Zhou Tiannan. He recently made a big move...Why can't you buy a clearer phone for Yueyue?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said helplessly, "I’ll give her a professional camera, and instead of going to school every day, she should just monitor Yan Ke and Zhou Tiannan? I already told her not to do this dangerous sort of thing in the future."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But this little girl's vigilance is pretty good. She does live with you after all. Speaking of which, I haven't met her yet!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "Captain Lin, if you meet her, you’d definitely love her. She’s smart and cute. A collection of the good traits of other people's children."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said proudly, "The child of my household!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu smiled. "Okay, okay, who doesn’t know what? Let's have the meeting!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The morning meeting was mainly about the progress investigating the Dahong Group and working with the economic police to find out many business crimes such as tax evasion, false invoices, and illegal financing in the Dahong Group over the recent years. To be honest, the criminal police weren’t interested in these. In contrast, the economic police’s eyes glowed in front of these accounts. They were very excited in their investigation. The criminal police only supported them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Our investigation has already been carried out for a week. At present, we have not found a substantial connection between the Dahong Group, the Qu Brothers, and Zhou Tiannan. There’s still no progress regarding the case of the shareholders disappearing back then.” Lin Qiupu concluded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was almost asleep from listening and leaned on the seat. "I think the connection is very simple. Zhou Tiannan only helped the Qu brothers to get to the position they’re in. The benefit they can give is money. Investigate it from that angle."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You talk as though it was easy. Look at the financial expenditure of a listed company over the year. It's like a bunch of messy ropes. It wouldn’t be made clear within a year and a half. By the way, today, the Qu brothers are going to sign a contract with a foreign company’s CEO. We don’t need to go today."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The police are investigating them, but they’re still conducting business? They’re businessmen after all. Money is prioritized since this type of investigation won’t have any impact on the company over the short term."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s great!" Lin Dongxue cheered. "We were originally investigating Zhou Tiannan, but in the end a company was dragged out. It’s been a headache over the last two days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We still have things to do today. We’ll continue to investigate the disappearances and the serial killings of ‘Zhou Xiao’ back then."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone agreed with a lack of enthusiasm. The cases that the criminal police didn’t like to touch were ancient cases where the evidence no longer existed. It was more troubling than archaeology.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi called Lin Dongxue to take a small trip away from work with him. They went to the hotel where the two companies signed the contract under the pretense of investigating. They saw many media cars outside and there were a lot of hired security guards. Lin Dongxue asked, "What are we doing here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"After all that investigating, I still don't know what the Qu brothers look like. I want to see them up close."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re still shamelessly saying that? You’ve been skiving off work the past two days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This kind of investigation is not what I’m good at. If there’s a bizarre case, I promise to be the first to rush forward."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Crow's mouth! I hope there won’t be a big case anytime soon. We really don’t know how to clone ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was said that this time when the two companies cooperated with each other, a certain urban area of Long'an would be redeveloped.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the signing ceremony was lively, it was also boring. The reporters were standing in the doorway. The two stood and watched from afar. There were a lot of flower baskets placed downstairs and a stage with a long table was set up. The two presidents would sign the documents here later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this moment, it seemed that a press conference was being held. A public bicycle suddenly came from outside the door. The person wearing a suit and riding a bike was Wang Haitao. After he stopped, there was a staff member that went up to greet him. The poor person riding a bicycle here was considered frugal. A rich second generation riding a bicycle was considered environmentally-friendly. His arrival immediately attracted the attention of many reporters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mr. Wang!" Chen Shi shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Haitao saw him, smiled, and immediately gave the bicycle to the staff to stop. He jogged over. "Go, go, go. The reporters around are very annoying!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three went to a milk tea shop and finally avoided the reporters. Wang Haitao said, "Mr. Chen, I haven't seen you in a long time. Thank you for your investment advice last time. I have made a lot of money recently."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You even gave people investment advice?" Lin Dongxue asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi smiled. "Mr. Wang said he wanted to invest last time and asked me for any suggestions. I said he could try projects that don’t seem like they’d make money. Unreliable projects are often wildly exaggerated. Those who sound like they don’t make money but dare ask for investment show that they really want that career.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Haitao said, "After listening to your suggestion, I invested money into drug research and development for rare diseases, scooters for people with disabilities, a new kind of streetlights, and pet grooming. I’ve basically all broken-even. Mr. Chen is quite the visionary."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How so, how so? I'm just a layman talking about it casually. It's your own good taste and luck."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Dongxue thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Chen Shi really dared to blindly make plans. Fortunately, the other party profited.</span></p>
