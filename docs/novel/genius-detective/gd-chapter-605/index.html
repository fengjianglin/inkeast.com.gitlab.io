 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said, "When I buy this house, you should terminate the rental of your current house. Just move in here with me. To be honest, I think it is not worthwhile for you to rent a house. You only sleep there every day and when you work overtime, the time you spend there is even shorter. In addition, you have to pay two thousand yuan a month."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue said, "What I buy with the two thousand yuan is a sense of security. Even when outside, I feel more at ease knowing I have a place to go back to."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Look, how about treating this as your home?! You can choose any of the three bedrooms."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lin Dongxue thought to herself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Was this an official proposal for cohabitation? The current relationship between the two was progressing, and it was normal to live together, but she wanted more than that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;She tactfully said, "I hope this place can really become my own home."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, then treat it as your home."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue furrowed her brows secretly. Didn't he understand what she meant? She had to muster up her courage to say those words. Just when she was about to express her dissatisfaction, someone came in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin discovered that there were people in the house and stood at the door in a daze for a moment, before displaying a professional smile, "Mr. Chen, are you looking at the house again?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I'm here to investigate the case today and I just came up to have a look on my way."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I know. A lot of police officers came to the sales department."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You came just at the right time. I have something to ask you. The police found that Zhang Haichang's cell phone contained a lot of messages sent to you, all with that kind of provocative content. He also said several times that he wanted to invite you to dinner. Did you agree?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How could I agree?! He’s a married man, and he’s so old."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But you didn't seem to have explicitly refused."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This is the difficulty in our line of work. Some buyers always make some unreasonable demands, but in order to sell the house, we can only perfunctorily assuage them. I have encountered this kind of harassment many times. Although I don’t feel very comfortable inside, I’m already used to it." After that, she glanced at Lin Dongxue, as if looking for understanding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue glanced at her phone. "Captain Lin is looking for me. I’ll go down first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She walked to the elevator and pricked her ears to listen to what Chen Shi was saying. Chen Shi was actually asking, "Miss Gong, have you ever slept with a buyer?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is this kind of question also for the investigation?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm curious!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue gritted her teeth with anger, entered the elevator and pressed the button fiercely, sulking with her arms crossed all the way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the room, Gong Jianqin shook her head. "I have principles and won’t have excessive dealings with my clients..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi stared into her eyes and ascertained that she was lying. It was enough to get this answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin asked, "Mr. Chen, I also want to ask you something. You’re not a policeman, but you always investigate crimes with the police. Do you have a particular background?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't have a special background. I’m just an ordinary citizen, but I'm fairly good at this."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good? And you can be a consultant just like this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ve solved more than one case. I have solved many difficult cases. Every case was twisted and bizarre, with hidden motives." After that, Chen Shi kept staring at her eyes and caught a momentary flash of panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gong Jianqin just showed a habitual smile. "It seems that you’re very amazing! I meet all sorts of people selling houses, but it’s my first time meeting someone like you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi withdrew his sharp gaze and smiled, "The launch is next week, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Correct."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"I don't quite understand the&nbsp;</span><span>matter of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;shared area. I read the guide that you gave me. It turns out that the house is actually only 180 square meters, and that more than 30 square meters is shared area. Can you explain it to me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's actually like this..." she explained patiently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When Chen Shi went downstairs, he found that Lin Dongxue had already left. He didn’t get to see her for the rest of the day.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Could she have gotten angry?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She seemed to have expressed her desire to get married just now in a roundabout way, but he had deliberately acted stupid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Tiannan’s death would bring about many changes. This is definitely not a good thing for him. Zhou Tiannan’s group of subordinates would get out of control, and vicious incidents in Long'an could occur at any time. Chen was sure about one thing. That group of people will target him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The memory of Han Luoxi's death back then was still vivid in his mind, and it had taken Chen Shi a long time to get over the trauma, mend his broken heart, and fall in love with Lin Dongxue. However, at this juncture, he dared not take the relationship further.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Because of his fear of suffering a loss again!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the evening, Chen Shi waited at the entrance of the Public Security Bureau and finally saw Lin Dongxue coming back. Upon seeing Chen Shi’s car, she deliberately turned a blind eye. Chen Shi got out of the car and blocked the way, saying, "I sent you a text message and you never replied. Are you angry with me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue glared at him, "So you know?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can explain that matter."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as she heard the word "explain", Lin Dongxue immediately became angry. An explanation meant there was a problem.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The anger that had been suppressed for a day had long been brewing in her heart, and only needed a light prod. Chen Shi actually stumbled into the gun muzzle by himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What's the explanation? That girl is pretty good. I saw the two of you talking and laughing together, and you seemed very happy. You don’t seem that happy when you’re with me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are you talking about?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You think I didn't hear it? You asked if she’s ever slept with someone who bought a house, and you’re buying her house now. Isn’t that suggestion obvious enough?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm investigating the case!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Yes, as long as it’s investigating a case, you can ask anything! Under the pretense of investigating a case, are you&nbsp;</span><span>having</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a good time meeting new 'friends'? Who told you to come to investigate the case? Do you think you are a policeman?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Did water flood your brain today?!"<span id="footnote-ref-c910"><a href="#footnote-c910">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My brain is flooded!" Lin Dongxue was so angry she wanted to laugh. "Who is Su Ruijuan?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Su Ruijuan?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You don't even remember? She was that fake Chen Shi’s girlfriend. Why did you two keep in touch after the case was over?! Explain it. Use your eloquence to explain it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Are you crazy? Wait, did you peek at my&nbsp;</span><span>cell phone</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't go off on a tangent! Tell me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi gritted his teeth with anger and didn't bother to explain this kind of misunderstanding. "You can go and calm down by yourself! Don't expect me to coax you, unless you apologize for spying on my privacy first!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go to hell, scumbag!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi got into the car, slammed the car door shut with a bang, and drove off. At night, he was so angry that he didn't even eat any food. Lin Dongxue sent many text messages with fierce expressions. As the saying goes, cursing someone wouldn’t yield good words. The two usually only had minor disagreements. This was the first time a major fight had happened. The main battlefield was on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After arguing until 10:00 in the evening, Chen Shi's fingers hurt from pressing the buttons. By this time, the focus of the quarrel was no longer on debating, but on hurting each other. Chen Shi recorded a voice message on the phone. "Lin Dongxue, I wish that you will never have any orgasms in your life!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue soon sent her greetings. "I wish that you’ll start balding from tomorrow onwards!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Usually, as long as Chen Shi was sitting on the sofa, Maoqiu would come over and rub itself against him. However, the cat was frightened by his hostility now and dared not approach. Chen Shi patted the sofa and shouted, "Come here and let me touch you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Maoqiu ran into Tao Yueyue's bedroom and Tao Yueyue popped her head out. "Uncle Chen, don't be angry, okay? Although I don't know why you two quarreled, it must be Elder Sister Lin's fault!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was gratified. "You still understand me the best. This damn woman relies on her good looks to blindly accuse me! It's too overboard! Don't become like this when you grow up!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Would you like to drink some alcohol to cool down? Or to do something else?" Tao Yueyue suggested timidly. She was also afraid of Chen Shi's angry demeanor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes! I don't want to think of these annoying things..."</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi ran to the kitchen, took out a kitchen knife and started to sharpen it with a sharpener. The ear-piercing ‘cha-rak cha-rak’ sounds of the knife getting sharpened made Tao Yueyue anxious. After ten minutes, he started cooking...</span></p>
