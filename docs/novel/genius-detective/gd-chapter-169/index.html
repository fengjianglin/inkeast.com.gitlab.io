 <p>The next day, Lu Zhendong didn't come back until 9:00 in the evening. Because Lu Zhendong couldn’t wash clothes, Cheng Yan was still wearing a dirty maid outfit to play in the house. She had invented a game where she fed salt marinated meat to the dog. After the dog ate, the meat would be so salty that it would squeal. Cheng Yan would then pour soy sauce in a bowl. The dog would be stupid enough to lick it and would scream louder. Finally, it would run to the bathroom and drink the water in the toilet bowl.</p>
 <p>Cheng Yan regarded this dog as Lu Zhendong and used it to vent her humiliation and anger.</p>
 <p>At 9:00PM, Lu Zhendong entered the house and told Cheng Yan to go back to her room to hide. It turned out that he had brought a guest back. It should be one of his friends. The two drank and chatted in the living room and from time to time there would be perverted laughter. Cheng Yan couldn’t remember their conversation, only a snippet of it.</p>
 <p>"Zhendong, do you have hidden treasure in the golden house? Let her come out to let this brother see his sister-in-law!”</p>
 <p>"It's not convenient as she’s just had a shower!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, look at you. You can’t wait. I won’t disturb your good things."</p>
 <p>The guest left and Lu Zhendong entered another bedroom. He wasn’t embarrassed in the least in front of Cheng Yan as he put on a set of home clothes. He went to grab two glasses of red wine and sat in a chair staring at Cheng Yan while letting out a perverted laugh.</p>
 <p>The doorbell rang. Lu Zhendong got up and said with a frown, "The guest is here!"</p>
 <p>When the man walked in, Cheng Yan's eyes couldn't be bigger. It turned out to be Zhuo Xuan! She buried her head in the pillow and kept sobbing, "Don't look at me! Don't look at me!"</p>
 <p>"So you still know shame? Zhuo Xuan, stand here and watch how I fuck her!" Lu Zhendong laughed.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan's voice was angry. "I see."</p>
 <p>It turned out that the punishment Lu Zhendong had given her was to humiliate her in front of the boy she liked to defeat her pride. Lu Zhendong was always very "creative."</p>
 <p>Lu Zhendong immediately untied his trousers and prepared to get to work. Cheng Yan trembled as she tried to hide herself in the pillow. She didn't want Zhuo Xuan to see her ugly appearance. Lu Zhendong forcibly pulled her over, pressed her hands down with his hands, and began to rape her.</p>
 <p>Cheng Yan was full of tears as she saw Zhuo Xuan who was motionless behind Lu Zhendong. Slowly, he began taking out a knife.</p>
 <p>Lu Zhendong laughed at Cheng Yan. "Even if you shatter your voice screaming, no one-"</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhuo Xuan stabbed into Lu Zhendong's neck and the bed was splattered with blood. Cheng Yan was so scared that she screamed. Lu Zhendong slowly twisted his neck, glanced at Zhuo Xuan in disbelief, and fell down. His corpse lay atop Cheng Yan.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan pushed the man's disgusting body away and helped Cheng Yan up. His eyes brightened. "Sorry, I'm late!"</p>
 <p>"You... Did you kill him?"</p>
 <p>"It's okay. I sounded him out earlier. Nobody knows you’re here. I have a thorough plan but I need your cooperation.”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan said these words with eyes filled with confidence, infecting Cheng Yan. She hugged Zhuo Xuan and felt his strong and powerful shoulders like he was a knight that saved her.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan took out the blood-stained sheets, wiped the floor, and then lifted the body down with Cheng Yan. At that moment, the dog rushed over and bit Zhuo Xuan's leg. Zhuo Xuan screamed in pain. Cheng Yan wondered how it could still act so angry when its master was dead.</p>
 <p>She picked up the dog chain next to it, tied it to the dog ring, and threw it over the handrail of the stairs to hang the dog.</p>
 <p>She had wanted to do this for a long time and felt really happy.</p>
 <p>The dog struggled in the air before it finally died. Cheng Yan's bitterness within broke out and she felt that she had become Zhuo Xuan's accomplice.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan didn't speak as he started to clean up the room in an experienced manner. He wiped his fingerprints, took out a guitar from the study, broke a string, and threw it under the sofa.</p>
 <p>Cheng Yan looked at him puzzled. Zhuo Xuan explained, "I’ve killed another person. It was his life assistant. The police will definitely suspect that the assistant stole this expensive guitar and ran away. We will not be suspected."</p>
 <p>"You are the smartest!" Cheng Yan kissed him.</p>
 <p>"Now we need to get the body out. It's difficult to pass the security. You have to cooperate with me... Do you know how to drive?"</p>
 <p>"I’ve learned before!"</p>
 <p>After confirming that the house had been thoroughly cleaned, the two left. The subsequent development was completely consistent with Chen Shi's speculation.</p>
 <p>"I have no regrets for the death of this scum. He deserved it. It was Zhuo Xuan who saved me!" Cheng Yan ended her confession with this sentence.</p>
 <p>The interrogator asked some questions regarding some minor details. The whole interrogation process lasted for nearly three hours. Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue were both listening outside the whole time. When they heard some parts, Lin Dongxue couldn't help covering her mouth.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi didn't comment until after listening. "Go and listen to the other version."</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan was already growing impatient as he waited in the interrogation room. When Chen Shi came in, he shook his handcuffs and said, "Let me go already!"</p>
 <p>"I'm afraid you can't go. Cheng Yan has already confessed everything."</p>
 <p>"You’re lying to me. You police always like to say these things."</p>
 <p>"This guy won’t cry until he sees his coffin!" Chen Shi asked Lin Dongxue to come in, and she brought a copy of Cheng Yan's confession report in her hand. Of course, it was only part of it. That way, even if he saw it, it wouldn’t affect his confession.</p>
 <p>Seeing the text on the report, Zhuo Xuan couldn't help but tremble. It was unclear whether it was out of fear or hatred.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi snatched the report back from him, sat behind the interrogation table, and said, "Tell me your story!"</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan's eyes hesitated, but he finally opened his mouth. He said that Cheng Yan had feelings for him while she was filming, but he did not expect that the bastard Lu Zhendong would try and separate them. He actually brought Cheng Yan to his home and used a training method to force her into submission.</p>
 <p>During those days, Zhuo Xuan went crazy asking about the whereabouts of Cheng Yan. Finally, the opportunity came. Lu Zhendong was so confident that he asked Zhuo Xuan to watch him rape Cheng Yan to defeat her pride. Zhuo Xuan seized this opportunity to rescue Cheng Yan.</p>
 <p>"If I didn’t do anything, who would preside over this injustice for me? You don't know what the Lu family is like in front of people like us. They cover the sky with one hand with their arrogance and are domineering. I just made the most correct choice," Zhuo Xuan reasoned.</p>
 <p>"You killed another person to avoid suspicion though? Was that the most correct choice?" Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>"You were all being played around, right?" Zhuo Xuan actually smiled proudly.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi shook his head. "Your plan may work in movies, but this is reality. Do you still have things to explain?"</p>
 <p>"Explain what? I said everything I could!"</p>
 <p>"Lying alone shows that what you are trying to cover is worth betting on. You’re about to lose your life. Is there anything more important than your life?" Chen Shi smiled viciously. "Is it her love for you?”</p>
 <p>"We couldn't live together. We were broken up by the bastards, but we can still be lovers in the afterlife!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said in disgust, "Are you confused? Cheng Yan didn’t commit a crime. She is the victim, and you are the murderer! She can continue to live her life, but you will have to stay in prison until your death!”</p>
 <p>Zhuo Xuan's eyes widened. The young man seemed to be immersed in the illusion of star-crossed lovers in death and forgot about the division of criminal responsibility by law.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said slowly, "I want to talk to you. First, how did Cheng Yan fall into his hands?"</p>
 <p>"Then you should ask that bastard!"</p>
 <p>"It's more convenient to ask you. Since you sold her!"</p>
