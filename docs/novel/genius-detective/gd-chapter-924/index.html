 <p>Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue looked at each other in surprise, and then he asked the police from the other branch, "When did that happen?"</p>
 <p>"It was discovered on the morning of the 26th, and the time of death is estimated to be in the small hours of the 26th."</p>
 <p>The police academy’s instructor had been killed on the same night. This was definitely done by the same group of murderers. Chen Shi glanced at the thermal power plant not too far away. “I won’t ask question by question. Please tell us in detail!”</p>
 <p>The policeman from the branch station glanced at the visitors. "Why are you so interested in this case?"</p>
 <p>"In fact, we have also encountered a similar case. I guess the cases will need to be investigated together. You can tell us your findings first, and then I’ll tell you about the situation on our side." Chen Shi took out his badge. "This is my ID."</p>
 <p>The policeman took a look, nodded, and started talking.</p>
 <p>The deceased was quite "famous" in this area. She and her husband were former employees of the thermal power plant. One year, her son ran out of the family member area to play and fell into the river. It was too late by the time he was found.</p>
 <p>After that, she went crazy. Every day she would run to the river to release a small paper boat on the water and talk to herself. That's why the woman acquired a nickname "Crazy Lady". Her husband was embarrassed at first and would drag her home. Later, he stopped caring. After that, her husband even quit his job and moved to another city alone. He was said to have started a new family there.</p>
 <p>Crazy Lady came every day and would squat by the river for several hours at a time. People from the power plant could see her, but she didn't harm anyone and would just laugh whenever she saw someone, so she wasn’t sent to the mental hospital.</p>
 <p>On the morning of the 26th, someone on the bridge found Crazy Lady lying still on the ground with a pool of dark red liquid under her body, so they called the police.</p>
 <p>When the police saw her, they were shocked. Crazy Lady's body was covered with an old coat, the clothes underneath had been stripped off, the chest cavity opened up, and the heart was missing. The murderer seemed to have surgical skills and knew which rib to saw off in order to remove the heart.</p>
 <p>According to the autopsy report, Crazy Lady was first strangled to death, and then picked up by a murderer from behind while the other murderer opened her chest from the front, using a hooked knife and a small hand saw.</p>
 <p>The first thing the police thought of was human organ trafficking, but they felt that something was wrong. A delicate organ like the heart can no longer be transplanted after leaving the human body for a few hours. Moreover, it had been removed in this open-air environment. It would take two hours to get to the nearest big hospital from here, and the transplant viability of a heart that has stopped beating is infinitely close to zero.</p>
 <p>Also, they had gone to several hospitals in Long'an to check. No one has had a heart transplant operation recently. This kind of operation was very cutting-edge. It requires the cooperation of more than ten of the best doctors and millions of dollars of equipment. An unlicensed doctor would be unable to carry it out.</p>
 <p>Crazy Lady also had no enemies. They thought of her husband. The husband had gone to another city without going through formal divorce procedures, and found a woman to start a new family with. Now, their child is already five years old, and they have already been detained on suspicion of bigamy.</p>
 <p>However, he was a thousand miles away at the time, and his current occupation is a courier. He totally lacked the capability to hire murderers, and furthermore, had no need for it.</p>
 <p>All clues petered out, and the police were unable to do anything, so they came to the crime scene to carry out a crime re-enactment.</p>
 <p>These colleagues were all smokers, and by the time they finished talking, there were more than a dozen cigarette butts on the ground. Chen Shi handed over a pack of cigarettes that he carried with him and said, "Let me talk about our situation..."</p>
 <p>After listening, the leader of the other party said, "I see. It’s consistent with our hypothesis. This is a serial murder planned by two psychotic killers."</p>
 <p>"What kind of blood type does Crazy Lady have?"</p>
 <p>"Type O." The other party answered without hesitation.</p>
 <p>"The instructor is Type B. It seems that they weren’t planning organ transplants. The murderers had other motives..."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi called his own people aside and discussed with them, "Should the case be brought over?"</p>
 <p>"It definitely should be!"</p>
 <p>"I think it's good to investigate together. We are short of manpower and it would be great to add fresh troops."</p>
 <p>Everyone had a different opinion. At this time, the other group of people were also&nbsp;discussing it in&nbsp;private. Whoever managed to solve the case would receive the credit for it. However, if they were to investigate solely by themselves, they must also bear the corresponding risks. Either choice had its own pros and cons.</p>
 <p>After the discussion, Chen Shi walked over, and the leader of the other side also walked over. The two started&nbsp;speaking&nbsp;at the same time and the leader smiled. "Captain Chen, you go first..."</p>
 <p>"We’re from the headquarters and have more resources and experience than you. We won’t shirk responsibility, so we’ll take over Crazy Lady’s case."</p>
 <p>"Okay, that’s fine, but I have to send a few people over to investigate together."</p>
 <p>"Brothers, you really have a strong sense of glory!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, it’s also a rare learning opportunity to be able to investigate the case with the headquarters."</p>
 <p>"So be it!"</p>
 <p>The two sides shook hands to establish an alliance.</p>
 <p>Everyone followed them to the branch station to fetch the files of the case. Chen Shi couldn't wait. On the way back, he asked Lin Dongxue to read them out to him. When she was reading a certain passage, Chen Shi stopped her. "When is Crazy Lady’s birthday?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"February 19th, 1973."</p>
 <p>"The instructor was also born on this day. Of course, the instructor's certificate says 1975."</p>
 <p>"This shows that they have a channel through which they found out the instructor's true birth date?"</p>
 <p>"That's right... Let's analyze this. What do you think is the purpose of taking different organs from people born on the same day in the same year?"</p>
 <p>"Well, I don't see any practical significance. The date is only meaningful to the individuals. Is the organ collector conducting some evil ritual...? It sounds so mysterious!"</p>
 <p>"Let’s check it out. People born on the same day, the same month, and the same year. They may all be victims."</p>
 <p>Back at the bureau, the two went straight to the Information Division, and the results of the query were astonishing. There were as many as thousands of people born in Long'an on this day. After removing those who were dead or missing, there were still hundreds of people left.</p>
 <p>After scanning the list of names, Chen Shi was unwilling to accept it. "Expand the scope. To the whole province... No, the whole country."</p>
 <p>"Captain Chen, there might be hundreds of thousands of people." The policeman in charge of the inquiry said.</p>
 <p>"Filter out all those who were or have currently settled in Long'an, and are alive and healthy. There shouldn't be too many!"</p>
 <p>The police officer sighed bitterly and began to work.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Could the channel through which the murderer found out about the instructor's information be the maternity hospital? The birthdates of all babies are recorded and the record in the maternity hospital should be the original version."</p>
 <p>"Where was the instructor born? We have to visit his parents."</p>
 <p>"Just make a phone call."</p>
 <p>When they called to inquire, Sun Lei’s parents said that Sun Lei was born in the Obstetrics and Gynecology ward of the Municipal People’s Hospital. Lin Dongxue said that she would make a trip there to settle this trivial matter. If the Crazy Lady was also born there, they would be able to confirm the source of the murderer's intelligence.</p>
