 <p><strong>Volume 20: Crazed Time Traveller</strong></p>
 <p>On the evening on April 22nd:</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue began liking Gu You who lived next door more and more. Although Chen Shi really cared about her and didn’t treat her as a child like other adults, he was a man after all and was not sensitive enough.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was like an intimate big sister. Tao Yueyue liked to be with her. Lin Dongxue seemed to have a soft halo on her body. Maybe because she was too dazzling, Tao Yueyue wasn’t willing to talk with Lin Dongxue about certain topics.</p>
 <p>Gu You seemed to have a magical power. Tao Yueyue was willing to speak about the most hidden secrets in her heart in front of her. It was always pleasant and rewarding to chat with her.</p>
 <p>On this afternoon when she left school early, Gu You brought creamy strawberries and chatted with Tao Yueyue while eating. Tao Yueyue said that she had recently “fixed up” a schoolgirl who she couldn’t stand, causing the other party to be speechless.</p>
 <p>Looking back, Tao Yueyue's mouth could not help showing a proud smile.</p>
 <p>“Sister Gu, do you think my heart is dark?”</p>
 <p>“Yueyue, do you believe in born-criminals?”</p>
 <p>“Do you want to say that I am one?”</p>
 <p>“In the nineteenth century, based on the psychological analysis of criminals, some people put forward the hypothesis of criminal phrenology<span id="footnote-ref-ee24"><a href="#footnote-ee24">[1]</a></span> and genetics. To this day, some people still believe that the genes of criminals are inherited. Some people are born as criminals. Of course, the environment will shape a person. Such people may become good politicians, sports players, writers, or they may fall into the life of a criminal.”</p>
 <p>“Politicians, writers, and criminals are the same in their hearts?” Although Tao Yueyue didn't understand fully, she felt that the words were very attractive to her. People always want to know more about themselves.</p>
 <p>“In their hearts, there is a kind of invasiveness that challenges order and breaks the rules. It is their environment and education that determine which role they become. Subconsciously, outstanding politicians are the same as fallen criminals.”</p>
 <p>“It's the same in my heart, but I don't want to be a criminal. Uncle Chen will be sad.”</p>
 <p>Gu You smiled and took out a small paper bag. “I want to play a fun game with you. Put these powders in Uncle Chen's water. As long as he drinks it successfully, I will give you a reward!”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“This game is called a crime simulation. Do you want to try to feel like a criminal who utilizes poison? Of course, the game is just a game. It won't really break the law. It's just salt.” Gu You poured a little bit in front of her and licked her palm. “Salt is salty. Since it is ‘poison’, you have to consider how to cover or hide its taste. This way of thinking is the same as those real criminals.”</p>
 <p>“Is there any rule?” Tao Yueyue took the paper bag.</p>
 <p>“You can’t be found out and no outsiders can be told about this. This is a little secret between us.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue looked at the paper bag and said, “Okay, I’ll do it!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue accomplished her first task brilliantly. On the weekend, she went to Gu You's house again. Gu You's house was very tidy and made people feel particularly comfortable.</p>
 <p>Two cups of black tea were placed on the table and Gu You sat elegantly on the sofa and asked, “How do you feel about poisoning for the first time?”</p>
 <p>“It's too simple and I don't feel anything, presumably because I don't hate Uncle Chen!”</p>
 <p>“Everything is gradual. Want to experience a real crime?”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue bit her finger and hesitated. She wasn't sure if the woman had any sinister intentions or not. She knew from a very young age that people don’t have the words “bad guy” plastered on their faces.</p>
 <p>Gu You put a hand on Tao Yueyue's head and said gently, “This is just some of my personal hobbies. Crime simulation is a game that simulates real crime and releases the evil in my heart. I always think that you need to vent your heart reasonably to stay healthy. This game is like installing a pressure valve on your subconscious mind. As a game, it has rules. First, it minimally violates the law. Second, it can never be found out. Third, you can’t mix your personal feelings into it. You don’t have to play, but I think crime simulation is more beneficial than ‘fixing up’ your classmates at school.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Chen said that when a bad guy wants to persuade you, he will omit the disadvantages and only talk about the benefits.”</p>
 <p>“If I want to convince you, I won't tell you its risks. We will sneak into other people's homes and pretend to 'murder', 'kidnap', and 'steal'. However, if we’re found trespassing into a house, we’d still be arrested.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue was hesitating. This game sounded so interesting. She was poked at the acupoint in her heart that wanted to break the order. She couldn't help but tremble.</p>
 <p>“Let me consider it!”</p>
 <p>It was the end of April and May was fast approaching. The school had three days of school holidays. Tao Yueyue finished all her homework on the evening of April 30th.</p>
 <p>On May 1st, Gu You, who ran a psychological clinic, was busier than usual. Tao Yueyue didn't see Gu You until the evening. Although the days worth of consultations made her tired, she still welcomed the visit of this young guest.</p>
 <p>“You figured it out?”</p>
 <p>“Sister Gu, why do you play this kind of game of running into someone's house and risk the danger of breaking the law?”</p>
 <p>“I'm a psychological consultant. To put it plainly, I’m a garbage can for a fee. I listen to the troubles of others every day and sympathize with them. In the long run, I know that my heart will go astray and I need to do something to vent my heart’s dirtiness. I could play S&amp;M and go to bed with men. Unfortunately, I have a cold personality. In essence, I hate socializing with people. My subconscious mind is like a chaos of intricate sewers. It is necessary to clear the dirty water regularly. It will spill out and pollute the beautiful little house in my heart. Our hearts are prideful, and if it wants saltiness, it will make you angry with sugar. It never says what it really wants, only letting you guess. You have to face its desire squarely and give it some substitutes so that it won't ruin everything for you.”</p>
 <p>“What do you want?”</p>
 <p>“I want to sin. I want to kill some people and I want to destroy the order of this world!” Gu You's eyes revealed a fierce light, but then they softened. “But I know that this is not allowed by society, so I play this game as an alternative.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue's heart trembled because the inner desire that Gu You confessed to was also her inner desire. She knew that her heart was like a tainted, dark, and powerful undercurrent.</p>
 <p>“Where do we start?”</p>
 <p>“Crime is a skill. You have to learn first!” Gu You smiled gently. “Follow me.”</p>
 <p>In the bedroom, Gu You took out an entire drawer and placed it on the table. Tao Yueyue marveled at the contents. It was a lock fixed to a wooden board, cut from the middle, and cross-section-sealed by glass. You could clearly see the structure inside. It turned out that locks were very complex.</p>
 <p>Gu You took out two iron hooks. “To be a good criminal, you must first have the ability to enter and exit a room at will. Picking locks is the first step!” With one turn, the lock was opened by her.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue was astounded as Gu You handed her the hooks. “When you reach half of my speed, you’ll pass. I will teach you by hand.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue's heart fluttered and looking at Gu You's smiling face. She seemed to have found a door to a secret place.</p>
