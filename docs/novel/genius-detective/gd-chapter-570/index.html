 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>After the long holiday from October 1</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">, Tao Yueyue discovered changes in her school. Several police cars were parked on the edge of the sports field, and several local police officers entered and exited the office. The dean accompanied them with a smiling face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What happened?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The students asked one after another. It was unclear who had said this, but it was said that Teacher Liu, who taught geography, had lost a packet of Zhonghua cigarettes. Police had to be dispatched for such a small matter? Everyone thought that it was unbelievable. After the morning class, Teacher Liu really ran over and blocked everyone in the classroom from leaving, saying with a serious face, "I know one of you did it! Not bad, even daring to take things out of a teacher’s drawer. If you’re a man, then take responsibility. I advise that person to confess and not get other students involved. Otherwise the matter will become more serious and you’ll be punished!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As he said this, he walked between the seats. His gaze stayed on the faces of a few boys who weren’t too honest, as if they looked like suspects.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Who is it… Stand up... You’ve seen the police cars parked outside. Don't think that you can get away with it..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Mr. Liu mentioned "police", a policeman poked his head through the door of the classroom and said, "Mr. Liu, we have something to ask you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh? Oh, I’ll come immediately!" Teacher Liu's attitude changed 180 degrees. As soon as he left, the class laughed and chattered away. Although they didn't know what happened, it was definitely not regarding the missing cigarettes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Did someone die?" Someone speculated in horror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"Haha, I really hope it was the form teacher." Someone also&nbsp;</span><span>responded</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;randomly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue sat in her seat without saying a word, and composed a text message to Chen Shi, "There are a lot of policemen at school today!" After thinking about it, she deleted it and rewrote, "Uncle Chen, why are there so many police officers at my school?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">It was still inappropriate. She deleted it and changed it to, "Are you going to solve the case today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The first lesson was English. The English teacher was an easy-going old lady who stood on the podium and shouted, “Good morning everyone<span id="footnote-ref-14a0"><a href="#footnote-14a0">[1]</a></span>”. Some boys below asked at the same time, “Ms. Song, did a case happen in school?”, "What are the police investigating?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The English teacher smiled gently and shook her head, "I can say nothing about it!<span id="footnote-ref-9636"><a href="#footnote-9636">[2]</a></span> Regardless of the secret<span id="footnote-ref-8d84"><a href="#footnote-8d84">[3]</a></span>, there will inevitably be a day when it’s disclosed publicly. In the afternoon, your form teacher may tell you. Well, boys and girls<span id="footnote-ref-0186"><a href="#footnote-0186">[4]</a></span>, let us open our textbooks to page 36. Today, we’ve going to learn…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">There were disappointed sighs followed by the sound of people flipping through their textbooks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Chen Shi replied to the text message, "I’m at the bureau. I received the bonus for solving the case today, what do you want to eat tonight?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue hesitated for a long time and said via her phone, "It seems that a case has happened in our school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The English teacher walked around while reading out from the textbook. When she saw Tao Yueyue holding the phone, she turned a blind eye. As the top student in the school, she had many invisible privileges and she wouldn’t be disturbed even if she slept in class.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"The police are there?" Chen Shi replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"They’re here. They’re from the sub-bureau and local police station. I’m curious, so I asked you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"I’ll ask about it..." After a moment, Chen Shi replied, "A female&nbsp;</span><span>teacher from your school</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;surnamed Lin is missing."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue suddenly realized that it was no wonder she hadn’t seen her that day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">She didn’t tell anyone else about it. After class, everyone was still making wild guesses. A boy slipped into the office to eavesdrop on the police’s conversation. When he ran back, he was immensely pleased with himself and acted as though he was a warrior who had come back after taking a huge risk. However, he didn’t hear any substantial content.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At 10:00, several cars drove into the sports field, and the boys at the window whispered, "Are they also policemen?", "Hey, they don't wear police uniforms!", "What do you know? They’re in plain clothes, they are the highest-ranking policemen", "Wow, that policewoman is so pretty, she looks like a star."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Tao Yueyue turned her head and saw a few familiar people. Chen Shi, Lin Dongxue, and Xu Xiaodong. Chen Shi looked a bit frustrated that day. He hadn’t combed his hair and was wearing a dull grey jacket, because he was still handling a case late last night.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Chen Shi looked over, he smiled. He guessed that Tao Yueyue must be looking out at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Today, Chen Shi had persuaded Lin Qiupu to send them out. He had told Lin Qiupu that Zhou Tiannan was at this school. Lin&nbsp;</span><span>Qiupu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;was shocked and blamed him for not saying so earlier. Chen Shi said, "If it was a murder, it’s better to go sooner rather than later. Hurry and take over the case from the sub-bureau!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Do you think that Zhou Tiannan would be so stupid as to kill someone next to his own nest?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Of course he’s not stupid. He’s been quite low-key these years, but in case this case is related to him, we’ll have a chance to investigate him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That’s true. Okay, let me communicate with the sub-bureau!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Chen Shi and the others went directly to the dean for the grade that the missing person taught. The people&nbsp;</span><span>from the sub-bureau</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;and the local police officers were also in the office. When they saw the people from the head bureau arrive, a police team leader said, "I really wouldn’t have thought that Captain Lin would be so eager about this case. He actually transferred it over directly. We actually saved a lot of energy. Please thank Captain Lin and the chief for me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What’s the current situation?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Teacher Lin...", "The situation is..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The police officer spoke at the same time as the dean and then realized his disrespect. The dean said obsequiously, "You talk. You talk... Would you police officers like to drink some tea?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"No need!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"The missing teacher is called Lin Xiaoxiao. She’s the only daughter of Deputy Director Lin of the Education Bureau. She teaches music and is also in charge of a class. She went missing on October 1</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">. She had come to school to pick up some things that day. The security guard saw her at 9:00 AM. Teacher Liu of the same grade also saw her. The two exchanged a few words. She left her mobile phone in the office with an unsent message saying that she was troubled recently, wanted to go out for a walk and asked everyone not to look for her, for she’ll be back soon. &nbsp;It’s been four days since then, and her family couldn’t get in touch with her, so they reported the case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Xu Xiaodong whispered, "It doesn't sound like a big case."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Lin Dongxue replied in a low voice, "Do you believe in words like ‘I’m going out, don’t look for me’?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"Have you watched the surveillance&nbsp;</span><span>footage</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">?" Chen Shi asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"During the holidays, the school wasn’t monitored."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"So, there are only witness statements? Which one is the witness?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">A fat male teacher with a balding head said, "That’s me. That’s me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why were you at school on the holiday?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>"I divorced my spouse last year and the house was given to her. I’ve been living in a rental house near the school. The monthly exam is around the corner and I couldn’t stay idle. I was coming up with exam questions in the office on October 1</span><span>st</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What did you talk to Teacher Lin about the last time you saw her?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It was just an ordinary conversation."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Be more specific."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span>Teacher Liu repeated their conversation. It really was just exchanging casual greetings with each other. Chen Shi said, "She left her mobile phone&nbsp;</span><span>on her office table</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yes, when I left, I was wondering why she had left her phone behind and helped her by putting it into her drawer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Did she seem abnormal that day?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Teacher Liu thought for a long time, "She seemed very normal!"</span></p>
