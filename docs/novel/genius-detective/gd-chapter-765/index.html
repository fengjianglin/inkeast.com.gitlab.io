 <p>Peng Sijue said, "I tested the secretions during the identification. The various components on these fingerprints were identified, and the values are almost the same as those of ordinary people."</p>
 <p>"Almost the same? So there’s a discrepancy?"</p>
 <p>"Aren’t you taking unnecessary pains for an insoluble problem? Everyone has different amounts of perspiration, and the value of secretions will definitely fluctuate... The owner of this fingerprint has a higher amount of perspiration.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Do you suspect that Chen Fengde has been killed and that someone is using his fingerprints to interfere with the investigation?"</p>
 <p>"Yes. If this was the case, the jailbreak problem has also been solved. He didn't escape at all. Someone killed him and took his hand away... I felt like things were strange with the fingerprints at the gym at first." Chen Shi put a chair by the wall and pointed to the back of the chair. "The distance between the side where the fingerprint was left is very close to the wall, but the entire palm was shown, and the fingers were facing outwards. I couldn’t figure it out. What kind of action was this? I was questioning the authenticity of the fingerprints at that time."</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue said, "Since the murderer has the ability to not to leave their own fingerprints, I’m wondering why they bothered to plant fake fingerprints. It’s purely a superfluous action. Besides, these fingerprints are left by a living thing. You don't have to worry about it anymore."</p>
 <p>"Living thing..." Chen Shi seemed to have thought of something, but he couldn't say his conclusion. "Dongxue, let's go to Du Zilin's house again."</p>
 <p>"Huh? We need to go to that kind of place so late at night? The class reunion is tomorrow morning and we all have to keep watch at the scene."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi had to give up his idea. "Okay, we’ll go home!"</p>
 <p>Back home, Gu You went to inquire about the progress of the case again. When she learned that another person had been killed, she let out a sigh. "Chen Fengde may have been used as a hitman."</p>
 <p>The night was very peaceful. With Lin Dongxue's company, Chen Shi no longer had strange dreams and for once, he was able to sleep peacefully.</p>
 <p>The next morning, the two went to a hotel. Lin Qiupu had booked a room. When they got to the room, they saw a lot of radio equipment on the table. The members of the second team were all dressed in plain clothes. Lin Qiupu said, "Today's task is to catch the criminal at the scene, but protecting the safety of the citizens is still the primary priority. When encountering a dilemma, save people first, then arrest people. Because it’s in a hotel, everyone shouldn’t carry guns... In addition, this hotel is a non-smoking hotel. Colleagues that need to smoke need to go to the balcony to solve that first."</p>
 <p>Some police officers stood up one after another and took out their small sticks to the balcony to pass their addiction.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue, who had no such need, put on their radios first and rushed to their place.</p>
 <p>The two stood outside the hall where the class reunion was being held. Those who walked by cast curious eyes at them. "Hotel staff?", "I heard it was the police who came to protect us.", "What is going to happen today?"</p>
 <p>A group of old classmates met and greeted each other both enthusiastically and awkwardly. Lin Dongxue asked, "Have you participated in this kind of class reunion?"</p>
 <p>"Not even once." Chen Shi replied.</p>
 <p>A woman came over with a chair and said, "Officers, you should be tired standing around for so long. Sit for a while!"</p>
 <p>"No. No need, thank you... How did you know we’re the police?" Chen Shi asked.</p>
 <p>"The class representative told us in the group chat! Haii, I didn't expect such a thing to happen, but with your protection today, I don't think anything will happen!"</p>
 <p>"Right, where's the class representative?"</p>
 <p>The woman glanced into the hall. "He’s not here yet, but he should be here soon!"</p>
 <p>The woman was called over. This group of old classmates ordered a big cake and was about to cut it. A group of people elected a representative to cut it. When the cake was cut, someone suddenly screamed.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi and Lin Dongxue rushed in, Chen Shi pushed aside the crowd. "What happened!?"</p>
 <p>They saw something hidden in the cut cake. Someone had already picked it up. It was a girl's school uniform with patches on it and it gave off a foul smell.</p>
 <p>"Isn't this our old school uniform?"</p>
 <p>"It’s so dirty. Who put it in the cake? Can the cake still be eaten?"</p>
 <p>"It might be a surprise by the class representative, but this is too much!"</p>
 <p>"No one invited me?" A voice came from behind them. Everyone turned around and saw a little girl standing on the stage, speaking into the microphone.</p>
 <p>"She... She’s Hanmeng!"</p>
 <p>"Impossible. How could she still be like this after so many years?"</p>
 <p>"Didn’t she go missing long ago?"</p>
 <p>That girl was the girl from the old house who looked Hanmeng. Chen Shi picked up the torn school uniform covered with cream, walked over, threw it on the ground, and said, "Dressing up as a god and playing the devil!<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-765#footnote-a42d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> This is what you prepared!"</p>
 <p>"Hanmeng" jumped off the chair and walked towards the crowd as if she couldn’t see Chen Shi. The group of adults spread out in horror as if they had seen a ghost, forming a vacuum zone around her.</p>
 <p>"Chu Yuhan. April 6th, 1994..." She looked at a woman and spoke indifferently. The other party covered her mouth in surprise.</p>
 <p>Then, her eyes turned to another man. "Jia Lei. April 20th, May 2nd, May 13th, June 2nd&nbsp;1994..."</p>
 <p>She said everyone else’s names and a series of strange dates to everyone present. Lin Dongxue asked puzzledly, "What is she talking about?"</p>
 <p>"Maybe... It was the specific times when these people bullied her." Chen Shi guessed.</p>
 <p>"Liu Xin, May 2nd, May 13th, 1994..."</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the man named Liu Xin slapped "Hanmeng" to the ground. The ladies screamed and backed up. Liu Xin's nostrils fluttered and said, "What do you want to do?! Evil portent, you came here to accuse us? A good class reunion was ruined by you like this! The whole class bullied you. Isn't it because you have a problem?!"</p>
 <p>"Hanmeng" was crawling on the ground with blood on the corners of her mouth, but with a strange and excited smile on her face.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi immediately stepped forward to stop him and said to the man, "What are you doing? Who allowed you to use violence? Do you think you’re still a kid?"</p>
 <p>"You’re a policeman, right?" Liu Xin sneered, and suddenly slapped Chen Shi's face. Chen Shi quickly blocked him.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, this guy turned around and took the cake-cutting knife, and pointed at Chen Shi. "Fuck, I opened an Internet cafe, but you police have never approved the procedures. I lost hundreds of thousands of yuan! I’ll take it out on you!"</p>
 <p>"Have you gone nuts?!" Chen Shi scolded.</p>
 <p>Liu Xin was taken aback for a moment, then looked around. Suddenly, his expression relaxed. "Forget it, I can't beat you. It's time to wake up!"</p>
 <p>As he said this, he swiped his neck directly with the cake knife and fell to the ground, blood spurting out.</p>
 <p>The scene erupted in chaos as people screamed and jumped away wildly. Chen Shi tried to cover the man's wound, but the wound was too deep. His opened eyes kept twitching, and his breath became weaker and weaker.</p>
 <p>"Dongxue, call someone quickly!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue couldn't use the radio at all in this noisy environment. She was about to go out and call for someone when a thin man kissed her face. The man smiled happily. "Haha, I kissed the police flower! It's worth it. It's worth it!"</p>
 <p>Then, he ran to the window and jumped out from the sixteenth floor with a crash...</p>
