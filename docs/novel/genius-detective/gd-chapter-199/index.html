 <p>Lin Dongxue pulled him back and said angrily, “In front of me?!”</p>
 <p>She punched Jiang Yuqi's face and knocked him to the ground. The punch tore a small piece of handsome skin from Jiang’s face and blood bled out from the wound. Lin Dongxue felt her fist ache as the anger in her heart became more vigorous. She was so angry that her breathing pattern was disturbed.</p>
 <p>Jiang Yuqi touched the blood on his face and glared. “I'm going to sue you. You will all lose your rice bowls<span id="footnote-ref-95ac"><a href="#footnote-95ac">[1]</a></span>!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue shouted, “Please stop it with the sympathy cards! Who hasn’t had a miserable childhood? You have to take responsibility if you kill someone no matter who you are!”</p>
 <p>“Dongxue!” Lin Qiupu quickly stopped the impulsive Lin Dongxue for fear that she would make any more radical actions.</p>
 <p>Jiang Yuqi stood up to fight back but was stopped by the other police officers. Eventually, he and Gan Ping were taken away.</p>
 <p>Upon returning to the car, Lin Dongxue's anger finally faded a bit. Lin Qiupu took out a wet wipe to help her clean her wounded fist. Lin Dongxue smiled bitterly. “I may get sued now. After all, it’s not an ordinary person I punched... When I saw that guy trying to push you down, I was furious. “</p>
 <p>“It's okay.” Lin Qiupu patted her shoulder and smiled. “Brother will sort it out for you.”</p>
 <p>After Gan Ping's arrest, she confessed to all the crimes. Lin Qiupu didn’t participate in the interrogation. From the first moment he met her, he had hoped that the girl had nothing to do with the case. However, the more he investigated, the more she proved suspicious. He didn't know how to face her.</p>
 <p>On the day of the case closing, Lin Qiupu went to see Jia Xingyun. The two met at a cafe. Jia Xingyun asked him what he wanted to drink. Lin Qiupu responded, “A glass of water.”</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun still ordered him a cup of Biluochun and said, “Yuqi is going to sue you for violent law enforcement.”</p>
 <p>“I know. The lawyer's letter has been mailed to us.”</p>
 <p>“You didn’t come and ask me to mediate, right?”</p>
 <p>“No, I'm here for something else. I want to figure out every detail of the case. What was the so-called ‘perfect killing plan?’ Since things have come to this, you don’t need to hide it anymore, right?”</p>
 <p>Although the plan wasn’t really related to the case, Lin Qiupu wanted to figure it out.</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun asked in response, “Is there a perfect killing plan in the world?”</p>
 <p>“It doesn't exist. Murders will definitely leave clues behind. There are no unbreakable cases, only that there are police officers who aren’t careful enough.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve been Jiang Yuqi’s friend for many years. I know what happened in his childhood. He always wanted to get revenge on his stepfather, so he clenched his teeth and climbed his way up in society. But the higher his worth, the less free he was. Mr. Chen found us that day. At the time, we were actually discussing this matter. We were discussing a perfect killing plan and finally I thought of it!”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Lin Qiupu leaned forward with interest.</p>
 <p>“The so-called perfect killing plan is just not killing! I told Jiang Yuqi that this old bastard should be entrusted to me and I would make him disappear. My plan was to give him a lot of money and let him leave Long’an. He would hide his identity and Jiang Yuqi would think that I had killed them and disposed of the body. Hahahaha, isn’t it perfect?”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu frowned, feeling like he was being played. “So on the day of the crime, you went to him and gave him a lot of money?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. However, Jiang Yuqi and Gan Ping are truly brother and sister. They have the same spirit and actually executed their 'killing' on the same day! When I learned that the old bastard really died, my first reaction was that Jiang Yuqi did it, so I tried to delay you guys as much as possible, hoping to help him... I didn't expect this to happen, officer! Officer Lin, do you think the old bastard deserved it?”</p>
 <p>“No one can override the law, no matter the reason.”</p>
 <p>Jia Xingyun clapped. “You’re indeed Captain Lin! But in your heart, you think he deserved it too, right?”</p>
 <p>“That doesn't matter. Mr. Jia, you may be summoned at court... Thank you for the tea.”</p>
 <p>Glancing at the untouched Biluochun on the table, Lin Qiupu got up and left.</p>
 <p>The next person to see was Jiang Yuqi. When he came to the door of Jiang Yuqi's house, Lin Qiupu straightened his collar, took a deep breath, and knocked on the door.</p>
 <p>The steward opened the door and gave him a glance before saying that he needed to ask for instructions. After a while, he returned and said, “Mr. Jiang is not here.”</p>
 <p>“I can wait.” Lin Qiupu glanced at the surveillance camera on the door.</p>
 <p>“He’s really not here!”</p>
 <p>“It's okay. I can wait.”</p>
 <p>“Do as you please then!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu stood motionless at the door for a full three hours. The answering machine suddenly rang, and Jiang Yuqi's voice came out. “Don’t play this game with me. I’m definitely going ahead with the lawsuit. You can all go and eat cancer!”</p>
 <p>“Can we talk?”</p>
 <p>“There is nothing to talk about. Hurry up and leave. I need to go out later.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I'll wait for you to go out!”</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Jiang Yuqi said, “You’re so annoying. Come in!”</p>
 <p>The door opened and Lin Qiupu went into the living room. Jiang Yuqi was wearing silk pajamas sitting on the sofa, holding a glass of red wine in his hand. “I’ll only give you five minutes!”</p>
 <p>“Please don't sue Lin Dongxue. If she didn't stop you at the time and you really pushed me down, you wouldn’t be sitting here right now.”</p>
 <p>“Don't talk about ‘ifs’ with me. There are no ‘ifs.’ The truth is that she punched me. Look at my face. Because of this one punch, I lost tens of millions of yuan.”</p>
 <p>“I can compensate part of it properly.”</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha!” Jiang Yuqi laughed. “Compensate? Stinking cop, what compensation do you mean? If it wasn't for my sister's trouble, you wouldn't even have the opportunity to stand here and talk to me!”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Jiang, please be respectful!”</p>
 <p>“Tch! You’re hurting my sister, so your sister can’t live well either! I want to ruin your reputation! The drool of my 10 million fans can drown you all. Wait for yourselves to make the headlines!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could feel Jiang Yuqi's anger. If he could, he didn't want to use that...</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu took out a USB flash drive and threw it over. Jiang Yuqi raised his hand to catch it. He looked puzzled and asked the housekeeper to give him the laptop. After looking at the content, his expression changed. “You’re threatening me?”</p>
 <p>“I didn't threaten you. I just hope you can rescind your lawsuit. As long as you don't sue Lin Dongxue, I can destroy this video taken by the law enforcement recorder.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Yuqi's cheeks twitched for a long time. “You're ruthless!”</p>
 <p>When he got outside, snowflakes floated in the sky and Lin Qiupu's cheeks became hot for a while. He rarely did such things, but he was willing to do it for his sister.</p>
 <p>At this time, Lin Dongxue called him and shouted, “Brother!” He couldn't wait to tell her. “Jiang Yuqi promised not to prosecute you.”</p>
 <p>“Wow! How did you do that?” Lin Dongxue was pleasantly surprised. “Brother, you’re so amazing!”</p>
 <p>“I told you I’d sort it out for you.” Lin Qiupu smiled.</p>
 <p>“By the way, the girl is going to be sent to the detention center tonight. She wanted to see one last person,” Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu glanced at the villa behind him and said, “Okay, I'll let him know.”</p>
 <p>“Let who know? She wants to see you!”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu was a little surprised in the dim night sky with snowflakes falling down silently...</p>
