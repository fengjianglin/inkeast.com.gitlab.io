 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi returned home in a trance. Tao Yueyue had not gone to sleep yet. She was using Premiere on her computer. Chen Shi asked her what she was doing. She said, "Making a small video for a speech. Small environmental protection experts. It’s a boring activity at school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi glanced at her and smiled. "You’re doing so well. Wouldn’t this make the other children’s unpresentable?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They can learn it too!" Tao Yueyue stared at the screen intently, adjusting the sound source.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi took out some alcohol from the cupboard, poured a glass, and drank half of it in one go. The hot alcohol burned his esophagus and his brain immediately had a paralyzing pleasure. If he didn’t drink a glass, he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sometimes, he needed alcohol to slow down his brain, and he unconsciously became infected with the habit of drinking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After sitting silently on the sofa for a while, Chen Shi took out a packet of Yuxi which he didn't want to throw away when he quit smoking. He put one in his mouth, but couldn't find where the lighter was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A flame leaned over. Tao Yueyue knelt on the sofa, holding a lighter in her hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi lit it and inhaled. Tao Yueyue asked, "Uncle Chen, are you in a bad mood today?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Something happened."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Bad things?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It can't be said that it’s bad, but the impact was too great... A bad guy died. It was an old opponent. They suddenly died and I should obviously be happy, but my heart is empty."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's like losing your goal?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, I'm not too sure either."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue took out a cigarette and tried to light it. She exhaled and looked at the cigarette. "I don't know what’s so good about this thing."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahem, don't learn this."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I didn't breathe it in my lungs."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let's put it out together! I shouldn't smoke."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi took out the ashtray from under the table and the two put out the cigarettes together. Then, Chen Shi threw the remaining packet away. He drank the remaining alcohol in one go. "I’m going to bed. You should go to bed early as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncle Chen!" Tao Yueyue reminded him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right, that’s right." Chen Shi gave her a hug and patted her head. "Show me the video when it’s ready!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Be a little happier. I don't want to see you always frowning." Tao Yueyue whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Waking up the next morning, Tao Yueyue had already gone to school. Chen Shi neither drove his taxi service nor went to the bureau. He wandered around the housing community and ate breakfast. The young people all went to work. Only the old people were walking around on the streets. The sun was nice and it felt like the time had slowed down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After eating, he considered where to go next. He suddenly found that he didn't seem to have a hobby. The way he passed the time was to cook and drink alcohol.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Today, there seemed to be a movie with good reviews. He was going to watch it alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this time, Lin Qiupu called and asked, "Why haven’t you come in?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who required me to be there?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't you want to investigate Zhou Tiannan's case?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why should I? Do I like him very much?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re doing this intentionally, right?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't disturb my rest. I won't go anywhere today. I'm giving myself a holiday. Are you envious?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu angrily hung up the phone. Chen Shi opened the ticket-purchasing software and began to buy his movie ticket.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A week later, the case of Zhou Tiannan's falling from the building hadn’t been resolved, and there were no traces at the scene. If they were talking about the motive, there were too many people who hated him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The police searched Zhou Tiannan's residence for the first time, unlocked his computer, and found a large amount of criminal evidence of people he had "helped" in it. As expected, he was holding things over everyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of a sudden, the police were extremely busy and were arresting people every day. Many people, including Yan Ke, were sent to the detention center, waiting for the execution of legal procedures.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was good news, but Chen Shi felt that the real storm was coming soon...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In a basement on October 30</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, a bulky man grabbed a woman by her hair and used his fist to punch her face fiercely. The bridge of the woman's nose was broken, her eyes were full of blood, and her teeth had also fallen out. She cried and begged, "Don't hit..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Say it! Who pushed the boss downstairs?!" the bulky man shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know... I really don't know... The police asked me many times... Let me go. I won't say anything..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pitiful appearance of the woman begging ignited the tyranny in the man's heart. He punched her face a few more times. The woman originally had a good face, but it was now distorted from the beating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a man and a woman watching quietly next to them with indifferent looks. The man wearing goggles said, "Old Three<span id="footnote-ref-3fd8"><a href="#footnote-3fd8">[1]</a></span>, don't just hit the head. If the head is dizzy, the body won’t feel pain.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burly man grabbed the woman, slammed her on the ground, and kept stepping angrily on her spine. As he did so, he shouted, "Why didn't you see?! Why didn't you see?! You didn't see, why?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a crisp click, a pool of feces mixed with blood came from the bottom of the woman, and the man with goggles giggled. "Look at what you did. You broke the spine. I won't clean up the mess afterwards... Fuck, it’s really stinky."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Kill her. It's useless." The female onlooker said casually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The goggles man whistled, took out a needle, and injected it into the woman's neck. She struggled a few times before dying silently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who handles the body? Let’s do rock-paper-scissors." The goggles man suggested. The burly man glared at him, and he narrowed his neck in fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ling Shuang, Xu Fa, the boss is dead. We have to avenge him!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re a wanted criminal. Recently, the limelight has been tight. You should stay low-key. Both Xu Fa and I can move around freely. We’ll investigate this matter slowly."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No need to investigate!" The burly man wrinkled his nose, his face fierce. "Even if we don't know who the murderer is, we all know who should pay the price!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three were silent. Their exchanged looks reached a tacit agreement. They had thought of the same person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Starting today, everyone listens to me. Let those people know how amazing we are!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Old Three, we still need to discuss who should lead... I think."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't call me ‘Old Three’. My name is ‘Zhou Xiao’. From today onwards, I will only use this name. We start with this name and we end with this name!” The burly man yelled, his eyes full of the flames of hatred.</span></p>
