 <p>The two pretended to have come with Wang Haitao and they went to the reception room upstairs. A female staff member brought them three glasses of water. Wang Haitao said, "We won't drink this. Change it to Evian<span id="footnote-ref-9a21"><a href="#footnote-9a21">[1]</a></span>."</p>
 <p>The female staff member said nervously, "Okay, I'll go and buy it now."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "Mr. Wang, you’re just like a rich second generation now!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, Evian is really expensive. I don't usually drink that either... Although my father doesn't expect me to inherit the company, I usually still save money whenever I can. When it comes to doing business, I have really invested successfully recently..."</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi kicked him underneath the table, implying that he shouldn’t talk about the agency. Wang Haitao immediately changed his tune and said, "Stocks."</p>
 <p>After a while, three interviewers in suits came in. They seemed very nervous. They didn't know if they were interviewing or being interviewed. Before they sat down, Wang Haitao asked, "What do you guys do?"</p>
 <p>"I'm the vice president of the company. This is the manager of the marketing department and this is the manager of the human resources department... Mr. Wang, are we qualified to interview you?" The vice president nodded and bowed humbly as he asked.</p>
 <p>"I want to be interviewed by Mr. Zhang."</p>
 <p>"All right, we'll call him then."</p>
 <p>Later, a young president came in, shook Wang Haitao's hand and said, "Sorry, I am late because I was handling some documents... I am wondering what position in my humble company Mr. Wang would like to hold? Does Old Man Lu plan to invest in our company? Haha, just kidding... Are these two your secretaries? Mr. Wang has an eye for talent!"</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao made a gesture of introduction, "These two are my police friends. They have something to ask you."</p>
 <p>President Zhang's face instantly fell. He seemed to realize that this was a “trap.” Chen Shi said, “We are criminal police officers. Rest assured, this matter is not only harmless to you, but also beneficial!”</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, please go ahead."</p>
 <p>"When your father died in 2008, did the will secretly executed by the lawyer mention an illegitimate child and did he receive an inheritance as well?”</p>
 <p>President Zhang was intrigued; he pulled a chair over and sat down. "What? Are the police suspecting him? I also said at the time that my dad was always careful. How would an illegitimate child even come about? But there was that DNA test result. In addition, my dad was mentally confused from his illness at the time, so he added a sum to his will."</p>
 <p>"We suspect that it might have been a scam!"</p>
 <p>Mr. Zhang clapped his hands. At that moment, he didn’t forget to ingratiate himself with Wang Haitao and said, "Mr. Wang, you have brought me good news... Officers, could you please tell me what is going on? Would we be able to recover the tens of millions that the scammer took from us?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked Lin Dongxue, "The money fell into Du Xuemei's pocket and was inherited by her distant nephew. Can they get it back?"</p>
 <p>"It's legally possible, but it’s troublesome."</p>
 <p>Mr. Zhang said, "It doesn't matter actually. In fact, money is a trivial matter. It’s mainly because my dad has worked hard for most of his life. We can’t let the scammer run free with the money... You mentioned Du Xuemei. I have an impression of this woman. She was a shameless little three<span id="footnote-ref-9480"><a href="#footnote-9480">[2]</a></span> who swindled a lot of money out of my father while he was alive. When my father became ill, she suddenly produced an illegitimate child to get a share of the estate. At the time, my mother scolded her and called her a prostitute, and everything was very unpleasant. But she still took away the money. Later I heard that she died in a fire. I think that she had that karma coming since you’ll definitely meet your end if you do so many bad things."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked, almost jokingly, "Was the fire related to the Zhang family?"</p>
 <p>Mr. Zhang was shocked, and then immediately smiled. "Officer, you must be joking. Our family is very strict. Our father taught us to be pure and honest in our actions. We will not do things such as harming others for the sake of money.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought that his reaction seemed genuine. The fire should have nothing to do with them.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi asked, "If you want to recover the money with a lawsuit, we need to know more information about Du Xuemei. I wonder if you could provide some information?"</p>
 <p>"Which aspect?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi showed him his mobile phone with the screenshot from kk, "Do you have any impression of this company?"</p>
 <p>"Shida Software Development Company? Shida..." President Zhang muttered. "I remember now! This company originally belonged to my father. IT was trendy back then. My father had invested a few million in this company. Later, when this shameless woman broke up with him, Shida was given to the woman as a breakup fee. It was in the 2000’s."</p>
 <p>"So, Du Xuemei was the boss of Shida Company?"</p>
 <p>"Please, she doesn't know anything about IT, so she couldn’t run the company well at all. I heard that it was bought over by someone else later.”</p>
 <p>"In fact, we already know who this fake illegitimate child is."</p>
 <p>"Please tell me!"</p>
 <p>"It is inconvenient for us to disclose his identity right now. We have thought of a way to prove that he and your father have no blood relationship. We need your DNA to compare with his DNA. If it is proven that you aren’t brothers, the fraud case can be established."</p>
 <p>"That idea is very good..." President Zhang mumbled to himself, seemingly considering the risks involved. "I'm sorry, I want to confirm your identities first."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue showed him her badge. President Zhang finally believed them and immediately found a cotton swab, took a sample from his mouth and gave it to them along with his contact information.</p>
 <p>After the questioning, Mr. Zhang returned to the topic, "Mr. Wang, do you still intend to apply for a job? If you can come to our company, it would be a great honor!"</p>
 <p>Wang Haitao said, "Well, I want to take some time to consider everything first. Wait for my phone call."</p>
 <p>"Okay, then I'll send you off."</p>
 <p>Mr. Zhang personally sent them off. Wang Haitao went to scan a shared bike, hopped on and said, "Mr. Chen, I have to go grocery shopping. Let’s eat together when we have time!"</p>
 <p>"Thank you so much today."</p>
 <p>"You're welcome. You're welcome."</p>
 <p>Gazing after him, Lin Dongxue said with emotion, "What a down-to-earth second generation rich man who doesn’t put on airs."</p>
 <p>"Having lived in a poverty-stricken environment for over 40 years, he probably can’t change his character! ... You should go and look for Old Peng with the DNA. I’ll go to the Shida Company to see if there is anything I can discover."</p>
 <p>"Give me a ride!"</p>
 <p>After sending Lin Dongxue back to the bureau, Chen Shi went to Shida Company by himself. Although everything had been changed, they still kept the files of former employees. Chen Shi got hold of a name-list and gave Gu You a phone call on his way to the agency.</p>
 <p>kk wasn’t around. Sun Zhen, who was playing a game, said that he had gone out to film an extramarital affair. Chen Shi received a text message from Lin Dongxue while he was waiting. "The DNA isn’t a match. Will you still come over today?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi replied, "Still need to investigate, so I won’t head over. See you tomorrow."</p>
