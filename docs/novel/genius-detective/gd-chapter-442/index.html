 <p>The woman stared at Lin Qiupu and said, "If you let me find her, I will kill that bitch along with him."</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said to the man, "Can you take out your phone and let me check it?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said over on the radio, "Are you crazy? If you really find something, this man's life is over... Why not use my method?"</p>
 <p>"Shut up!"</p>
 <p>Although the man was nervous, he still agreed. He handed over his phone and Lin Qiupu scrolled through it. He saw a picture of dinner outside and showed it to the man. “Where and when was this taken?”</p>
 <p>"A Sichuan hot pot restaurant just outside the community. Honey, we went together. Do you remember?"</p>
 <p>"I don’t!"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu found another photo where they were together and asked the man, "When was this photo taken?"</p>
 <p>"Our wedding anniversary!"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu asked the woman, "Do you remember this?"</p>
 <p>The woman looked confused. "Why don't I remember this picture..."</p>
 <p>"I bought you flowers that day. We went out for dinner and we took this photo under the tower on the way back. Can't you remember?"</p>
 <p>"Shut up!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi outside was surprised. This move actually worked. Lin Qiupu actually had some brains to him.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu also had some reservations in looking at the photos. His finger was always placed at the bottom of the screen. If he saw an unfavorable photo, he would immediately delete it, but fortunately, there was no such photo so far.</p>
 <p>Then, a picture of a woman wearing erotic lingerie appeared. He was very excited. This should be the decisive evidence. He showed it to the woman, "Do you remember this?"</p>
 <p>The woman was shocked. She covered her head with her left hand and her body shook. Suddenly, her voice and tone changed, and said sweetly, "Hubby!"</p>
 <p>The husband was overjoyed. "Wife, quickly put the gun down."</p>
 <p>"Gun, what gun?" She looked down and yelped, "Huh?" She took a few steps back. Lin Qiupu almost rushed over to grab the gun, but he held back.</p>
 <p>He said, "It seems that you’ve realized. In fact, you have dissociative identity disorder. The so-called other person in the affair doesn’t exist. If we have to say there is one, then it would be yourself."</p>
 <p>"Multiple personalities..." The husband said in shock. "I thought my wife just had a bad memory."</p>
 <p>The woman stared at Lin Qiupu with wide eyes. Lin Qiupu said, "Hurry up and put down the gun. Things have passed now. Rest assured, no one will arrest you."</p>
 <p>"I... I cheated with my husband? I cheated with my husband? I cheated with my husband?!" As she said this, the woman's original tone changed back. She suddenly slapped herself and shouted in the original tone, "Bitch, I’ll kill you!"</p>
 <p>The other personality said, "You’re not feminine at all and so unreasonable. Of course your husband doesn't like you anymore."</p>
 <p>The woman yelled, "You still shouldn’t seduce my husband! If you want such a man, marry one yourself. You fish-stealing cat! Slut! Bitch!"</p>
 <p>The other personality cackled. "It’s because you’re so weird that your husband hates you. Your husband said that he likes gentle and pleasant women, so I appeared. He loves me to death. He buys me delicious food and clothes. Every time we make love, it’s with me. You two haven't slept together for months, right?"</p>
 <p>"Huh?! Get out of my body!"</p>
 <p>The police were stunned. What was happening? Was she quarreling with herself?</p>
 <p>The husband tried to mediate and said, "Don't quarrel. You two are both my wives!"</p>
 <p>The woman screamed, "What did you say? I will never allow this bitch to share you with me!"</p>
 <p>As she said that, she raised her gun and aimed it at her husband, but her left hand caught her right and raised the muzzle upwards. It seemed that the two personalities were each controlling part of the body. With a bang, the gun rang and the bullet hit the ceiling.</p>
 <p>The recoil caused the woman to stagger back. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Qiupu rushed over, grabbed the woman's wrist, and forcibly grabbed the gun.</p>
 <p>The other personality screamed, "Ah! Hubby, this man is taking advantage of me! Come and help me!"</p>
 <p>The woman shouted, "Let go! I'm going to kill him and then kill this bitch!"</p>
 <p>The woman opened her mouth to bite Lin Qiupu's arm. Lin Qiupu grabbed the gun and pushed her away. Lin Qiupu ordered, "Come in and control her!"</p>
 <p>When the police rushed in, they saw a weird scene in front of them, where the woman was on the ground with disheveled hair, tumbling around pulling her own hair, biting her own hands, and slapping herself. The two personalities were fighting for control of the body fiercely.</p>
 <p>"Your husband loves me, you should just disappear quickly, yellow-faced wife<span id="footnote-ref-cbb2"><a href="#footnote-cbb2">[1]</a></span>!"</p>
 <p>"I’ll rip your mouth open, bitch. I’ll commit suicide now, so that you won’t survive either!"</p>
 <p>"Try it, crazy woman!"</p>
 <p>"Go to hell!"</p>
 <p>The woman smashed her head into the ground. The pain could be imagined just by hearing the loud bang it caused. Then, she fell to the ground with blood on her forehead. The husband rushed over and picked her up. "Wife, wife, are you okay?"</p>
 <p>The woman opened her eyes. Her eyes were full of charm. She hugged the man's neck. "My husband, I'm so scared. That crazy woman wanted to kill me!"</p>
 <p>"It's okay, it's okay, she's gone. Honey, I’ll protect you!"</p>
 <p>"Hubby is so nice." The woman kissed him.</p>
 <p>The police stood outside the bedroom looking dumbfounded. Lin Qiupu said, "You already knew about this?"</p>
 <p>The man raised his face hesitantly and nodded.</p>
 <p>"Why didn't you say so earlier on?"</p>
 <p>"If I said it, she wouldn't believe it anyway. In fact, that woman is so neurotic that I stopped loving her long ago. Every time I watched TV, I’d tell her that if she was half as good as the wives on TV, it would be nice. One day, she suddenly changed her temperament and seemed to be a completely different person. This was my ideal wife!" The man glanced tenderly at the woman in his arms. “Since then, I have loved her to death. But every once in a while, she would suddenly change back to what she used to be like. She would quarrel with me every time. I consulted a professional before I realized that it was because she had dissociative identity disorder... Of course, I like this version of my wife more. Whenever the woman came out, I would either hide or just try and appease her. I just have no idea where she suddenly pulled out a gun. That’s why this scene today happened."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "Is it exciting to cheat with your own wife?"</p>
 <p>The man smiled in embarrassment. The woman hugged him tightly, and said charmingly, "Women all hope to be the one who’s spoiled in private. Although I have no title, I’m very content."</p>
 <p>"Why don't you have a title? You are my wife! That crazy woman is the one who’s an extra."</p>
 <p>"You’re right. She’s the shameless little three."</p>
 <p>"When I’ve saved enough money, we will find the best psychiatrist to make her disappear."</p>
 <p>"Haha, then you’ll always belong to me."</p>
 <p>The two of them were very kind and loving, causing everyone to feel disgusted. Chen Shi thought that it was the strong expectations of the husband that made the wife split out this personality. The root cause of this incident was planted long ago and it was impossible to remove.</p>
 <p>When leaving the scene, Lin Dongxue sighed deeply. "Do men all have an ideal wife image in their hearts?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "It's not just men. Who doesn't have the ideal standard for their other halves?"</p>
 <p>Everyone happened to turn around at the same time and looked back at the broken window. This family would most likely have even more intense quarrels in the future. Hopefully they would find a solution for themselves as soon as possible!</p>

 <div id="footnote-cbb2">
  <p>1. <span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">D</span>escribes a woman who has been married for a long time. The face color indicates that she has aged with the burden of housework. There are people who’ve said that in ancient China, to cover the aging face, women misuse cosmetics with lead and end up making their face more yellow. So the older you were, the more yellow you got.)</p>
  <p>Husbands use this term to describe their fading love for their wives and wives can use the same phrase to complain about their relationship or the housework they have to do by calling themselves this. <a href="#footnote-ref-cbb2"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
