 <p>When the sun came through the window early in the morning, Chen Shi opened his eyes. "Good morning, wife."</p>
 <p>"Good morning, Captain." Lin Dongxue also smiled and greeted him.</p>
 <p>"I will definitely not eat at home this morning. How about soy milk and deep-fried dough sticks?"</p>
 <p>"I heard from a police officer friend that they once found over a dozen bags of washing powder at a stall selling fried dough sticks, and they had used this as a substitute for baking soda in the fried dough sticks."</p>
 <p>"We won’t be able to eat anything if you care so much about these things. Do you know what the sauce in a burger is made of? Hair! The hair swept out of hair salons."</p>
 <p>"I don't like to eat fast food much anyway."</p>
 <p>"It’s said that grilled fish shops also have tricks like..."</p>
 <p>"Stop, stop! Let’s just go with soy milk and deep-fried dough sticks!"</p>
 <p>After getting dressed, the two hugged each other.</p>
 <p>While Lin Dongxue was brushing her teeth, Chen Shi hugged her from behind again.</p>
 <p>After putting on her jacket, Lin Dongxue threw herself on Chen Shi and hugged him.</p>
 <p>As long as they were alone, they hugged once every fifteen minutes on average. Once they went to work, they would have to endure a full day of separation. Lin Dongxue laughed, "If we continue hugging each other, we’ll be late… Are we considered to be in a normal husband and wife relationship like this?"</p>
 <p>"Of course, we are! True love will make you childish. I think I'm twenty years younger just being with you."</p>
 <p>"Do you feel this way with others?"</p>
 <p>"Only you."</p>
 <p>"Me too." Lin Dongxue smiled from ear to ear.</p>
 <p>The two never asked how many ex-lovers each other had. They neither&nbsp;worried&nbsp;nor cared about it.</p>
 <p>In the vast sea of people, it was great luck for them to have met each other. Everything in the past was a preparation for them to meet each other.</p>
 <p>Sitting in the car, Chen Shi received a call from kk and briefly chatted with him. Chen Shi said, "I don't have time" and hung up. Lin Dongxue asked what was wrong, and he said, "They’ve found information about the swindler."</p>
 <p>"They’re so fast. You could go there during your lunch break. After all, you promised Wang Haitao."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sighed. "I know."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi's thoughts returned to this murder case. Staring ahead, he said, "Is it necessary to investigate the interpersonal relationships of the deceased? We know that it’s probably not a case of personal enmity. The investigation will be a mess. It’s a waste of time and manpower."</p>
 <p>"My brother never thought about those things. He wouldn’t leave out anything from all the things that we should be investigating."</p>
 <p>"Back when I was a consultant, I only focused on the direction my intuition was pointing towards. I didn't have to consider so much. Now I have to consider which tasks to assign to the rookies. Some clues are meaningless but have to be eliminated. For example, the deceased’s first love. It was over ten years ago, and also happened out of town. When we investigate it, we will have to send out two people. Our staff are as nervous as a kid masturbating in their parents’ room. I think the police academy should add another class - cloning technique!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue was amused by the banter and said with a smile, "This case feels as though it will consume a lot of manpower and time. Don't fall prey to wishful thinking. Check all the clues that need to be investigated. Even sand may also have gold hidden in it."</p>
 <p>"I originally thought that when the case was solved, we’d go to a love hotel, but it looks like we’ll need to wait."</p>
 <p>"We can go tonight too!"</p>
 <p>"Tonight?" Chen Shi became excited.</p>
 <p>"On second thought, let’s wait for the weekend. We will be able to stay for a full day so it won't be a waste."</p>
 <p>"Haha, you’re really a person that knows how to live life."</p>
 <p>Therefore, Chen Shi said at the morning case discussion, "The deceased had an ex-girlfriend in&nbsp;Nanheng&nbsp;City. That place is famous for its spicy herbal food, but the humidity is a bit high. You’ll have to travel ten hours by train. Who wants to go on a business trip? Travel expenses will be reimbursed."</p>
 <p>After everyone discussed for a while, Xu Xiaodong raised his hand and asked, "Can I go?"</p>
 <p>"Who else?"</p>
 <p>Another policeman raised his hand, so Chen Shi arranged for them to go on this mission together.</p>
 <p>It was already 10:00AM when the meeting ended, and it took him till noon to deal with some trivial matters. Chen Shi yawned and was about to nap on the sofa when Lin Dongxue ran over to him and said, "Go and look for your little friends."</p>
 <p>It was only then that Chen Shi remembered. "I really wish I could take a nap!"</p>
 <p>He ran to the forensics department and stole a cup of coffee. He drank it while he drove, and they went to the agency.</p>
 <p>Seeing them arrive, kk was very happy. As if his mouth had been smeared with honey, he said, "Sister-in-Law is becoming more and more beautiful. It must be the nourishment of love."</p>
 <p>"Haha, thank you." Lin Dongxue smiled.</p>
 <p>"Let me see the clues that you guys found." Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen said, "This was hard to obtain. You guys will be surprised after you see it."</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen played a video. The screen showed an incense smoke-enshrouded altar. Master Chunhuang was holding a peach wood sword and stepping out the shapes of the constellations. He chanted and suddenly shouted, "Where do you ghosts and demons think you’re escaping to?" He stabbed a piece of yellow paper placed on the table with the peach wood sword and a "bloodstain" appeared on it.</p>
 <p>Someone off-screen gasped in surprise.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue asked, "Isn't this a trick that has been exposed long ago? If something is daubed on the sword, it will turn red when it reacts with another substance."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "This video seems a bit old. Look, Master Chunhuang still looks very young!"</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen said, "I downloaded this from a supernatural forum. He had been secretly recorded while performing a ceremony and the netizens said that he has true powers."</p>
 <p>"What kind of netizens are so naive?"</p>
 <p>"Don't be in a hurry, Brother Chen, there’s still awesome stuff after this!"</p>
 <p>Master Chunhuang took out a stack of charms from the sleeves of his robe and pasted them on the surrounding walls one by one. They saw those charms rising up leisurely against the walls. Master Chunhuang shouted, "Left and Right Guardians quickly appear!"</p>
 <p>Then two figures appeared indistinctly behind him. The videographer was shocked. His hands kept shaking, and the screen suddenly became unstable.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, the table in front shook, and a ball of fire flew out from the incense burner. It seemed to want to escape, but it turned back when it encountered the charms on the walls. Master Chunhuang waved the sword vigorously, seemingly fighting with this fireball. The final slash of the sword cut the fireball into half and sparks flew everywhere.</p>
 <p>After the video finished playing, Chen Shi pondered for a while, and asked, "Were these captured live?"</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen replied, "I’ve watched it frame by frame. If special effects were added later, it wouldn’t be so smooth. This should have been shot live."</p>
 <p>"Then it’s a grand magic show."</p>
 <p>"The scene in which the human figures appeared shocked even me, and the lights also flickered a few times, which was a bit weird." Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>"That was just a projection. There was a lot of smoke in the room. Smoke actually consists of small particles. Projecting a laser on it can produce a three-dimensional image. You guys can rewind and have a look. A small part of the projection had been projected onto his body."</p>
 <p>Sun Zhen rewound the video and found that the figure's arm had indeed fallen onto the body of Master&nbsp;Chunhuang.</p>
 <p>"How do those charms move by themselves on the walls?" Lin Dongxue said, "Magnets?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi also considered it. "Can magnets be strong enough to penetrate through the walls? This principle still needs to be explored, as well as that fireball. However, I believe that this is all fake, and that this Master&nbsp;Chunhuang&nbsp;is a Jianghu swindler."</p>
 <p>kk said, "But his Taoist skills have gotten stronger and stronger over the past two years. President Wang told me that he made the entire table levitate when he was conducting a ceremony in the hotel. What's more amazing is that he can write in mid-air using smoke. I think he has a bit of Taoist power."</p>
 <p>"kk, do you bring your brain with you when you go out?" Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>"I know that the special effects in this video must have been faked, but there’s a saying in Jianghu. ‘Adding fakery to real skills, one can rival the immortals’."</p>
