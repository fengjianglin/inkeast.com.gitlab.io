 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao, who saw the "ghost", hurried back into his house, held his head as he lay on the ground, and muttered, "May the blessings of Heaven’s Officials be upon you and all taboos stay away!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hey, what do you mean by that?!" The aunt rushed in. "You’re cursing me to death early in the morning? Pei, pei<span id="footnote-ref-25db"><a href="#footnote-25db">[1]</a></span>, what bad look... Look at what's going on in your house. It's like a pigsty."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah!" Zhou Xiao looked back and screamed in horror. "The ghost has come in! It has come in! Don't look for me. For every debt there’s a debtor. Find the murderer."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mr. Zhou, did you hear wrong then?" Lin Dongxue walked in and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can you see it too?" Zhou Xiao looked back and forth between Lin Dongxue and the angry aunt's face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What's the matter?" the aunt asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao responded, "A murderer came last night and killed your entire family. I know you think you’re alive, but you’re already dead. You are just repeating what you would normally do. This is called a soul echo."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You bastard!" The aunt frowned and took out a stick of green onion from the basket. She went over and hit him with it. Zhou Xiao squirmed around while holding his head. She slapped the green onion at him while saying, "Who are you cursing?! Your family is the one that’s dead. Your whole family is the one that’s dead!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong tried to stop her, but the aunt was tough and she shoved his arm away. "Don't stop me, I must kill this bastard." Xu Xiaodong staggered and almost fell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao screamed and ran around the room. The aunt’s usual grievances were brought up. She chased and shouted, "Smelly boy, you usually listen to songs in the middle of the night, call takeaways at three in the morning, spit on my air conditioner, and your rubbish is piled up outside every day without taking it to the bin. The little worms born in summer would fly into my house. I’ve tolerated you for a long time!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren't you dead?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Say it again!!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Understood. You’re a zombie. A zombie is biting people!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, what kind of scene is this?!" Chen Shi's voice came from the door as he watched the drama with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing Chen Shi's voice, Lin Dongxue's heart felt hot as though her savior had arrived. He was a driver who often chatted away with uncles and aunts. As expected, he stopped the aunt with a few sweet words. The aunt sat on the bed and panted away. Squatting in the corner, Zhou Xiao’s clothes were torn open, revealing his white shoulders, and a vegetable leaf hung on his face. He looked very pitiful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"...That's the situation." Lin Dongxue relayed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aunt’s anger hadn’t dissipated yet and she pointed at Zhou Xiao angrily. "Your family are the ones who are dead!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Auntie, don't be angry. Zhou Xiao, did you mishear, or was it another resident?" Lin Dongxue said. She deliberately called Zhou Xiao's name to see Chen Shi's reaction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wait, what was his name?!" As expected, Chen Shi had a massive reaction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Zhou Xiao. Xiao as in smile."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This... this, the same name and the same last name?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao asked blankly, "Why do you all act weird when you hear my name? Is there also a celebrity with this name?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s go back to talking about the serious matters!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I didn’t hear wrong. There are six households on this floor. Except for me and her, there’s a young couple next door. On the opposite side to the left, it’s an old man…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aunt corrected, "On the left side, there are two old men living together."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Two... two old men living together?" Chen Shi looked surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao went on to say, "In the middle lives a cat and its slave. The household on the right has a dog. It must not be the case. It’s just her..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Point at me again!" The aunt glared at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I heard it. I really heard your whole family..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Say it again!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Auntie, let him finish talking first." Chen Shi said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I heard the voices yelling so miserably. I was shocked at the time."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re nuts!" said the aunt. "My husband went to work in the morning, and the child went to school. This kid has a problem with his head. You should send him to a mental hospital to have a check."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Auntie, why don't you go back first? Your fish isn’t going to be fresh anymore," Chen Shi suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aunt snorted and left. To vent her anger before she left, she kicked the garbage bag at the door. "Take out the garbage. Are you saving it for the New Year?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Xiao recalled everything he knew. When they left, the three of them went downstairs and each threw two bags of trash out for him. Lin Dongxue said, "I think this witness isn’t reliable. Most people don’t remember things wrong to that extent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Could there be any mystery behind it?" Xu Xiaodong asked. Chen Shi was present and he wanted to hear Chen Shi's opinion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where is the mystery? It must be that he remembered it wrong. But why did he remember it wrong? I think we can look into it a bit deeper. I noticed that he’s a bit neurotic. Could he have a mental illness? We should check his background!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Back at the scene, the corpses had been sent away. Peng Sijue told Chen Shi, "This time, the murderer is very ‘generous’. They left footprints and fingerprints behind."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How big is the footprint?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Size 45."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, it's a big and tall man. They’re at least 190cm..." Chen Shi looked up, as if imagining looking up at the murderer. "Such a person must be very conspicuous in a crowd... By the way, send some subordinates to me to check if that person had entered the housing complex."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was only 7:00 in the morning. The footprints on the stairs may still be found. The forensic police inspected it step by step and found blood and a pair of huge footprints. Finally, the footprints stopped in front of Zhou Xiao's door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi glanced at the next room and asked, "Would you like to go in and investigate? We’re all the way here anyway."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you insist," said the forensic police officer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s check it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Knocking on the door, the aunt looked upset. "What are you doing here again? You really believed the kid's nonsense? It was impossible for anyone to come in last night!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’re investigating just in case."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you that free?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi saw that aunt had fish scales on her hands and said, "Are you preparing fish? I'll help you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aiya, is that true? You’re a policeman but you still do this?" The aunt laughed happily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm good at cooking. Let me do it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aunt let Chen Shi into the kitchen. Chen Shi rolled up his sleeves and started to clean the fish. The aunt said with a smile, "Kid, that's not bad. There aren’t many young people like you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you for the compliment. This grass carp is relatively small and has many bones. It can be fried with flour and the bones will be so crispy that children can eat it."</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, then I'll give it a try."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taking this opportunity, the forensic police carefully inspected the ground and found no footprints outside of the family’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong went in to report. Chen Shi said, "Go to Zhou Xiao's house and check it too!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's not necessary. If the murderer entered, how could he not kill him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Check it out!" Chen Shi insisted. Zhou Xiao's memory was messy, which meant that investigations were needed to fill in the truth. So, they had to confirm all possibilities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xu Xiaodong brought the people away, and the aunt said, "A murderer really came up last night? God, that's terrible!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone adopted the mentality of conducting just a routine check, knocked on the door of Zhou Xiao's house, and checked it. They didn’t find anything. Lin Dongxue said, "Check with the reagents."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although they were reluctant, the forensic police still did as they were told. After all, Lin Dongxue's police rank was relatively high now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they sprayed luminol reagent and saw that there was no response, they began to close up as blue-green fluorescence slowly appeared on the ground. Lin Dongxue said, "Look!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When everyone turned their heads. They saw a pair of bloody footprints on the ground. Size 45.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The murderer had been here!</span></p>
