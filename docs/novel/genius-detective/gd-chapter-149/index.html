 <p><strong>Volume 11: Rich Family Affairs</strong></p>
 <p>Before the winter vacation arrived, the results from the final exam were released. A bunch of students crowded in front of the bulletin board at school and scrambled to check their rankings.</p>
 <p>The school put a line above 420 points on the bulletin board. When Wei Zengmali saw that she had scored 427 points and barely passed the danger zone, she excitedly threw her hands up and cheered. She could now save her little life from the violent bombardment of lectures from all her relatives during the Chinese New Year.</p>
 <p>She continued to search for Tao Yueyue’s name on the list. After looking for a long time, she found Tao Yueyue was ranked in the first row. She ranked twelfth in the grade, and second within her class!</p>
 <p>Wei Zengmali was so shocked that her mouth hung open. She dashed back to the classroom. Tao Yueyue was sitting in her seat reading a novel. Wei Zengmali said very animatedly, “Tao Yueyue, Tao Yueyue! Do you know how you ranked in the test? You’re twelfth in the grade, and second in the class!”</p>
 <p>“It’s not that surprising. The teacher has already told me.”</p>
 <p>“Did you cheat? You only just transferred to our school a few months ago.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue laughed. “The exam is very simple!”</p>
 <p>“Simple? What’s with your brain?! Shout me some food, shout me some food!”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll treat you to some Mala Soup.”</p>
 <p>At this time, a bunch of girls came in. Wei Zengmali recognized the class rep, Li Wei. She was still sitting firmly as the first place of the class.</p>
 <p>Like a moon surrounded by stars, Li Wei walked straight through a group of girls who crowded around her. Li Wei excelled in both looks and academics and was the focus of everyone’s attention no matter where she went, as if she glowed with dazzling light. Wei Zengmali rushed to let her walk past.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue had always wanted to come out on top as soon as she developed consciousness. She looked up from her novel and saw Li Wei stop in front of herself. Li Wei said with a smile, “Tao Yueyue, I really underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to come in second place the first time you took the exam.”</p>
 <p>“It's still not as good as you,” Tao Yueyue responded nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, are you free? I want to invite you to go to a KTV.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue closed her book. “Sorry, I have already promised to go out and eat with ‘Miso.'“</p>
 <p>Seeing the transfer student blatantly refuse the invitation of the class rep, the group of girls that surrounded Li Wei shouted, “You’re not giving her face?”, “Our Li Wei rarely takes the initiative to invite others out.”, “You only got second place. What about it? It’s still a hundred thousand miles away from Li Wei!”</p>
 <p>Li Wei made a gesture and everyone stopped talking at the same time. It was obvious that she had absolute authority in the small group.</p>
 <p>Li Wei crossed her arms and arrogantly said, “People of the same rank stick together. I think you should play more with top students like us. If you play with bad students, you’ll only get more and more stupid the more you acquaint yourself with them.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue stood up. She was shorter than Li Wei and could only talk to her with her face tilted up. Tao Yueyue replied without arrogance nor humility, “Who I have as a friend is my freedom. I hope you won’t bother me regarding that… Miso, let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue took Wei Zengmali's hand and walked away. Wei Zengmali said gratefully, “Tao Yueyue, you are so kind to me. You actually refused Li Wei for me. I am going to fall in love with you!”</p>
 <p>“That girl is very vain. I don't want to have a relationship with her.”</p>
 <p>Wei Zengmali looked back and said with concern, “Li Wei seems to be very angry. Is it really okay to offend her?”</p>
 <p>“I don't care what she thinks as long as she doesn't bother me!”</p>
 <p>Before the New Year, Chen Shi told the task force not to bother him with any cases. The “kind-hearted citizen” planned to spend a comfortable New Year and announced that he would like to take his winter vacation and that he would see them again next year.</p>
 <p>On this day, Chen Shi took Tao Yueyue to the mall to buy New Year’s goods. Tao Yueyue ate a skewer of candied fruit when she suddenly issued a complaint. “The school is a place that doesn’t bring joy.”</p>
 <p>“Are these the words that should be coming out of a student that ranked second in the class?” Chen Shi was choosing the pair of blessings that he would put on the door.</p>
 <p>“People the same age as me are really naïve. They’re obviously children as well, but they want to imitate adults and separate people into ranks. Not everyone likes interpersonal politics and relationships at school, but if they don’t maintain these relationships, they would be bullied.”</p>
 <p>“Is someone bullying you?”</p>
 <p>“Not for the time being.”</p>
 <p>“The school is indeed a seemingly simple place, but it’s actually a complicated one. My principle has always been to keep to myself and avoid trouble.”</p>
 <p>“I hope so as well.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you have some fun over winter vacation? Don’t think about this sort of stuff. What lollies do you want to eat?”</p>
 <p>“I want that milk candy!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chen Shi got a call from Lin Dongxue. He pressed accept and answered, “Miss Lin, didn’t I ask everyone not to contact me about cases?”</p>
 <p>“This case might <em>have</em> to be done by you.”</p>
 <p>“Your brother asked you to call me?”</p>
 <p>“You guessed it!”</p>
 <p>“Haii. I have a child with me! I’ll come right away.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue raised her face and asked, “Can I come with...”</p>
 <p>“Yes, but you need to be obedient.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue saluted him. “I promise!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi went to the city bureau with Tao Yueyue. The police of the city bureau had long been familiar with him. When they saw him, they would nod or greet him. “Brother Chen, you came!”, “Brother Chen, why are you bringing a child here?”</p>
 <p>“A child from a relative. They’re on winter vacation.” Chen Shi explained. “Where’s Dongxue?”</p>
 <p>“The second floor.”</p>
 <p>When they got to the second floor and passed by a conference room, they heard an angry shout from inside. “I don't want you guys to investigate this case. I want Song Lang. I only need Officer Song!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stopped in front of the door and looked inside. He saw an old man raging at people aimlessly. The police officers in the room were very embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu and Lin Dongxue came over from the corridor and Lin Dongxue rushed to Tao Yueyue to say hello. “Are you on winter vacation?!”</p>
 <p>“Sister Lin.” Tao Yueyue happily hugged her.</p>
 <p>“Why did you come with a child?” Lin Qiupu frowned. “It’s already very messy. Don’t add more mess to this.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, she is very obedient... Captain Lin, what is the situation?”</p>
 <p>“You can see with your own eyes. This old man is Lu Qixing, a well-known big-time entrepreneur in Long’an. This morning, a car was found in the suburbs with a male body inside. It was discovered that the deceased is the eldest son of Lu Qixing, Lu Zhendong. Lu Qixing went out of control. He called all the major media outlets to prepare for an advertisement that says that he wants the murderer to pay his blood debt. This is the one…” Lin Qiupu took out his mobile phone. The photo was of a draft advertisement that hadn’t been printed yet. In bloody font, it read, “Kill my child? I’ll make sure you pay with your blood a hundred-fold! Regards, Qixing.”</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu went on to say, “Fortunately, it was stopped in time. Otherwise, it would have been very lively in the city today. The Chief has already made a promise to him to solve the case within seven days, but the old man is forcing Song Lang to investigate the case. Nobody else is up to par in his eyes.”</p>
 <p>“The rich people are truly self-willed... Who is Song Lang?”</p>
 <p>“You don't know Song Lang?” Lin Qiupu showed both surprise and contempt. “He is the most legendary policeman in Long'an City over the past 20 years. He was also my senior once. Your ability can't even compare to one tenth of his.”</p>
 <p>“What a powerful figure. I really want to pay a visit to him when I have time.”</p>
 <p>“You can't meet him.”</p>
 <p>“Then, why are you looking for me? Do you want me to pretend to be Song Lang?”</p>
 <p>“We have to trouble you. The old man is a bit confused and may not remember Song Lang’s appearance. Can you just lie to him? As long as the case is broken, it’ll be fine.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi muttered, “I can’t accept this!”</p>
