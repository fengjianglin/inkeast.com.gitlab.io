 <p><strong>Volume 21: Master Hypnotist</strong></p>
 <p>On May 7th, with the end of the previous case, Peng Sijue finally got half a day’s worth of free time. He went to the Tianchuan Psychological Counseling Clinic run by Gu You to continue treating his depression.</p>
 <p>Although Peng Sijue was also a science major, he found that he had a big misunderstanding regarding psychological counseling in the past. Like most people, he thought that people who receive counseling like this must have psychological issues. That the psychological counselor would only give them two sentences of chicken soup<span id="footnote-ref-6106"><a href="#footnote-6106">[1]</a></span>, which would only produce a placebo effect.</p>
 <p>Dr. Ji Changxin, who was his counselor, was experienced and knowledgeable. He used cognitive therapy to help Peng Sijue to relieve depression and made him realize that work and life are equally important.</p>
 <p>Every time Peng Sijue came here, he felt physically and mentally relaxed, and the consultations with Dr. Ji were particularly pleasant.</p>
 <p>Today should be his last consultation.</p>
 <p>It may have been because he came too early, but there was no one in the reception room. Peng Sijue sat down and waited for a while. It was quiet, except for the occasional ‘gulu’ sound from the water cooler from time to time. He wasn’t sure how long he sat there, but Peng Sijue suddenly heard some suspicious sounds. They seemed to come from consultation room number 2.</p>
 <p>Due to his professional sensitivity, Peng Sijue walked over and quietly pushed open the door of the room. The scene inside made him widen his eyes.</p>
 <p>He saw Gu You lying on a lounger with her eyes closed as if she was asleep and having a nightmare. Her two legs encased in black tights kept twisting, and her breasts kept moving up and down with each pant.</p>
 <p>And that “highly respected” counselor Dr. Ji was slowly unbuttoning her shirt. Peng Sijue felt instantly disgusted. The image that he had of the counselor collapsed suddenly. He pushed open the door, “Dr. Ji, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin was startled and said incoherently, “Peng... Mr. Peng... Why have you come...”</p>
 <p>Seeing a pocket watch and a small speaker for music, Peng Sijue suddenly understood and frowned. “You hypnotized her and then did this kind of lowly act. Yet, you’re a psychologist.”</p>
 <p>“Things are not like what you think. Boss Gu said she has been feeling a little bit stressed lately and wanted to receive my hypnosis therapy. I just... I was just helping her relax a bit! If you don’t believe it, you can ask her when she wakes up. In fact, I’ll wake her up now.”</p>
 <p>“No need!” Gu You, who was in a hypnotized state, opened her eyes suddenly and sat up sharply. This scene made Ji Changxin’s heart freeze.</p>
 <p>“You... You haven't been hypnotized?”</p>
 <p>“Ji Changxin, you're fired.”</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about... I just thought that your buttons were too tight and wanted to loosen things up for you... Do you want to say that this is sexual harassment?”</p>
 <p>Gu You sneered, got up from the lounger, took out a hidden miniature camera from the flowerpot and shook it in her hand, “In the first twenty minutes, you did more than this though?”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin seemed as if he had just been slapped. His face turned pale instantly and his mouth hung open, speechless.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue was also stunned. He didn’t expect that this incident would progress like this. No one was in the consulting room at noon. It turned out that it had all been planned by Gu You.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin stammered for a long time and finally came up with an extremely ridiculous reason. “Boss, this... This is something you can’t blame me for. If you want to blame something, it’s that your figure is too sexy. I’m also a man and couldn’t control myself for a while.”</p>
 <p>Gu You shook her head with a sneer, and her eyes were full of contempt, “As a psychiatrist, it's sad to be driven by male hormones to do such despicable things! It doesn't matter, even if you say that this is a trap. If I didn’t receive complaints from clients one after another, saying that during the process of hypnosis they felt as if someone was touching them, I wouldn’t have intentionally set up this trap! Ji Changxin, you are not worthy of being a psychologist. From now on, you are fired!”</p>
 <p>“Everyone makes mistakes! Give me another chance!” Ji Changxin wailed. “And you are in violation of the labor law. I will retire in a few years. If you fire me, my pension...”</p>
 <p>“I'm not only going to fire you!” Gu You said softly but aggressively, suppressing her anger, “I will also talk to those in our field in Long’an City. From now on, no clinic will hire you! You said that I violated the labor law. However, you violated professional ethics first. The biggest taboo for a psychologist is to misuse one’s professional privileges to satisfy one's selfish desires. This is sexual harassment and you have violated the law. You can’t justify it anywhere... Officer, would I be able to ask you to testify if this goes to court?”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue nodded silently.</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin knew that the situation was irreparable and gave Peng Sijue a miserable glance. “Mr. Peng, I'm so sorry. I can't continue your treatment. If you want to continue consultations with me, you can contact me...”</p>
 <p>“No need,” Peng Sijue said mildly and indifferently, “I don't want to be counseled by people like you, thank you.”</p>
 <p>Ji Changxin pursed his lips and returned to his office to pack things up. When he was leaving, he angrily kicked a pot of plants over. Gu You said towards the door, “I will deduct that from your severance pay.”</p>
 <p>“Go to death, ho! Pretending to be pure!” Ji Changxin shouted, before slamming the door shut.</p>
 <p>Gu You smiled at Peng Sijue, “You will never know some people’s true nature until the very end.”</p>
 <p>“You drove everyone else away today to set up this trap? Miss Gu's calculating mind is very deep.”</p>
 <p>“People who love their profession all hate the scum in their profession very much. Doesn’t Mr. Peng feel the same?” Gu You brought a cup of tea to Peng Sijue, and Peng Sijue took the tea cup. He was too embarrassed to keep standing, so he sat down on the sofa.</p>
 <p>“I feel the same way. I may be even more angry than you when I encounter scum in the police force.”</p>
 <p>“By the way, in consideration of your mental loss, I will refund half of the pre-paid treatment fee back to Mr. Chen who had paid on your behalf.” Gu You actually sat down right next to Peng Sijue.</p>
 <p>The woman's closeness made Peng Sijue a little uncomfortable. He moved away a little and said, “As you wish!”</p>
 <p>“Is your treatment over?”</p>
 <p>“I'm alright.”</p>
 <p>“A person who fails to manage his own desires will have problems. How does Mr. Peng handle this matter?”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue thought the topic seemed a bit dangerous, raised an eyebrow and said, “I don’t think we’re that familiar with each other, right?”</p>
 <p>“You are a very rational person. You always have your own unique views on things. You have a yardstick in your heart to limit yourself. You are also a perfectionist. You are accustomed to giving silently and rarely care about your own gains and losses. You have a very important person in your heart, but you do not relate to him on a sexual level. To you, he is like a spiritual opposite.”</p>
 <p>Exposed at a glance, Peng Sijue was a little uncomfortable. He said, “I should go.”</p>
 <p>“Mr. Peng, I want to make love with you.”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue, who was about to get up, turned back in surprise, and was met with Gu You's slight smile. He suspected that he had heard it wrong.</p>
