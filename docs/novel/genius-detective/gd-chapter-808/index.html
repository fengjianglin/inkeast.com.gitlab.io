 <p>He Jingjing sighed, and put these paintings back into the hidden compartment one by one, constantly confirming whether there were any clues left behind.</p>
 <p>He Jun suddenly picked her up, spun her around, and said happily, "We succeeded, haha, we have succeeded."</p>
 <p>"How many times do you have to celebrate? You’re so excited!" He Jingjing feigned anger coquettishly.</p>
 <p>"I still want to 'celebrate'. Let's go to the bedroom!" He Jun raised his eyebrows suggestively.</p>
 <p>"You’re really frivolous." He Jingjing kissed his mouth. "Let’s go to the stop and have a look."</p>
 <p>The two arrived at the shop front and He Jingjing glanced outside. She suddenly said, "Strange. Why are all the other pawn shops closed? Could something have happened?"</p>
 <p>"You’re thinking too much. It's going to rain soon, so they closed early. Let's close too. No customers will come at this time."</p>
 <p>He Jingjing nodded in agreement, and the two closed the roller shutter door. He Jingjing finally took a look at Shangma Street. The darkness and silence outside was terrifying. She knew that she was experiencing a guilty conscience at that moment. She must calm down and calm down even more, drawing upon her usual position as a successful career woman. She must not reveal even the tiniest flaw.</p>
 <p>The landline in the store suddenly rang, frightening He Jingjing so much that her heart pounded. He Jun picked it up and said roughly, "Who is it? What nonsense are you talking about?"</p>
 <p>"Let me take it!" He Jingjing asked for the phone receiver.</p>
 <p>A sinister man’s voice came from the phone, sounding as if he was speaking through a cloth-covered mouth, "I really admire you guys. You actually dared to plot against Master Lie. You must be scared to death by now?"</p>
 <p>He Jingjing answered indifferently, "I don't know what you’re talking about!"</p>
 <p>"You know full well what I’m talking about. There are some things you can’t take. If you insist on taking it, your fingers will rot, then the whole arm will rot, and finally your whole person will rot, because you don't have that karmic reward. That stuff is wealth in the hands of Master Lie, and disaster in your hands!"</p>
 <p>"You’re crazy!" He Jingjing hung up the phone.</p>
 <p>"He’s just bluffing..." He Jingjing had just finished speaking to He Jun when the unlocked roller shutter door was suddenly pulled up from outside. Several angry men in black suits walked in and He Jun shouted, "What are you doing?!"</p>
 <p>He Jun stretched out his hand to stop him, and the man leading the group, who had features like someone from an impressionist oil painting, pointed at him. "Just try and touch me. Be careful or your fingers will break!"</p>
 <p>He Jun withdrew his hand in fright.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" gestured, and his subordinates began to rummage through things roughly, throwing items on the shelves out. He Jingjing frowned. Her face was like frost.</p>
 <p>It was as though they were in their own house. They went into their room and started searching, kicking open the cabinet door roughly with their feet and lifting the mattress. The "Impressionist" even took out the leftover sausage from the refrigerator and ate it. He walked over to a large vase, pushed it and it smashed into pieces. Then he stared sharply at He Jingjing.</p>
 <p>"Boss, we didn't find anything!" His subordinate reported.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" pointed at He Jingjing with the sausage in his fingers. "Why don't you feel heartbroken? We smashed your things, so why don't you look distressed? I understand now. These mean nothing to you. You must have won the lottery recently, or acquired some ill-gotten gains!"</p>
 <p>He Jingjing felt as though she had the tip of a knife pointed at her neck. She said in the calmest tone she could muster, "You’re Master&nbsp;Lie’s&nbsp;men. Normally, Master Lie takes such good care of us, how would we dare to say no?!"</p>
 <p>"You know that Master Lie has taken care of you, so you repay him like this?" The "Impressionist" sneered.</p>
 <p>He Jingjing knew that the other party was bluffing. Spreading fear was their forte. In fact, they didn't know anything, because if they did, they wouldn’t use this method of confrontation.</p>
 <p>"I don’t know what you're talking about!"</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" walked up to He Jingjing, stared at her face, and then actually stretched out his tongue to lick a drop of sweat off her face. He smacked his lips as though he was tasting wine.</p>
 <p>"What are you doing?!" He Jun angrily said.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" walked up to He Jun again, staring at him, and He Jun stepped back in fear. Suddenly, the "Impressionist" brought his mouth up to his and roughly opened his mouth with his tongue. After a violent French kiss, He Jun retreated, spitting.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" savored the taste and squinted. "Your tongue is very bitter. You’re nervous. Why?!"</p>
 <p>"I RNMLGB!"<a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/genius-detective/gd-chapter-808#footnote-4e01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> He Jun scolded, feeling greatly insulted.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" raised his eyebrows and said as if he was deaf, "You wanted to fuck my what?"</p>
 <p>He Jun didn’t dare to speak any more. The "Impressionist" added drama. "If you want to do that with my mom, then you’re my dad. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! The person I hate most is my Daddy. You’re actually my Daddy?!"</p>
 <p>He Jun showed an extremely embarrassed expression. He didn't know how to deal with this situation. What kind of lunacy was this? He Jingjing said, "Big Brother, please calm down..."</p>
 <p>"Shut up, woman!" The roar from the "Impressionist" almost shattered the glass. "Come hit me, Daddy. Hit me like you did when I was a kid, please!" He put his face right in front of He Jun, slapping it hard.</p>
 <p>"Big Brother, I made a mistake, okay?"</p>
 <p>"Daddy hit me quick! Hit me!" The "Impressionist" glared at him so hard that his eyeballs looked like they were going to fall out.</p>
 <p>He Jun didn’t know what he should do. He gritted his teeth, stomped his feet, and slapped his opponent's face. The "Impressionist" staggered from the slap. He spat out the blood in his mouth and said, "Harder, Daddy!"</p>
 <p>This time, He Jun was really infuriated. He kicked him in his stomach. The "Impressionist" fell onto the floor, got up and laughed. "Have you not had dinner? Use more force. Within three strikes, if you don't kill me, hehe, I will kill you!"</p>
 <p>"You said it yourself!" He Jun grabbed a broken shard off the floor, pointed it at the neck of the "Impressionist" and tried to thrust it at him. He Jingjing was so frightened that her heart stopped beating.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" caught He Jun's wrist steadily, stared at him and said, "You’re really going to kill me!"</p>
 <p>Then he hit He Jun's face with his head. He Jun backed up a few steps, blood spurting from his nostrils. He yelled out a curse word and punched him back. The "Impressionist" brought his arm over his shoulder and turned, flipping He Jun over his shoulder onto the floor. He Jun fell onto the floor and rolled around.</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" laughed weirdly like a hyena which had finished off its prey. He circled He Jun with his hands in his pockets and then kicked over a chair, putting He Jun's leg on it.</p>
 <p>He Jun, who had been in the underworld, knew what he was going to do. He was planning to break his knee with a stomp of his foot. He Jun desperately begged for mercy. "Big Brother, I was wrong. Please stop!"</p>
 <p>"Aren't you my father? If you’re my father, you have to take responsibility. If you can't take responsibility, then what kind of father are you?"</p>
 <p>"It was my fault. It was my fault. Please don't do it!"</p>
 <p>The "Impressionist" looked as though he lost his fun. "I'm bored!" Then he raised his right leg, preparing to stomp.</p>
 <p>At this time, a voice exclaimed, "Stop!"</p>
 <p>1. You can read this as a bunch of stringed-together curse words that means “fuck your mum.”&nbsp;</p>
