 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi put the piece of paper back to block the camera and said, "Who is your 'master'? Did they make you call them master?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xin Bai covered his ears and shook his head desperately, like a tortoise retracting into their shell. "I can't say, I can't say! Master will punish me. Sorry master, I was wrong. I’ll write the manuscript, I’ll write it well!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi retreated in order to advance. "Do the injuries on your body hurt?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xin Bai nodded with tears falling down his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'll take you for a checkup and treatment, okay?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Afterwards, Chen Shi called Lin Qiupu and Peng Sijue. Although Lin Qiupu didn't say anything, his expression showed disgust toward this "actor". As a serious and upright person, he despised these dishonest suspects.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xin Bai was taken to Peng Sijue who took off his clothes for examination. Several people saw that there were many bloodstains and bruises on his body. New wounds covered the old ones. There was almost no piece of good skin. There were cigarette burn marks on his arms. Peng Sijue also found that there were a lot of whip marks on his back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Take off your pants," Peng Sijue ordered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Take off my pants?" Xin Bai glanced at Lin Dongxue who was present.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How about I take my leave?" Lin Dongxue said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aiya, hehehe, I'm a little excited to take off my pants in front of so many people!" Xin Bai blushed and started to take off his pants. He readily tried to take off his underwear, but was stopped by Chen Shi. "Hey, no one wants to look at that."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This inspection isn’t thorough. Forensic medical examinations have to be done while stripped naked." Xin Bai complained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They saw a lot of injuries on his legs. It seemed to be mainly from scratching and whipping. Xin Bai touched his private parts and said shyly, "There are also injuries here..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Everyone, get out first. I'll check." Peng Sijue instructed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, he called them back. At this time, Xin Bai was already wearing clothes, sitting on the dissecting table like a child, dangling his legs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Peng Sijue said, "His urethra is swollen. There’s a scar from an electric shock on his penis. He says that he was tortured by a person who inserted something into his urethra before electrocuting him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really... It’s really psychotic." Lin Dongxue couldn't imagine what had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are these injuries caused by others? Or did you do them yourself?" Lin Qiupu questioned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It wasn’t me! It wasn’t me!" Xin Bai said loudly as he was lying on the dissection table, before suddenly clutching his stomach and rolling around. "My stomach hurts. There is a magnet in my intestines. It hurts!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Peng Sijue was about to step forward to check, but Xin Bai struggled so hard that he couldn't get close at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu frowned. "Acting again? You put up an act as soon as we ask you about the key matters!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I think it's still better to do an X-ray!" Chen Shi suggested, "This kind of passage appeared in his novels. There was a psycho who fed a magnet to the deceased. That passage was written quite realistically. Could it be his personal experience?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What would happen if you were fed magnets? Are magnets poisonous?" Lin Dongxue asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"A small piece of magnet won’t do any harm, but if there are many, they will attract each other in the intestines. This isn’t fatal, but it will cause necrosis and inflammation of the intestines over time." Peng Sijue said. "Take him to get an X-ray!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, in a supermarket in Long'an, a TV hanging from the ceiling was broadcasting an advertisement. "What kind of tea is it? Intestinal cleaning tea<span id="footnote-ref-e9fb"><a href="#footnote-e9fb">[1]</a></span>; What does it clean? It cleans the intestines. What brand is it? The Chang Qing brand! Clean the intestines and bowels. Remember that it’s Chang Qing brand, Qing Chang Tea. We all like to use the Chang Qing Brand Qing Chang Tea. After using Chang Qing brand Qing Chang Tea, your intestines will be relieved and you won’t have constipation. So use Chang Qing brand Qing Chang Tea!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Every time he heard this advertisement, his scalp numbed and a blood vessel bulged on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This damn advertisement was broadcasted every three minutes. He worked in the supermarket for ten hours a day, which meant listening to it a hundred times. One hundred times!!!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Brother, what's the barcode for the broccoli?" His colleague Little Wang asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"XD9873!" He answered impatiently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He continued to help the customers weigh vegetables and bag items. A lot of old men and women crowded in front of the weighing area without consideration for queuing at all. They all exuded the stink that came with old age.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An old man threw a large handful of Chinese celery onto the counter and arrogantly chatted away with the old lady next to him. The dirt on the celery flicked on his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He picked up the bag and weighed it mechanically. The old man took it away as if he never saw him. After standing here for ten hours, it was a miracle to even hear ten ‘thank you’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Resentment continued to accumulate in the body, and it was about to burst out. It was about to explode!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What kind of tea is it? Intestinal cleaning tea; What does it clean? It cleans the intestines; What brand is it? The Chang Qing brand! Clean the intestines and bowels. Remember that it’s Chang Qing brand, Qing Chang Tea. We all like to use the Chang Qing Brand Qing Chang Tea. After using Chang Qing brand Qing Chang Tea, your intestines will be relieved and you won’t have constipation. So use Chang Qing brand Qing Chang Tea!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was here again. He felt his blood pressure rising and he was about to break.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Brother, what's the barcode for broccoli?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"XD9873!" He replied, his tone getting even more impatient.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What kind of tea is it? Intestinal cleaning tea…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, cursing the person who filmed and broadcasted the advertisement eighteen times. He restrained the force that was about to burst out in his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Brother!" Little Wang smiled like an idiot. "What's the barcode for broccoli?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Life was torture that repeated every day. His nostrils were flaring and certain energy in his body had risen to a critical value.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He picked up a white turnip and walked over to Little Wang. Little Wang had a dazed smile that was laced with flattery on his face. Suddenly, the white turnip hit Little Wang's face, and the turnip broke into two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He held up the electronic scale and swung it at Little Wang's head, shouting, "XD9873! XD9873! XD9873! Pig’s brain, remember it. Don’t ask again. Don’t ask again!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Xiao Wang's ugly head slowly flattened, and a bright red liquid appeared like a squashed water radish. The smell of blood filled the air. The old men and women fled, tripping and trampling over each other as they screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He brushed his hair that was dampened with sweat, raised his hands, and shouted, "Are you guys alive? Huh?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What kind of tea is it? Intestinal cleaning tea…"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He threw the blood-stained electronic scale at the TV and shouted, "I’ll fuck your mum!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Under the effect of adrenaline, his nostrils expanded to the limit, as he greedily inhaled the air soaked in blood. It smelled so sweet. This was what being alive was like. This was what it meant to be alive...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Brother, brother, what's the barcode for the broccoli?" Little Wang's voice awakened him from his fantasy. It turned out that he was in a daze with a bag of unweighted potatoes in his hands. The old man in front of him urged, "Hurry up. Why are you in a daze?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He suppressed his fists that wanted to hit someone, took a deep breath, and continued to act like the honest side of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After work came to an end, he went to the manager’s office and said that he was feeling ill and wanted to ask for leave. The manager replied, "One day of leave will have three days’ worth of pay deducted. You should think about it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’m really sick today and I have a fever." He said passively. The image of himself reflected in the manager's glasses was a disgustingly honest image, just like a harmless sheep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go to the HR office and tell them yourself. Bring a leave form over and let me sign it." The manager waved his hand to drive him away and continued to play Hearthstone on his phone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leaving this hell-like place, his steps became livelier until he accidentally bumped into a big man. He quickly stepped back and apologized. The big man dusted his clothes down, widened his eyes, and shouted fiercely, "Don’t you have eyes?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm sorry, I’m sorry. I'm in a hurry." he replied, becoming a yesman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After finally escaping from this world,<span id="footnote-ref-60c4"><a href="#footnote-60c4">[2]</a></span> and returning to his dark and warm nest, he muttered excitedly, "My baby. My writer baby, are you okay? Daddy misses you so much!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was only one computer in the narrow and dark room. He opened a surveillance program, stared at it for a few seconds, and suddenly widened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He immediately picked up the phone, but put it down and searched the Internet for the keywords "Xin Bai" instead.</span></p>
