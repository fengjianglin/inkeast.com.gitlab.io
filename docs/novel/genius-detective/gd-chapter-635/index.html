 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi asked, "I heard that you were friends with Geng Zhangle. Did you know each other when you were young?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Director Wei laughed, “Playing together when we were young is nothing worth talking about. We were just a bunch of young people messing around on the streets. Oh yes, we also fought with other groups and grabbed their territory. Geng Zhangle was our boss. Could his opponents from back then have taken revenge against him?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who were they?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Director Wei listed a few names and Chen Shi noted them down one by one. Then he asked, "I heard from the factory employees that you pay Geng Zhangle a very high salary, and you were basically supporting an idler."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We were good friends! Not a single place was willing to take him in after he was released from prison. How could I not help him out as an old buddy? Besides, he was actually very responsible when guarding the door. There has been basically no theft occurring in the factory over these years."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he said this, Director Wei concealed a trace of panic with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two chatted for a while longer and he asked about Director Wei’s alibi before they said goodbye. After preliminary probing, Chen Shi felt that Director Wei could be listed as a suspect. He vaguely felt that there was some secret between Director Wei and the deceased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue received a text message from the Information Department. It was a list of people Geng Zhangle had contacted before he died. It included Li Zhen, Director Wei, his daughter, and his daughter’s boyfriend. Chen Shi said, "Let’s focus on investigating Director Wei first. Let's go to Geng Zhangle's house and have a look."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yesterday, a colleague found out from the bank that Geng Zhangle's ICBC card had recently received 400,000 yuan, but the money was quickly transferred away."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Was it before or after his death?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Noon on the day of the incident."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Can you find out where it went?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Still investigating."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Geng Zhangle’s family had already set up a mourning hall. His daughter, Geng Qing, and her boyfriend were wearing mourning clothes and burning joss paper in front of Geng Zhangle’s altar. Geng Zhangle’s old gang of buddies were playing mahjong in the living room and there was constant laughter coming from them, which seemed a bit out of place for the occasion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi said to Geng Qing, "My condolences. We just came to take a look."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you. When can my father's body be brought back? The funeral home has been contacted, and I’m going to cremate him in the near future." Geng Qing's eyes were swollen, as if she had cried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We will do it as soon as possible." Chen Shi glanced at the living room. "Who are those people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They’re all my dad’s friends. Look at my dad’s character. Only these few people came after his death, and there are no relatives! I’ve gotten over it these last two days. Sudden death might not have been a bad thing for him. He’d only suffer with health like that in old age. Leaving so suddenly would actually spare him a lot of trouble."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncle Geng met with sudden death? Was it because of rheumatism?" the boyfriend asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"As for the cause of death, the police haven’t come to a conclusion yet." Chen Shi asked, "Your last name?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My name is Wang Mengqi. This is my business card. If you need anything, you can contact me at any time." Wang Mengqi handed over a business card.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi glanced at him. He was the sales manager of a children's food company. He smiled and said, "A manager. How young and promising!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s too much praise. I’m just working for others."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Geng Qing, can you step aside and have a talk with us?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three moved to the bedroom, and Chen Shi asked, "We found 400,000 yuan in your father’s card. The money was transferred away on the day of his death. What happened to this money?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know!" Geng Qing was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Any ideas?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Geng Qing thought for a while. "Have you checked all those people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We checked, but there’s nothing suspicious. Oh yes, how was his relationship with Director Wei?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Emm, he often told others how strong his relationship with Director Wei was, but on a few occasions when he was drinking at home, he scolded Wei for taking revenge after owing favors or something... Ah, right, my dad has a QQ account. Do you want to have a look?."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Geng Zhangle had applied for a QQ account using his daughter’s computer. Geng Qing asked them to try Geng Zhangle’s mobile phone number, and they managed to log in. All of his friends were women. His screen name was "The Last Big Brother of Jianghu" and his profile picture was a selfie wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi thought that this uncle was quite trendy, but before the spirit of the deceased, this kind of remark was disrespectful, so he didn’t say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This QQ account was mainly used by Geng Zhangle to play games. There wasn’t much in his chat history. There were only some flirtatious chat records with some middle-aged women. Chen Shi asked, “There are rumors that your father and Li Zhen’s wife were in a relationship. Was this true?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Geng Qing admitted reluctantly, "My dad was indeed a bit immature. He often fooled around with other people’s wives and had been beaten several times as a result, but I know he was actually going crazy from being so lonely and wanted to find someone to talk to."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where is your biological mother?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They divorced when I was young, and my mother remarried. She passed away a few years ago."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Was there any contact between the two of them?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They were basically strangers. Although my custody went to my dad in court, I lived with my mom when my dad was in jail. At that time, my mom had given birth to a baby with my stepdad and focused all her energy on the baby. She didn’t care about me much. I was like an outsider in their home. I also hated my dad at that time. Why did he get a divorce and why did he have to go to jail? Then my dad got out of jail and got a decent job. He saved his salary &nbsp;to put me through school. No matter what outsiders say about my father, I know that he treated me truly well. Better than how my mother treated me..." At this point, Geng Qing had to wipe away her tears again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Old Chen, look at this." Lin Dongxue opened the mailbox on QQ and found a whistle-blowing letter in it. It was riddled with typos, and she could just barely make out the meaning. It basically talked about how Director Wei had embezzled money, misappropriated wages, and led an immoral lifestyle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This was written by Geng Zhangle. It seems that their relationship isn’t that simple..." Chen Shi suddenly saw Geng Qing's boyfriend's face reflected in the computer screen. When he turned around, Wang Mengqi was standing at the door and eavesdropping.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Mengqi said, as if to hide his embarrassment, "Little Qing, the joss paper has run out, where did you put the rest?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"In the big bag next to the sofa."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Mengqi left with an "Oh".</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The conversation topic returned to the whistle-blowing letter. Lin Dongxue speculated, "Maybe Geng Zhangle was really holding something over Director Wei somehow. Could it be that Director Wei couldn't bear it any longer..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"And committed murder to silence him?" Geng Qing asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s investigate that!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Geng Qing saw the two off, and Chen Shi asked her, "How long have you known your boyfriend?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"More than two years."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How was his relationship with your dad?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Very good. He often bought things for my dad. He bought the color TV, refrigerator, and massage machine at home. My dad even praised him for his filial piety, but recently..." Geng Qing stopped talking. "Forget it, I should tell you. Recently, my dad had planned to set me up with the son of Factory Director Wei. I don’t know what the hell he was doing. Mengqi and I’ve been dating for two years. We have even reached the point of discussing marriage. Why did he organize a blind date for me? He said that Little Wei had a good family background and was highly educated. He might be taking over as the factory director in the future. For this reason, my dad and I quarrelled, and in the end, I didn't go on the blind date."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Does your boyfriend know?"</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, there are no secrets between the two of us. He said that my dad just loves to fawn on the rich and to just ignore him."</span></p>
