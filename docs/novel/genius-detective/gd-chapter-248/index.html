 <p>Chapter 248: You Can’t be Saved<span id="footnote-ref-0751"><a href="#footnote-0751">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, “What do you plan to do?”</p>
 <p>“Find her and sort this out! By the way, I don't know her current address, so I have to ask you for help. You must have connections with the police, right?”</p>
 <p>“I can find her, but don't do anything impulsive.”</p>
 <p>“I won't! I'll just sew her up down there with a needle and thread... Haha, just kidding!” Wang Daji smiled, and patted Chen Shi's shoulder, “I love looking at your expressions. I love her very much; I won't do anything to her. I plan to give her money and let her leave this place.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“If I fool you, then I’m a puppy<span id="footnote-ref-2b56"><a href="#footnote-2b56">[2]</a></span>.”</p>
 <p>“What's your wife's name?”</p>
 <p>“Su Ruijuan! This is her ID number...”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pulled out his cell phone and called a local policeman he had worked with before. After exchanging a few words, Chen Shi asked him to check Su Ruijuan's current address. The other party found it quickly and informed Chen Shi.</p>
 <p>The two drove to the neighborhood, and along the way, Wang Daji boasted repeatedly about his “glorious deeds” over the past few years, and gave Chen Shia headache from listening to it. Those glorious deeds were all debts he had to bear.</p>
 <p>Wang Daji looked for his wife's place in the neighborhood. When he found that his wife's window had the curtains closed, he yelled, “There must be someone at her home!” Then he went upstairs in a hurry.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi hurried to catch up with him and stopped him before he was going to knock, “Calm down!”</p>
 <p>“I'm calm!” Wang Daji gasped.</p>
 <p>A couple were moaning licentiously in the room, and Wang Daji whispered, “Slut! Giving me a green hat again!”</p>
 <p>“Adultery isn’t illegal. If you beat someone, it would break the law. Go downstairs. I'll deal with it.”</p>
 <p>“How?!”</p>
 <p>Wang Daji listened through the door and cursed while listening, “Slut, I don't know where the adulterer came from... Motherfucker, it’s lasting quite a while as well... She didn’t yell like that when she and I did the deed… I’m so angry!”</p>
 <p>Next to him, Chen Shi listened to his muttering and thought that the guy had a unique hobby, so he didn’t bother to worry about him anymore.</p>
 <p>He ran to the stairs above and sat smoking, waiting for Wang Daji to get things sorted out.</p>
 <p>Wang Daji deliberately waited for the right opportunity. He said to Chen Shi, “I’ll wait for that guy to get to the point where he’s about to shoot his wad, and scare him so that he wilts, haha!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>When he heard the man in the room start moaning loudly, Wang Daji pounded on the door wildly and shouted, “Su Ruijuan, open the door. Your man is back! Don't pretend like you’re not in. I know someone’s in there!”</p>
 <p>After waiting for five minutes, the door opened, and Chen Shi saw a disheveled woman through the gaps in the staircase railings.</p>
 <p>Wang Daji pushed past her and looked around, “Where is the man hiding?”</p>
 <p>“What man? You didn’t come back for three years, leaving me alone to rot. Isn’t it okay for me to buy a dildo so I can at least have some pleasure?”</p>
 <p>“Fuck! Hiding in the washing machine, huh? Brother, I tried this trick long ago. It doesn't work!”</p>
 <p>A terrified male voice said, “Brother, I was wrong.”</p>
 <p>“Get lost, get lost, get lost!”</p>
 <p>A shirtless man ran out with a pile of clothes, without even wearing his shoes.</p>
 <p>Wang Daji began to accuse, “Explain to me what happened in that video?”</p>
 <p>“What video?”</p>
 <p>“What video do you think?”</p>
 <p>“You left me and those bastards came. They gave me drugs and raped me. Now you come back and try to blame me? Wow, what a guy!”</p>
 <p>“I’ve settled it with that bastard. I've watched that shit more than ten times. You were drugged? I think you enjoyed it quite a bit!”</p>
 <p>“I'm just a woman. What can I do? Fight them desperately? If you don't come back, I'm stuck here every day and even if I were to scream, even the heavens wouldn’t answer me...” The woman started crying.</p>
 <p>“Don’t play this game with me! While I wasn’t home, how many green hats have you given me? Talk!”</p>
 <p>“I gave you green hats, and so what? You bastard! You only know how to hide when things happen. Your balls are just for show!”</p>
 <p>“Slut, see how I’ll fix you!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah I’m a slut. You wouldn’t have liked me if I wasn’t cheap!”</p>
 <p>“Fuck, I’ll sort you out right now.”</p>
 <p>Then there was a woman's cry in the room, and Wang Daji gasped as he said, “You’re nearly as wet as a river, you bitch!” The woman giggled.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi sighed, <em>W</em><em>hy do I have to listen to this?</em></p>
 <p>Five minutes later, the two seemed to be done and were whispering to each other in the room. Chen Shi was already impatient, and he received a message from Lin Dongxue. “I'll go to your house to find you.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi replied, “I'm flagging down customers right now.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue didn't reply and Chen Shi thought it was all over for him. He immediately went downstairs to knock on the door.</p>
 <p>The woman said in the room, “There’s someone outside?”</p>
 <p>Wang Daji said, “My new underling.”</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you invite him in? It’s cold in the corridor.”</p>
 <p>“Why should I call him in? For a threesome? How can you think of such a thing?”</p>
 <p>“Let me see what he looks like!”</p>
 <p>“As handsome as me!”</p>
 <p>“Who are you fooling? Except for Guo Fucheng<span id="footnote-ref-8e47"><a href="#footnote-8e47">[3]</a></span>, who would be as handsome as my Chen Shi.”</p>
 <p>“Little bitch, you really know how to sweet talk me. Let me sort you out again…”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi knocked on the door again, and Wang Daji shouted, “Go downstairs and wait for me!” Then he muttered, “Underlings nowadays are getting more and more unruly.”</p>
 <p>The woman said, “If you have something to do, you can go first. You won’t be leaving me again now that you’ve come back, right?”</p>
 <p>“Relax, I won't go.”</p>
 <p>“When will you marry me?”</p>
 <p>“When I have finished handling some affairs here, I'll marry you! Take this money.”</p>
 <p>“Chen Shi, what do you think I am? Do you think I love your money?”</p>
 <p>“Don't you love me because I’m rich?”</p>
 <p>The two laughed together.</p>
 <p>Hearing the door opening, Chen Shi hurried down to the landing below. Wang Daji came down while putting on his clothes, and glared at Chen Shi, “Why were you rushing me?”</p>
 <p>“I have some matters to sort out at home.”</p>
 <p>“Let's go!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the woman came out, and two “Chen Shi” were both standing on the stair landing. If they were seen, it would be game over, so Wang Daji quickly slipped away.</p>
 <p>Su Ruijuan came over and said to Chen Shi, “It was your underling who went down just now?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, what an unruly guy.” Chen Shi tried to imitate Wang Daji's tone of voice as much as possible.</p>
 <p>Su Ruijuan glanced downward, “It's quite rude. He didn’t even say hello when he saw his boss’s wife.” Then she took Chen Shi's hand, put a charm into his palm, and said, “I prayed for this at Dabei Temple for you. It’s a peace charm. Take it with you!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi had to accept, “Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Su Ruijuan suddenly embraced Chen Shi and kissed him. Chen Shi, who was afraid to blow his cover, had to play along. While the two were French kissing for as long as a minute, Wang Daji was standing on the stairs below with his fists clenched tight.</p>
 <p>After the kiss, Su Ruijuan said to Chen Shi while hugging him. “You must stay safe; I won’t ask for anything else. I just want us to live safely and stably for the rest of our lives... If you continue to fool around outside, I will continue to give you green hats!”</p>
 <p>“You slut.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I'm your slut.”</p>
 <p>Su Ruijuan smiled and was about to kiss him again. Chen Shi stopped her and said, “I have to go.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll wait for you!”</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi went downstairs, Su Ruijuan shouted down, “Whoever you are, take good care of your boss.”</p>
 <p>Going downstairs, Wang Daji slapped Chen Shi's shoulder and laughed, “Is my girl's oral skill very good? You haven't experienced another kind of oral skill though. I’m warning you, don't come over here to try it when I’m not around!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi wiped the saliva around his mouth and said indignantly, “Do you think everyone is like you?”</p>
 <p>“Well, I really love her cheap look.”</p>
 <p>“You can’t be saved!”</p>
