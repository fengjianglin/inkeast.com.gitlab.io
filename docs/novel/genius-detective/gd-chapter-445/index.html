 <p>Chen Shi raised his hands, indicating that he was not a threat. He kept staring at the man's eyes with a smile, seeming to be very calm.</p>
 <p>The man flicked his pistol to the side. "Give him the cigarettes."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi handed over the cigarettes to a male employee. The male employee trembled slightly as he helped the gunman. Due to his trembling hands, he couldn’t light the cigarette up for a long time. The gunman was getting annoyed and slapped the employee’s head. The employee immediately started bleeding.</p>
 <p>Then, the gunman snatched the lighter to light the cigarette himself. Once he was done, he exhaled in delight.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi looked at the injured employee before asking the man, "How should I address you?"</p>
 <p>"Call me Brother Fei!"</p>
 <p>"Brother Fei, you don't seem to be from this company. Why did you hijack this bus? Do you have any requirements?"</p>
 <p>"Take a guess!"</p>
 <p>"Give me a hint!"</p>
 <p>"Drive first."</p>
 <p>"Do you mean you want the driver to drive?!” Chen Shi repeated, making sure that Lin Qiupu could hear clearly over the radio.</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said, "The bus must never be driven. There’s a motorway nearby and it’ll be really troublesome if he were to get out of here."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled. "There’s a motorway over there in front of you. You have a gun in your hand. If the driver gets nervous and causes a traffic accident, everyone here will die!"</p>
 <p>"You drive!"</p>
 <p>"I don’t know how to drive."</p>
 <p>"Get the police outside to get lost!" Brother Fei shouted loudly.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said to the radio, "Everyone back away. Back ten meters away."</p>
 <p>The policemen began to retreat and Brother Fei looked at the scene outside the window. He believed that the negotiating expert wielded true power. He said, "Didn’t you want a hint earlier? I’ll give you one now. The president of this company is my wife!”</p>
 <p>"Really?" Chen Shi looked around. Almost all of them were young guys. Several of them looked pretty good. "Do you think your wife is giving you a green hat to wear?<span id="footnote-ref-7757"><a href="#footnote-7757">[1]</a></span>"</p>
 <p>Brother Fei smiled. "It's not that I think that way. It's a fact!"</p>
 <p>"Who is that little three... I have a suggestion. You should take him as a hostage and let the others go. There’s no need to involve all the people in a company for this kind of thing, don’t you think?"</p>
 <p>Lin Qiupu said over on the radio, "What nonsense are you talking about?!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi pointed to the back. "Look how blocked the traffic is outside. The weather is so hot. You should also consider the other drivers! I can tell that you’re not an impulsive type of person. Please consider my opinion."</p>
 <p>Brother Fei sneered and then pointed out several employees. "Him, him, him, him... They are all little threes! I can't even fucking count how many green hats are on my head. I’ve long since become a massive field over here...” Then, he kicked an employee’s seat from the back. “Stand up and talk about how your boss hired you!”</p>
 <p>The employee who got picked stood up trembling. "At the second round of interviews, the company suddenly notified me that the interview location was changed and told me to go to a hotel. When I got to the hotel, I met President Yuan. She was very polite to me and we chatted for a very long time. Then, she told me..." He glanced nervously at the gunman. "She told me to take off my clothes. I couldn't refuse, so I took them off. And then... Then, I did that stuff with President Yuan!"</p>
 <p>"How many times?! How many times in total since you joined the company?!" Brother Fei shouted frantically.</p>
 <p>The male employee was so frightened that sweat pooled on his forehead. He couldn’t not tell the truth. "Over ten times... The company goes into overtime every night. In fact... it’s so someone stays with President Yuan overnight…”</p>
 <p>“Sit down!" Brother Fei grabbed the arm of another male employee. "You. Talk about your glorious deeds!"</p>
 <p>This male employee was even more scared than the previous one. He cried as soon as he stood up. "Brother Fei, you really can’t blame us for this. President Yuan gives us a high salary and we receive good treatment. Although there’s this kind of ‘corporate culture’, we can’t do anything about it. We can only do as we’re told.”</p>
 <p>Somewhere on the bus someone whispered, “Yeah, President Yuan is wild like wolves and tigers. Can you blame us?”</p>
 <p>"Who said that?! Stand up!" Brother Fei turned around and pointed his gun at the group of silent employees. Unfortunately, he didn't find the suspect, so he vented his anger out on the young man's head. He hit his head with the gun as he shouted, "When you fucking fucked my wife, weren’t you real cocky? 'Mine is bigger than your husband’s.' Did you say that?! Did you say that?!"</p>
 <p>The young man held up his hands to block him and replied as if he was wronged, "I haven't said those kinds of things."</p>
 <p>"I’ll shoot you to death!"</p>
 <p>"Don't be impulsive! Brother!" Chen Shi hurried to stop him.</p>
 <p>It seemed like Brother Fei had already investigated it and the guy had to admit. "I'm sorry, Brother. I said it without thinking at the time. It’s just nonsense. It doesn’t mean anything... If I knew you were such a hero, I definitely wouldn’t have said that."</p>
 <p>"Slapping the horse’s bottom?!<span id="footnote-ref-8569"><a href="#footnote-8569">[2]</a></span> You’re slapping the horse’s bottom!" Brother Fei roared while beating him. "You worked overtime the most!"</p>
 <p>"Brother, stop beating him. I understand now. They are all victims."</p>
 <p>"Victims?" Brother Fei stopped and laughed out loud. "This whole group is a male harem my wife is raising. She’s happily playing around the whole day. As soon as she gets home, she acts like a busy and independent woman, and faces me with an emotionless face all day while ignoring me. So it turns out that outside, she was... I’ll give you guys a chance now. Whoever had sex with my wife, raise your hand! If you dare hide it from me, I’ll shoot!"</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at each other as seven or eight people raised their hands one after another. A young guy asked, "Does that count?" Then, he raised his hand.</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was shocked. This really was a male harem. So many employees were giving Brother Fei the green hat. What a "harmonious" company atmosphere. He couldn't help but be a little curious. "Is President Yuan taking advantage of her position to forcefully take advantage of her subordinates?"</p>
 <p>"No, no. In fact, President Yuan looks really pretty. She has a pair of monolid phoenix eyes that can draw people in."</p>
 <p>"She also has a hot body. She goes to the gym almost every day."</p>
 <p>"So, we’re also happy to work overtime."</p>
 <p>"No other IT company has this benefit. I heard about this, so I applied for this job.”</p>
 <p>Everyone discussed it all at the same time as if they had forgotten their present situation. Brother Fei pulled at his hair frantically. "You’re still talking?! You’re still talking about it?! I’ll kill you all!" Everyone became so frightened that they stopped talking.</p>
 <p>Brother Fei shook the gun in his hand agitatedly and said to Chen Shi, "You see?! What kind of life am I living? As a man, do I still have even the slightest drop of dignity left? I didn't plan to get out of this bus alive when I got on!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi was afraid that the gun in his hand would misfire and said, "Calm down. I understand your troubles. In fact, the law is not without a solution. You can divorce your wife. Why do you have to take such extreme means?"</p>
 <p>Brother Fei shouted, "If it were you, would you be able to accept this kind of thing?! Dignity. How can I compensate for my dignity as a man?! Even if we’re divorced, everyone in the world would look down on me. How can I live on in the future?!”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi thought about how the whole world would only know about it because he made such a big commotion about it.</p>
 <p>He must calm him down right now, so Chen Shi changed the subject. "I'm curious. Your wife betrayed you like this. How did you two meet and get married? Can you talk to me about this?"</p>
 <p>"It's that bitch who used me!"</p>
