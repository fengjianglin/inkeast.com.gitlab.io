 <p style="text-align: left"><span>On January 26</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Long'an University of Science and Technology.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After class, Professor Zhuge stopped a student and said, "Go and have a look. Is that man at the door?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The student came back and said that he wasn’t there before Professor Zhuge left the classroom with confidence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Recently, a man who claimed to be a police consultant had been coming to him with a thick stack of files. While he was indeed the leading aerospace expert in China, that didn’t mean that he was obliged to help them solve the case. It was close to the end of the year. There were many miscellaneous affairs at the school and he really didn't have the leisure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Professor Zhuge went to the faculty canteen with a textbook in his hand, ordered a few of his favorite dishes, unscrewed a small bottle of alcohol, and tasted it pleasurably.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi appeared in front of him unexpectedly and Professor Zhuge was startled. He picked up the tray, got up, and was about to leave. However, Chen Shi held his wrist and asked, "Professor, why are you hiding from me? Am I scary?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re not scary, you’re annoying! I’m very busy, can you stop looking for me?!" Professor Zhuge said bitterly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s a matter regarding a life. Please take a look at the design blueprint."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s a matter regarding a life? Which one of your police affairs isn’t a matter of life and death? Just because of these words, you don’t have to do other things? Right now, I have to create test papers and write a paper. Can you stop trying to find me for your affairs? Please... If we take a step back and say that I have time right now, it’s my freedom whether I help you or not. Hurry up and don’t disturb me while I eat!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After being so blunt, Chen Shi was still unwilling to make concessions. Professor Zhuge had never met such a brazen person like him before. He finally had to make a concession reluctantly and ask a graduate student to take a look before he could send the "Plague God" away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason why Chen Shi had come to find an expert to verify matters was because he found a point of suspicion. Dong Xiao claimed to be three hundred catties, but only when he visited Dong Xiao’s personal doctor did he realize that it was him being "modest". The latest measurement showed that Dong Xiao’s actual weight was more than five hundred catties.<span id="footnote-ref-e376"><a href="#footnote-e376">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The load of that rocket was about 300 kilograms. Could it be that Dong Xiao was not put in at all? Could it be that he didn’t fit even if it could bear the load? Could a part of him still be left on the earth?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rocket lifting into the sky already meant there was no evidence. In fact, Lin Qiupu had been to the observatory and there was no corpse in the vast starry sky. Only things on the ground could be checked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was working hard with this glimmer of hope. This case was now like a point of anxiety. Only when it is solved could he sleep well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Dongxue was also working hard. In the past few days, she and Su Chan had met several times in private. She learned about her life experience. She was an orphan and was adopted by an entrepreneur when she was a child. Because of her outstanding beauty, she was raised at home by her adoptive father until she was 18, and her education was also done by home tutors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"One day, my adoptive father asked me to seduce a director and obtain information about stocks from him. All my previous education was in music, etiquette, dance, media response, etc. I didn't know what to do. My adoptive father grabbed a mirror and told me that I had the most powerful weapon in the world!" Su Chan stroked her face and gave a wry smile. "I managed to get the information, but I also lost a girl’s first time. The old man who took my first time was quickly forced into bankruptcy by my adoptive father, and he carried billions of yuan in debt on his back. What was the price of a piece of film<span id="footnote-ref-038c"><a href="#footnote-038c">[2]</a></span> compared to this? My adoptive father praised me and gave me many rewards, but I just couldn’t be happy. Since then, I have become a tool. A weapon!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the third meeting between the two. Su Chan already regarded Lin Dongxue as a friend. The two had many things in common. They were both women and orphans, but Su Chan was very envious of Lin Dongxue's ability to live like an ordinary person who dared to love and hate with no need to act deliberately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If I help you get that trade secret, you’ll provide evidence to sue Lu Qi?" Lin Dongxue asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, this evidence will definitely keep him in prison for a lifetime."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't you have no feelings for Lu Qi?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan laughed coldly. "I know how to make men fall in love with me, but I have never loved anyone. Lu Qi doesn’t amount to much at all. He’s just a naive and conceited big boy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm a bit sour<span id="footnote-ref-ecff"><a href="#footnote-ecff">[3]</a></span> after hearing these words." Lin Dongxue smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can teach you as well. You have a lot of potential, but you don't know how to use it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Forget it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Chan blinked. "Talk to your captain and arrange a search. As long as you find the document and quietly hand it to me, I will give you the evidence of Lu Qi's murder. Hurry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Right, since you’re still looking for that confidential document, what was in the USB flash drive you found in Dong Xiao's office previously?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Take a guess."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You don't want to hand it over, so it seems that the contents still have transactional value. Could it be that Dong Xiao collected Lu Qi's previous criminal evidence?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Officer Lin is really smart. The content is very impactful. I hope you can see it sooner rather than later."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After talking, she walked away and got into the car outside the café. She attracted the attention of a bunch of men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Lin Dongxue was willing to believe in Su Chan, Lin Qiupu's attitude was completely the opposite. He resolutely said, "We’re not making a deal. How can you be sure that she has evidence? How do you know that she’s not fooling you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I believe her!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You believe her? Do you know what kind of woman she is? Deception and lying are commonplace for her." Lin Qiupu said very confidently, making Lin Dongxue extremely unhappy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's been so long and there’s been no progress at all. We’re constantly back at square one. Why can't we be a bit more flexible? Is principle more important than solving the case?" Lin Dongxue said in disagreement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lin Qiupu seemed to have heard these words recently. He said, "I think you have stayed with someone for a long time and have been influenced by him. Of course principle is above all else. To use illegal means to solve the case is something I won’t do!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How can this be considered illegal?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re assisting a commercial spy to steal intelligence, understand?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have other plans for this matter. When Lu Qi's case is over, we will investigate Su Chan's side again to find out who the mastermind behind the scenes controlling her is. Encouraging this behavior is only temporary."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She thought that Su Chan's adoptive father didn't seem to be a good person either. In this way, Su Chan would no longer have to do this kind of thing in the future. It would kill two birds with one stone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Lin Qiupu still insisted, "We do not trade with criminals no matter what type of criminals they are. It’s impossible!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What was originally a shortcut to solve the case was easily denied by him. Lin Dongxue was going crazy with anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Chen Shi made some progress. After a lively discussion with Professor Zhuge’s graduate students, they believed that the carrying capacity of this private rocket couldn’t hold 500 catties of weight, and the overly fat body would seriously affect the stability and balance of the rocket, resulting in a crash. They repeatedly watched the video of the rocket when it lifted off, analyzed the data at the time, and came up with a bold conjecture that the rocket might be empty.</span></p>
 <p id="h.gjdgxs" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, Dong Xiao's body was very likely still hidden somewhere on the earth!</span></p>
