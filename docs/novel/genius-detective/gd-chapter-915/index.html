 <p>“...The local geologist pried the stone slab away and finally found a substance inside. It’s the culprit that caused the mysterious self-heating mechanism on the ground’s surface, and its name is lime!"</p>
 <p>"Fuck your uncle!" Lin Dongxue was so angry that she laughed.</p>
 <p>"I don't want to watch this kind of show, it's too awful." Chen Shi took a sip of the alcohol on the table.</p>
 <p>"Husband, I want to take a sip too."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi brought the iced whiskey to her mouth, and Lin Dongxue sniffed it. "It smells like chocolate."</p>
 <p>"That’s because it’s an 18-year-old Chivas. I usually can't bear to drink it."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue leaned on Chen Shi and took a sip before smiling, "Sure enough, I still can't drink." But she took another sip, and it was so strong that she poked her tongue out.</p>
 <p>"Why are you still drinking if you can’t manage it?"</p>
 <p>"This is the taste of our first day of marriage. When I drink this kind of alcohol in the future, I will think of this day. I’m so happy today."</p>
 <p>There were no lights on in the house, and the two cuddled on the sofa. The whole house was filled with warmth and sweetness. Chen Shi heard pattering sounds outside and said, "It's raining!"</p>
 <p>"Why don't we go to bed early?"</p>
 <p>"You won’t be able to fall asleep so early."</p>
 <p>"If we can't sleep, we can do something else!"</p>
 <p>"For example…"</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door from outside, and Chen Shi immediately understood when he heard the frequency of the knocks. "Yueyue? No, why would she suddenly come back?"</p>
 <p>Opening the door, it turned out that it was really Yueyue. Since she hadn’t used an umbrella, she was completely drenched. As soon as she saw Chen Shi, her emotions overflowed, and she cried, "Wuuuwuuu, Uncle Chen, I don’t want to stay at that lousy police academy anymore."</p>
 <p>"What's the matter, did someone bully you? Come in quickly!"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi took a towel and wiped her head dry. Lin Dongxue poured her a cup of hot tea. Tao Yueyue sat on the table, cupping the hot tea in her hands. She looked around, discovered that a few more pieces of furniture had been added, and said, "These..."</p>
 <p>"Your Uncle Chen and I have gotten married, so I moved over to live here. Please take care of me in the future." Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>Noticing that Lin Dongxue was still wearing Chen Shi's shirt, Tao Yueyue asked, "Did I disturb the two of you?"</p>
 <p>"No, no, how could that be." Lin Dongxue smiled and stroked her head. "What happened to you at the police academy? Haven't you been doing military training recently? Is it a matter relating to military training?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue nodded, tears welling up in her eyes again. "The instructor isn’t reasonable at all. I suspect that he suffers from long-term repression and has nowhere to vent, so he’s taking it out on us. Some classmates can't march properly so he made the whole row of us accompany them in practicing, dragging out the lessons everyday. We don’t get to eat anything by the time we arrive at the cafeteria. We train on empty stomachs in the afternoon. Every morning he wakes us up and makes us go for a run before the sun rises. It was raining today so everyone wanted to go back to the dormitory as soon as possible, but the instructor didn’t let us go. I don’t know who it was, but someone scolded him in a whisper, so he interrogated all of us while making a big fuss. Then the whole class was made guilty by association and stood in the rain for an hour. This wasn’t training at all. It was corporal punishment. He was abusing his authority for personal reasons. I hate him!"</p>
 <p>As she recalled these events, she gripped the cup so hard that it squeaked in her hands.</p>
 <p>"It seems that your instructor is a bit harsh, but we’ve all experienced this kind of thing. The police are half counted as soldiers, and military training is definitely indispensable." Lin Dongxue said.</p>
 <p>"I really don't want to understand the purpose behind this kind of training!" Tao Yueyue said, "Is it possible that I will meet a criminal in the future and kick him to death while marching?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled bitterly and took out a bottle of Coke from the refrigerator. Lin Dongxue complained, "It's such a cold day..."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue really liked Coke more, especially since she hadn’t consumed sugar over the past month. She drank half of it after opening it. Chen Shi said, "The training itself is actually mostly meaningless. I underwent military training back then, and just like you, I was full of resentment, cursing that the instructor would die every night. Military training is actually for training you to be obedient, because the police team is a whole unit. Every police officer must learn to obey orders. This kind of obedience starts from military training and slowly penetrates into your bone marrow."</p>
 <p>"Have you been trained to be obedient?" Tao Yueyue asked.</p>
 <p>"Some people will become obedient after military training, and some people will learn to restrain their own personalities. From the overall perspective, both results are the purpose of military training. I can be said to be the latter. You can ignore them, but you have to learn to put away your edge. This isn’t only for being a police officer, but also for future survival in society."</p>
 <p>"The problem is I'm very obedient. I can do all the moves the instructor asks us to do. I came in number nine in the girls’ long-distance race. However, as long as one person makes a mistake, everyone will have to follow them in misery. It's not fair at all!"</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said to Chen Shi, "This instructor is indeed too harsh. Should we go to the police academy and give the academy some suggestions?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi immediately rejected this notion. "This kind of precedent cannot be set. I used to be a driver and a common man. If I had gone over to give suggestions, that would have been okay. Now that I’m the captain of the criminal police force, most of the instructors in the police academy aren’t ranked as high as me. If I went over to talk to them, isn't this the same as abusing my authority for personal gain?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue became angry. "I'm going to be tortured to death by that bastard, but you won't help me?"</p>
 <p>"This is a hurdle you must surmount yourself. I really can't help you. Pampering you now is tantamount to harming you."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue seemed to be about to slam the door and leave at any time. Lin Dongxue said, "Tomorrow, I’ll go over and talk to them. I’m a rank and file police officer. This wouldn’t be an abuse of power."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue pouted and wanted to cry. "What if it's useless even after you talk to them?"</p>
 <p>"Then let Elder Sister teach you a trick. If you can't stand it, you can faint or cry. Girls have to learn to show weakness. In fact, a lot of those instructors who seem awe-inspiring have never been in love so they’ll be helpless once they see a girl cry." Lin Dongxue winked. "I used this trick back then. During the hottest days, I said that my stomach hurt and I cried so much that the instructor asked me to go back and rest first. "</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue's small, pouting mouth slowly revealed a smile, and she asked shyly, "Does it really work?"</p>
 <p>"It works, it’s been put to repeated tests. Haven’t any girls in your class asked for leave?"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue thought for a moment. "It seems that there really were some girls who did. I will try it tomorrow."</p>
 <p>"Okay, the problem is solved." Chen Shi breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>"You weren’t the one who solved it. Why are you so smug?" Tao Yueyue didn’t forget to retaliate against him.</p>
 <p>"Damn child, wasn’t I anxious for you too?"</p>
 <p>"I couldn’t tell."</p>
 <p>"How did you come out? Did you climb the wall?"</p>
 <p>"I'm not the only one who fled home secretly. Can I sleep here tonight? There’s also a bitch in the dormitory who happens to be the daughter of the deputy mayor. She’s so annoying. Uncle Chen, if you still won’t help me, I will definitely find a chance to teach her a lesson."</p>
 <p>Chen Shi smiled bitterly, it was as if he had seen his past self. Life in a collective was a nightmare for someone like him who didn’t fit in personality-wise.</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue said, "I think you can exert your power judiciously and let everyone know that Yueyue is the child of the criminal police force captain. The relationships between girls are very delicate. I don't want to say bad things about anyone, but back then my roommates knew that I was an orphan and indeed made things hard for me. When my brother was promoted to the position of captain, the situation got better."</p>
 <p>"If they knew that you were Lie Guoxiao's daughter back then, wouldn’t they have carried you around in a palanquin?" Chen Shi quipped.</p>
 <p>"You’re insane. Don't mention that person again." Lin Dongxue punched him.</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue stood up. "I'm going to take a shower..." She walked to the door of the bathroom, then turned her head and asked, "It wouldn’t disturb your late-night mating, right?"</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said, "We’ve become shameless long ago. It won’t bother us."</p>
 <p>After Tao Yueyue entered the bathroom, Lin Dongxue blushed. "I guess it will take me a while to get used to your family’s way of life."</p>
