 <p><strong>Volume 19: Bottle Cap Murder</strong></p>
 <p>Early next morning, Chen Shi looked hurriedly for Peng Sijue. He was sitting at his desk in a daze with a cup of coffee in his hands. Chen Shi said, “Last night's message...”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue slowly put down the coffee and slapped the computer, saying, “The DNA left by Zhou Xiao did not match anyone in the database. I slightly loosened the matching parameters and found a close relative, a prisoner who had been executed due to the death penalty. A profile of a person named Wang Sunlei appeared on the computer. He had committed several counts of intentional homicide and was executed five years ago.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi stared at the face for a long time and said, “He was arrested by Song Lang himself. Wang Sunlei had injected cyanide into a certain brand’s beverage in a poisoning case, resulting in the death of more than a dozen people in Long’an. It was ruled an indiscriminate homicide case, but Song Lang believed that he had specific targets. Sure enough, after arresting him, they found out that who he had really wanted to kill were his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. The others were only collateral victims that obscured the police investigation.”</p>
 <p>“I checked Wang Sunlei's information and found out that he had a younger brother named Wang Sunxu. When Wang Sunlei was arrested, Wang Sunxu was only twelve years old. As a relative of the murderer, he must have run into many obstacles in society and suffered social ostracization. It’s not surprising that he would go down the path of evil.”</p>
 <p>“He’s Zhou Xiao?”</p>
 <p>“You said that you thought that ‘Zhou Xiao’ was just a gang code. The DNA belongs to Wang Sunxu. He was the one who killed Wang Daji that day and is probably guilty of several other murders.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi muttered, “If you find him, you will be able to track down the whole gang and find the person who killed Han Luoxi that year! I’ll tell Captain Lin the news.”</p>
 <p>“No need. I've notified him already and the kid is now being hunted across the city.”</p>
 <p>The goal that was thought to be out of reach was suddenly close at hand. Chen Shi found it a little hard to believe. The name “Zhou Xiao” was a sickness in his heart. Can it really be cured this year?</p>
 <p>He hoped so!</p>
 <p>In the quiet office, only the sound of Peng Sijue slowly sipping coffee could be heard. Chen Shi asked, “Are you free this afternoon?”</p>
 <p>“How could I be free?”</p>
 <p>“Tonight then. Don't work overtime tonight. I'll take you to a place.”</p>
 <p>“Is it important?”</p>
 <p>“It's quite important to you.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue still had to deal with the follow-up work on a case today. Chen Shi was still the same. When the case was solved, he just left and continued with his taxi services. Lately, he had been investigating cases frequently so driving had become a form of relaxation instead. Customers get into the car, choose their destinations, and he sends them there. It's like completing a small simple mission. Psychologically speaking, people will derive fun from completing simple tasks. Games are just like that.</p>
 <p>In the evening, Lin Dongxue heard the familiar car sounds coming through the window; she quickly instructed the team members about tomorrow's tasks, and then said, “No need to work overtime today. Get off work!”</p>
 <p>She put on her coat, ran out, opened the door and rushed into the car, kissing Chen Shi.</p>
 <p>After five minutes of sweet embraces, Chen Shi gently pushed her away and said, “Want to go to a playground tonight?”</p>
 <p>“As long as I’m with you!” Lin Dongxue sat on Chen Shi's lap, her arms around his neck, and the glow of love made her face red.</p>
 <p>“No, I have to bring someone else...Old Peng!”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“I suspect…”</p>
 <p>After Chen Shi told her, Lin Dongxue said in surprise, “Captain Peng has depression?”</p>
 <p>“That’s what I’m guessing. I feel that he’s been in a bad mood recently. I think the work pressure and stress is too great for him to handle. Old Peng is a workaholic and doesn't know how to rest. I'm really worried that he’ll collapse someday.”</p>
 <p>“You are so nice to him!”</p>
 <p>“Are you jealous?” Chen Shi smiled and poked Lin Dongxue's forehead with a finger.</p>
 <p>After a while, Peng Sijue sat in the car and said, “Dongxue is here as well? Are we going to investigate a case?”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Chen Shi lied.</p>
 <p>“Then I'll get the tools.”</p>
 <p>“No, no, it’s fine.”</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Peng Sijue was taken to the entertainment center of a shopping mall. Although it was not a weekend, there were still many parents with their children there. Peng Sijue didn’t like bustling places and frowned slightly.</p>
 <p>“We’re investigating a case?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“Don't worry, the person to be investigated hasn't arrived yet. Would you like to shoot archery?”</p>
 <p>“Not interested.”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi said to the counter, “Archery for three people.”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue was dragged reluctantly to the archery area. Chen Shi knew that the guy was passive and tempted him by picking up a composite bow and arrow and shooting it as if he knew what he was doing. The bow opened like a full moon, but the arrow didn’t look like a shooting star when it flew out. Instead, it flew out in a parabola and fell under the target.</p>
 <p>“What's going on? Not pulling enough?”</p>
 <p>Chen Shi shot another arrow, but the trajectory still wasn’t ideal.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue couldn't stand it any longer and said, “Your technique is not right at all. It isn’t the string that you pull, but the arrow!”</p>
 <p>“I don't understand. Why don't you show me then?”</p>
 <p>“Step aside!”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue picked up the bow and arrow and showed Chen Shi. He hit an arrow in the middle of the target, and Chen Shi said, “Great, your skills haven’t diminished at all.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue shot three arrows under the guidance of the coach and had basically mastered the technique. She proposed, “Captain Peng, let's compete!”</p>
 <p>“Do you know what the only club I joined in college was?”</p>
 <p>“This?”</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue pulled the bow again. This time, he had found the right position. He hit the red center with the arrow. Lin Dongxue applauded, “Wow, great.”</p>
 <p>“I propose ten arrows per person, and we calculate using the total score.” Chen Shi said.</p>
 <p>“I don't want to play. Let's get our work done.” Peng Sijue was ready to put down his bow.</p>
 <p>“This is our work. Don’t be like that.”</p>
 <p>“I really don’t know what to do with you!”</p>
 <p>After archery, Chen Shi took Peng Sijue to enjoy other activities such as bowling, table tennis, shooting, etc. Chen Shi observed his poker face and didn’t see him raise his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth. For Peng Sijue, this showed that he was in a good mood.</p>
 <p>At half past seven, the three were eating dessert, and Peng Sijue was already impatient. “What's the important matter tonight?”</p>
 <p>“Tonight...” Chen Shi said slowly, “I just took you out to have fun. I feel that you’ve been under a lot of pressure recently, and your mood isn’t too good.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, yeah, Captain Peng, being in a good mood is important,” Lin Dongxue agreed.</p>
 <p>Peng Sijue threw down the dessert spoon. “Are you bored or something? Do I need you to care about me? I have so much work to do. I don't have time to play with you!”</p>
 <p>“You have a mental problem.”</p>
 <p>“Is that important?”</p>
 <p>“It’s important! I have known you for so long. I know you. You’re too harsh on yourself and you never know how to relax properly. I’m worried about you.”</p>
 <p>“How long have you known me?” Peng Sijue asked deliberately.</p>
 <p>In the presence of Lin Dongxue, Chen Shi naturally couldn't tell the truth and said, “Although it hasn’t been that long, friendship does not depend on the length of the relationship.”</p>
 <p>“Do you know that it’s arrogant to assume that someone else has a mental problem and to give him so-called help? I am an adult. I can handle my own affairs, and no one needs to help me!” Peng Sijue stood up.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“Going to the toilet.”</p>
 <p>In the end, Peng Sijue never returned. Ten minutes later, Chen Shi received his text message, “Thank you for worrying about me. I'm fine!”</p>
 <p>When Chen Shi was about to pay the bill, the waiter said that the other gentleman had already paid and Chen Shi smiled bitterly at Lin Dongxue, “This awkward person.”</p>
 <p>“I think you used the wrong method, right?” Lin Dongxue said.</p>
