 <p>It was the 11th&nbsp;of October, Golden Week, and Lin Dongxue drove Tao Yueyue to the film and television grounds in the suburbs.</p>
 <p>Many people were traveling there today. Lin Dongxue looked for a place to park her car and took Tao Yueyue’s hand in hers to wander around. Although she had been here before, it had only been for investigating cases. Today, she could finally stroll around leisurely, looking at the small shops around them.</p>
 <p>There were some quaint shops there that sold small souvenirs. Although she didn't plan to buy them, she was very happy to see the dazzling array of goods. Perhaps it was the nature of women.</p>
 <p>"Beautiful lady, hold up!" A man wearing a checkered shirt with sunglasses on the top of his head walked over, smiled, and handed over his business card. "Are you interested in being a star? Our company is now hiring people."</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry. I already have a job." Lin Dongxue turned and left.</p>
 <p>"Hey!" The Sunglasses Man blocked their way. "Think about it. You have such a good temperament. You can make a lot of money as a star."</p>
 <p>"Not interested."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue took Tao Yueyue and walked away. The Sunglasses Man still stubbornly said things to keep her from leaving. Seeing that she had no intention of doing so, he continued to look for other passers-by.</p>
 <p>"Who was that? A scout for celebrities?" Tao Yueyue asked.</p>
 <p>"What scout? I saw his business card and he should be a group leader. It's the kind of intermediary that helps the crew find extras and special actors."</p>
 <p>"Sister Lin, are you often harassed by such people?"</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s annoying even if you’re born too good-looking. I was photographed by a nosy person during my internship at the police academy. It was posted on the Internet and became a small hit under the title of 'The Most Beautiful Police Student'. It annoyed me to death. The secret shots were posted on the Internet as if it was justified. At the time, I thought that I would definitely not be a traffic police officer, a civilian police officer, or any department that needed to show their faces so as not to be photographed again since it was so annoying."</p>
 <p>"Some classmates laughed at me for looking like a boy." Tao Yueyue touched her short hair.</p>
 <p>"You can tell them, ‘So what?’ Does a woman have to be like a woman and a man like a man? There is no need to cater to other people's aesthetics."</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue smiled with relief. "Okay, I will tell it to her like this next time."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue touched Tao Yueyue’s head. "Want to buy souvenirs?"</p>
 <p>"No, I will buy something for you. I’m richer than you now."</p>
 <p>"Richer than me? Hahaha!"</p>
 <p>Regarding the money for selling the copyright of her story, Chen Shi had issued a card for Tao Yueyue and deposited all the money inside. Lin Dongxue said, "Remember to spend less!"</p>
 <p>"I plan to buy some value-preserving things that’ll stay in the bank. Wouldn't it be a loss in case of inflation?" Tao Yueyue said seriously.</p>
 <p>"Then you can discuss with Uncle Chen. His financial knowledge is very high."</p>
 <p>After Chen Shi’s identity was exposed, he told Lin Dongxue about his previous experience. What she admired the most was that he was able to earn a sum of money to buy a house and car when he had completely lost his past identity, savings, and everything, and had to start from scratch again.</p>
 <p>Of course, during the years where he started from scratch again, Chen Shi also suffered a lot and underwent tremendous pressure. Lin Dongxue felt that attractive men were like diamonds, honed through hardship.</p>
 <p>Hearing the words "Uncle Chen", Tao Yueyue remembered the Cold War again and said uncomfortably, "I don't want him to interfere with my affairs!"</p>
 <p>"Well, it's up to you..." Lin Dongxue glanced at her watch. "What time are you meeting the director?"</p>
 <p>"Noon."</p>
 <p>"It's almost time. Let's go over there!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue was invited to participate in the opening ceremony with the film crew. She met the director and screenwriter during the polishing of the script of the film. It was her first time visiting today.</p>
 <p>When they got to a hotel and asked for him at the front desk, a fat uncle wearing black-rimmed glasses walked out of the elevator and called affectionately, "Yueyue?"</p>
 <p>"Uncle Screenwriter!"</p>
 <p>"Haha, you came..." As the screenwriter was talking, his eyes kept looking at Lin Dongxue. "This is?"</p>
 <p>"My mother!" she said, holding Lin Dongxue's arm.</p>
 <p>"Oh, it's Officer Lin. Yueyue mentioned you to me." The screenwriter stretched out his hand and shook Lin Dongxue's hand. "When we wrote the script, we talked for ten hours a week on average, and we met several times to rewrite countless manuscripts to portray the full story... I can finally breathe a sigh of relief."</p>
 <p>"It's hard work in this business."</p>
 <p>"Let’s stop talking while standing. Let's go upstairs!"</p>
 <p>The screenwriter and Tao Yueyue had been acquainted for quite a while. When she entered the elevator, Tao Yueyue couldn't wait to ask, "Uncle screenwriter, who did you decide to use to play me in the end?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, after choosing for a while, there wasn’t a suitable person. There was no temperament quite like yours. Do you want to play as yourself?"</p>
 <p>"Me playing myself?" Tao Yueyue was surprised. "My acting skills aren’t very good. No, I don't have any acting skills at all."</p>
 <p>"Haha, I'm just kidding. The director and producer decided to let Xia Xiaolou be the heroine."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Tao Yueyue looked disappointed. "She is in her forties but she’s acting as me?"</p>
 <p>"She played a high school student in "Quick Dare" and has experience in this area."</p>
 <p>"I'm not saying that she’s inexperienced. It’s just that she’s so old. Is it because she has experience that she will continue acting as a high school student even when she becomes an old lady?"</p>
 <p>"Haha!" The screenwriter was amused and said to Lin Dongxue, "This kid is really interesting to talk to. Chatting with her is always fun. She must be very well-behaved at home, right? Haii, my daughter is the same age, but she is in her rebellious period. She had an early love and I said a few things, so we’ve fallen out with each other."</p>
 <p>Lin Dongxue and Tao Yueyue smiled at each other. It seemed that every family had the same problem.</p>
 <p>The elevator arrived, and the three went out to the corridor. Lin Dongxue said, "I read a report that said that our country's film and television dramas are full of girly characters. As a result, a large number of middle-aged actresses can only play girls."</p>
 <p>"This is also to cater to the market. There’s no other way! It’s also very difficult for us screenwriters. In foreign countries, screenwriters are the most amazing. As long as they say one thing, nobody would oppose it. However, in our country, it’s completely reversed. Everyone in the crew has the right to change the script. If the director said that the scene was too big and the funds weren’t enough, you’d have to change it. If the investor said that they have a person they want to add in, you have to add in a role. The most annoying thing is when there are those big-name actors who change the script all of a sudden, doing whatever they want. Of course, there’s also a review. For example, in this drama, the director said that it wasn’t harmonious that an underage girl was kidnapped, so it had to be changed. In the end, the heroine was changed to a college student."</p>
 <p>"Ah!!" Tao Yueyue was shocked. "This matter has already been in the newspaper. If the newspapers can publish it, why not let it be filmed?"</p>
 <p>"It's not that the filming of it isn’t allowed, but the director is afraid that he won't be able to pass the review, so he first conducted a self-review. This is the norm in our industry."</p>
 <p>"Is there anything else that has changed?" After all, Tao Yueyue was involved in the writing process. She felt very uncomfortable when she heard the news.</p>
 <p>"I'll show you the script in a moment. A lot has changed!"</p>
 <p>Tao Yueyue said to Lin Dongxue, "I have an ominous premonition..."</p>
