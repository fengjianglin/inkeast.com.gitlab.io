 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After listening, Chen Shi questioned, "Do you want us to help you treat the disease or investigate this matter?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Yi replied, "Of course it's to investigate it properly! I think this is a problem of my heart. I can't sleep well unless everything is made clear."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"When did you see the zombie?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Wei Yi took his pants, found the phone from inside, and flipped through it. "September 4</span><span>th</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There are photos on your phone?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I was so scared that I was about to piss my pants. How would I dare take a photo? I was just paid a bonus that day, so I remember it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you remember what car it was? Where was the location?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Yi described it for a long time. Chen Shi guessed that it should be a Nissan Bluebird located diagonally opposite a place called Fumanduo Supermarket on Sanmin Road. Chen Shi nodded. "We will start the investigation right now and visit you later at your house. Don’t go anywhere today, okay? By the way, how do you usually solve your meals?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Home-made instant noodles at home or dumplings."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay, we will call in advance when we come. Otherwise, don't open the door no matter who comes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Yi nodded in agreement, painfully put on his clothes, and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he left, Sun Zhen asked, "He’s unemployed. Can he afford the commission money? The commission money here isn’t cheap."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kk said, "Relax, I asked. He used to be an investment broker. He’s rich and currently has over one million in savings!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"In that case... Do we need to find Miss Gu to see if she can help?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Manshow<span id="footnote-ref-3a60"><a href="#footnote-3a60">[1]</a></span>. You only think about Elder Sister Gu all day and night. Brother Chen is here, so how can we not handle it?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sun Zhen didn’t speak and continued to type up some code on the computer. Chen Shi asked Tao Yueyue, "What do you think of this matter?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tao Yueyue considered for a while. "The zombie must be fake. I think he suddenly got sick due to someone pulling the strings. It was probably a group of robbery gangs, wearing a zombie mask. They were seen by him, and then this gang wanted to get rid of him."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi nodded. "From his narrative, I also smell the signs of a felony. Little Worm, check if there was a criminal case during this time near that location."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Sun Zhen conducted a thorough investigation and spread his palms. "There wasn’t a robbery, but there was a fire on September 3</span><span>rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The news said that it was controlled in time. One middle-aged aunt living alone was burned to death, but there were no other casualties. "</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Address!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Tonghua Community, about three hundred meters away from where the zombie was seen."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's a coincidence in time! Let's go to his house to have a look.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kk said with a smile, "Brother Chen, business is business. This time, we will divide the reward into a third for each of us!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Save it. Yueyue, do you want to get a little reward?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Um... I'll take a thousand yuan to buy clothes and books."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's it then. The rest is yours."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kk smiled. "Yueyue is really the decision-maker in your household."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sun Zhen whispered, "Brother Chen, Brother Chen!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi noticed that he had something to say and asked Yueyue to go down to wait for him first. Sun Zhen said, "I have something to tell you. Have you recently seen Zhou Tiannan?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I've been very busy lately with one case after another. I was only free today."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahem, don't be surprised when I tell you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Stop acting so mysterious."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Zhou Tiannan transferred to another school. The sixth middle school in Long'an City, teaching physics in the third year of junior high."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi was suddenly shocked. This bastard actually moved to Yueyue's school and maybe he was the teacher of her class. Was he deliberately being so slick?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you sure?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We’ve been monitoring Zhou Tiannan the whole time and we know his every move. After all, the existence of this agency is to guard against him and his people."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">kk sat on the table. "We also know that every three to five days, a pretty girl will spend the night at his house. We don’t know what they’re doing. We’re serious people, so we can't imagine it. The girl is different every time. A junior high physics teacher is living the life of fucking nourishment!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is the frequency high?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Once a week. Sometimes twice a week."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zhou Tiannan and his men should have made a lot of money by relying on various dirty activities, but Zhou Tiannan was on the cusp of the police's suspicion and had to act low-key. He didn’t have the opportunity to spend money.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These women who "visit" his house may be filial piety from his men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Monitor this. One day, when Zhou Tiannan suddenly stops getting these prostitutes, you must tell me. You must remember!" Chen Shi instructed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Getting into the car, Chen Shi didn’t drive immediately. He said, "Yueyue, your school..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah?" Tao Yueyue froze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a second thought, Yueyue didn't know the person Zhou Tiannan. It was his capable men who had killed her mother and framed Song Lang under the name "Zhou Xiao". Chen Shi didn't know where to start.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Transferring schools wasn’t very realistic. After all, that group of people were omnipresent. Perhaps they had already understood the basic situation around Chen Shi.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, Black Honey was very quiet. They made a lot of money in the last case of posting the handguns<span id="footnote-ref-231b"><a href="#footnote-231b">[2]</a></span>. What was Zhou Tiannan doing this for? To nauseate Chen Shi, or to find Tao Yueyue? Or, perhaps they’re brewing a scheme.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking about it, Chen Shi didn't have a good countermeasure. The topic changed. "It's okay, let's go to Wei Yi’s house to have a look!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After driving to Wei Yi's residence, Wei Yi opened the door, exposing two nervous eyes as he let them in. There was a smell of sandalwood in the dark room and there were a few yellow charms at the foot of the bed. Chen Shi asked, "Did you pray for these from the mountain?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I asked my friend to pray for the guardian spirit mantra from Wutai Mountain, as it’s said that it will make me sleep more peacefully."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Does it work?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It worked at first, but it gradually became useless. I still get the nightmares at night and feel like I have ants crawling on my body."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi looked at the house. The house of a man living alone was naturally messy. Unwashed clothes were thrown randomly on the sofa. On the table were leftover noodles and dumplings. There were many cigarette butts in the instant noodle bowl.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's a mess at home. Please sit down as you please!" Wei Yi cleaned up the sofa. He was only wearing a pair of boxer shorts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi reached out to him. "I'm sorry, I’m just testing your temperature." Then, he put his palm on Wei Yi’s forehead. Wei Yi's body temperature was normal, but Wei Yi screamed aloud. He ran to the sink to wash his forehead endlessly. Chen Shi asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You... Your hands are as hot as a soldering iron, sorry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let me check what you eat every day."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wei Yi asked him to wait a moment and took out instant noodles, frozen dumplings, instant buns, yogurt, and the like from the refrigerator. He said, "I don’t like takeaways and street stalls. I think they’re unhygienic. I ate in the cafeteria when I worked but now that I’m unemployed, I go to the supermarket to buy these things.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Apart from these? What do you drink?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Water, beer, yogurts."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let me see."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chen Shi inspected them with the naked eye and poured some into cups to smell. They were bought from supermarkets and there was nothing unusual. He asked Wei Yi if he often went out. Wei Yi shook his head. "I can't stand the heat outside. I usually just play games and watch TV at home. The thing I’m most afraid of is going to bed. I have nightmares as soon as I sleep."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you cover yourself with a blanket while you’re sleeping?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncovered. Just bare."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's a miracle that you haven’t caught a cold."</span></p>
