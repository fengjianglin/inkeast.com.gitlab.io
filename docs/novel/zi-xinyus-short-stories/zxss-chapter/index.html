 <p><strong>Prologue.</strong></p> 
 <p>A memory came to me in a flash; I remember that the god once asked me something like this.</p> 
 <p>“If I gave you the chance to become a human, would you want to?”</p> 
 <p>Back then, I simply smiled and said, “I don’t want to become a human. I want to continue being a bird, soaring freely in the skies. That’s perfect for me.”</p> 
 <p>As things changed with the passage of time, all of a sudden, I really wanted to become a human just once. Thus, I asked the god, “Can I still have another chance to become a human?”</p> 
 <p>However, the god shook his head, “You’ve already missed your opportunity. Furthermore, even if I gave you a chance now, you wouldn’t live past a single day.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s fine, even half a day is fine. I just want to be a human for once.” With shining eyes, I pleaded earnestly.</p> 
 <p>The god sighed, “Then I’ll give you a single day’s time. What are you going to do with it?”</p> 
 <p>I smiled, but stayed silent.</p> 
 <p>One day was enough.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 1.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was a little bird who was raised by a god.</p> 
 <p>I was born with the god’s divine blessings.</p> 
 <p>My feathers are a gorgeous sky blue, with traces of snowy white.</p> 
 <p>Thus, ever since I was born, I’ve been envied by most of my kind.</p> 
 <p>Because I could choose my own destiny, like that chance that the god gave me.</p> 
 <p>“If I gave you the chance to become a human, would you want to?”</p> 
 <p>I remember that I replied his question with one of my own.</p> 
 <p>“Is there any difference between humans and us birds?”</p> 
 <p>He smiled, “Of course there is. Humans have great intelligence, and they have great ability. That’s why all animals are afraid of them.”</p> 
 <p>I stared in astonishment for a moment, before asking, “Then what about birds?”</p> 
 <p>The god’s smile remained unchanging as he said, “Birds are simple, but they’re free.”</p> 
 <p>“Then I don’t want that chance, I just want to continue being a free bird.”</p> 
 <p>Back then, I had a pure nature. I just thought that if I were to become intelligent, then I would surely lose my wings.</p> 
 <p>Then why not be a carefree little bird?</p> 
 <p>I watched the god nod, seemingly in deep thought.</p> 
 <p>And since that time, I really became a happy little bird.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 2.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was a little bird who just learned how to fly.</p> 
 <p>From the side of a very kind god, I flew towards the forest for the first time.</p> 
 <p>He said that I belonged to nature.</p> 
 <p>Thus, he left.</p> 
 <p>When I first saw the sky, it was blue and really, really big.</p> 
 <p>I simply wanted to fly even higher and even further, and thus, I ended up flying really, really far.</p> 
 <p>I copied my fellow birds’ actions and landed on the balcony of a human.</p> 
 <p>They were stealing and eating the rice grains set out to dry in the sun. I also hid in a corner and sneakily ate the grains, mouthful by mouthful, feeling joy in eating my fill.</p> 
 <p>When night fell, I followed them and flew back to the forest.</p> 
 <p>When there was nothing to do, I learned how to catch little worms to eat, alongside my fellows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 3.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was a happy little bird.</p> 
 <p>The first time I saw a human, my companions and I were so scared that we flew really, really far away.</p> 
 <p>They said that humans are bad, that they would catch little birds to play with.</p> 
 <p>I was really scared.</p> 
 <p>Because I loved the blue skies, loved flying with my own wings, and loved my freedom.</p> 
 <p>But humans weren’t that bad.</p> 
 <p>I watched a little girl who had long, long hair; she was waving at me.</p> 
 <p>Dazed, I landed on a branch far away from her, out of her reach. I didn’t understand what she was doing.</p> 
 <p>She grabbed a bunch of rice grains and tossed them, and they landed not far from me.</p> 
 <p>She pointed there, smiling without saying a word.</p> 
 <p>That was a great, great temptation for me.</p> 
 <p>I wanted to eat those grains, but I was afraid that she would capture me.</p> 
 <p>I saw that my companions had all flown away, but the little girl still continued to smile as she watched me.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t move, as if waiting for me to move closer.</p> 
 <p>She hadn’t moved for a long, long while.</p> 
 <p>I thought, that maybe I could go over.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 4.</strong></p> 
 <p>Humans really are kind.</p> 
 <p>I carefully hopped a few steps forward, but she didn’t make a single move.</p> 
 <p>Thus, I scooped up a mouthful in my beak and flew away, but she still didn’t move.</p> 
 <p>I hopped forward again and ate a few mouthfuls while trembling in fear- she moved, making me fly off in panic.</p> 
 <p>However, I saw that she had thrown more rice over.</p> 
 <p>I stopped being scared, and after finishing all the grains on the ground, she still tossed another bunch of grains to me.</p> 
 <p>What a kind little girl.</p> 
 <p>She was the first human I met.</p> 
 <p>I thought, that humans were kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 5.</strong></p> 
 <p>After that, I would stop at that balcony every day.</p> 
 <p>When the little girl saw me, she would always toss me a handful of grains to eat.</p> 
 <p>Slowly, I lost my fear of her.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, I would even land very, very close to her.</p> 
 <p>She never tried to catch me.</p> 
 <p>When she watched me, she was always full of smiles.</p> 
 <p>Her body was tiny, compared to other humans. She wasn’t even as tall as another human’s legs.</p> 
 <p>She had a mother, and was always pulling at her mother’s pants, asking her to throw some food for me to eat.</p> 
 <p>I didn’t understand what they talked about.</p> 
 <p>I only knew that that girl would always give me something to eat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 6.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was a lazy little bird.</p> 
 <p>After I found someone to feed me everyday, I started to rely upon that little girl.</p> 
 <p>Although I could still find food on my own, I would always look for her from time to time.</p> 
 <p>She would give me plenty of grains to eat.</p> 
 <p>She would keep smiling at me, always.</p> 
 <p>As time passed, I got used to her.</p> 
 <p>I wasn’t afraid of her anymore.</p> 
 <p>I thought, that humans weren’t so scary after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 7.</strong></p> 
 <p>After that, I saw that little girl’s family carry many bags, big and small, out of their door.</p> 
 <p>After that, I never saw her again on that balcony.</p> 
 <p>My companions said that the little human had moved away.</p> 
 <p>I asked, “What do you mean by moving away?”</p> 
 <p>They said, “That means they’ll never come back.”</p> 
 <p>That made me feel terrible.</p> 
 <p>Was it because they had nothing left to eat after I ate all the grains in her home?</p> 
 <p>If humans didn’t have anything left to eat, did they have to go and catch worms to eat?</p> 
 <p>I felt guilty.</p> 
 <p>I was so afraid that the little girl would starve to death.</p> 
 <p>This wouldn’t do, I had to go find her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 8.</strong></p> 
 <p>I left home, left all my companions, and never saw the god again</p> 
 <p>I flew by myself towards the blue sky, and eventually came to a place called a city.</p> 
 <p>That place was very, very big. There were many humans, and the sky wasn’t as blue anymore.</p> 
 <p>There were very few trees there and a lot of black smoke, I couldn’t find anywhere to sleep.</p> 
 <p>I flew really, really far, and passed by many places.</p> 
 <p>But I never saw her again.</p> 
 <p>The kind little girl who fed me rice.</p> 
 <p>That wonderful home I yearned for.</p> 
 <p>I was surrounded by houses all around.</p> 
 <p>I lost my sense of direction, and my home.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 9.</strong></p> 
 <p>I saw a girl again, in the center of the city.</p> 
 <p>She tossed me a grain of rice, her eyes gleaming bright.</p> 
 <p>She was much taller than that girl, she must be a kind person as well.</p> 
 <p>I flew forward excitedly and landed on the ground. I started to eat the grains of rice.</p> 
 <p>However, she suddenly charged forth and it was too late for me to escape.</p> 
 <p>She grabbed onto my wings tightly, and I struggled with all my might.</p> 
 <p>I was hysterical; I shouted as loud as I could!</p> 
 <p>I pleaded for mercy, yet she burst out into laughter!</p> 
 <p>My wings hurt very much, and my feathers were dropping off.</p> 
 <p>I shrilled, I shrieked, and she held onto her stomach in laughter.</p> 
 <p>She was clearly much, much bigger than that little girl.</p> 
 <p>Why wasn’t she as kind as that little girl then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 10.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was locked into a cage and brought to her home.</p> 
 <p>She showed me off to other humans with a beaming smile.</p> 
 <p>And then, all the other humans laughed.</p> 
 <p>As if praising her.</p> 
 <p>I kept calling every day and night, asking her to release me.</p> 
 <p>However, she appeared to be leisurely and content, as if she were listening to a song.</p> 
 <p>I didn’t understand her language, and it seemed like she didn’t know that I was crying.</p> 
 <p>I was so hungry that my head was dizzy. I collapsed in the cage and stopped calling out.</p> 
 <p>She finally gave me food, but it was something I didn’t like.</p> 
 <p>Black and yellow little specks, was that what the birds in the city ate?</p> 
 <p>But I wanted to eat rice grains.</p> 
 <p>I missed the little girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 11.</strong></p> 
 <p>She finally threw me out of the cage and locked another little bird in there.</p> 
 <p>I watched that bird cry incessantly, struggling with all his life.</p> 
 <p>He was saying, “Save me, save me…”</p> 
 <p>I spoke to him weakly, telling him to play dead. Play dead.</p> 
 <p>He pretended to die.</p> 
 <p>But I was probably dying for real.</p> 
 <p>So humans were actually so cruel.</p> 
 <p>They would lock you up under the pretense of taking care of you.</p> 
 <p>Torturing you until you died.</p> 
 <p>I was thrown out the window, and I landed on the ground below.</p> 
 <p>I looked at the wide, blue sky above and those free birds.</p> 
 <p>I watched a group of little birds flying past above me.</p> 
 <p>They were chittering and chattering, seemingly unhappy. Upon spotting me, they were extremely shocked.</p> 
 <p>“Look there! Look there!”</p> 
 <p>“That little bird is crying…”</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 12.</strong></p> 
 <p>I was picked up and brought to another home.</p> 
 <p>That girl petted my feathers with her eyes agleam.</p> 
 <p>She seemed to like my feathers very much; she picked up a pair of scissors.</p> 
 <p>Then she cut off my feathers, one by one, and arranged them in the shape of a beautiful flower.</p> 
 <p>She placed the flower by the window. What a dazzling sight.</p> 
 <p>Plucked of my feathers, I finally closed my eyes slowly.</p> 
 <p>Why was it that the size of the humans was equal to the amount of evil in their hearts?</p> 
 <p>Why was it that the smaller the human, the more good they had in their hearts?</p> 
 <p>What a pity that I only realised it now.</p> 
 <p>What a pity, that I didn’t even have any strength left to speak…</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 13.</strong></p> 
 <p>I met the god again, in the instant I was about to die.</p> 
 <p>He only shook his head and held me in his hands.</p> 
 <p>“Why can’t you differentiate between good and evil?”</p> 
 <p>I spoke up weakly, “Why are humans differentiated by good and evil?”</p> 
 <p>However, he smiled and said, “If you were a human, living in that kind of environment, you might not turn out to be a good person yourself.”</p> 
 <p>I fell into melancholy and pain, tears filling my eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Can I have another chance, to become a human?”</p> 
 <p>However, the god shook his head, “You’ve already missed your opportunity. Furthermore, even if I gave you a chance now, you wouldn’t live past a single day.”</p> 
 <p>With my eyes full of tears, I said, “That’s fine, even half a day is fine. I just want to be a human for once.”</p> 
 <p>The god sighed, “Then I’ll give you a single day’s time. What are you going to do with it?”</p> 
 <p>I smiled, but stayed silent.</p> 
 <p>One day was enough.</p> 
 <p><strong>Part 14.</strong></p> 
 <p>Finally.</p> 
 <p>I was sent to that little girl.</p> 
 <p>In the form of a human.</p> 
 <p>For the first time, I understood what she was saying.</p> 
 <p>While she was in the big city, she still loved birds as before.</p> 
 <p>She stood on a brand new balcony, with two little birds as her companions as before.</p> 
 <p>That day, I stood in front of her.</p> 
 <p>I didn’t say a single word to her.</p> 
 <p>I only picked up some stones and purposely threw them.</p> 
 <p>Not a single one of them hit the little birds.</p> 
 <p>However, all the little birds she was feeding flew away.</p> 
 <p>The birds were panicked and fearful, and not a single one remained.</p> 
 <p>The little girl burst into tears and asked what I was doing!</p> 
 <p>I smiled and spoke for the first time.</p> 
 <p>I left that one sentence.</p> 
 <p>“I’m afraid that they’ll think that all humans are good in the future.”</p>
