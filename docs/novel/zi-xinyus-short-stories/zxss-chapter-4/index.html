<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>I once asked myself whether I had ever experienced anything… so unforgettable that it was carved deeply into my bones.</p> 
 <p>Then I thought carefully about it.</p> 
 <p>Actually, my life was pretty average and rather peaceful.</p> 
 <p>It was probably because I was still young.</p> 
 <p>But upon thinking even more seriously, it seems like I’ve ever really hated one person.</p> 
 <h2 id="my-mum">My mum.</h2> 
 <p>I was four years old back then.</p> 
 <p>Blame it on my age and my fuzzy memory; I didn’t even manage to remember what my dad looked like even after he passed away.</p> 
 <p>I could only remember some bits and pieces.</p> 
 <p>The dad in my memories was a very, very fierce man.</p> 
 <p>He would use something like a bamboo stick and beat me until I was rolling on the floor in agony.</p> 
 <p>When I was being disobedient, he would tie me to a stool and wouldn’t let anyone let me go.</p> 
 <p>He would always buy those cheap books that cost 20 cents for me, and order me to write on it from cover to cover.</p> 
 <p>All he did was make me cry and act out; I really didn’t know what to think of him.</p> 
 <p>I just thought that other dads would beat their children as well.</p> 
 <p>However, their mums would surely help to deflect some of it.</p> 
 <p>While my mum was always watching from afar.</p> 
 <h2 id="thus-i-started-to-hate-her">Thus, I started to hate her.</h2> 
 <p>The year I turned seven.</p> 
 <p>Three years after my dad passed away, she still remained a widow.</p> 
 <p>All alone, she raised me and my brother, who was two years younger.</p> 
 <p>She always said that I failed to live up to expectations.</p> 
 <p>I would fall sick often and would take very long to recover, so she had to run all over the place looking for a doctor.</p> 
 <p>She probably ran out of money then.</p> 
 <p>Thus, she almost kneeled in front of my grandfather, my dad’s father.</p> 
 <p>My grandfather gave her a hundred dollars and told her to repay it later on.</p> 
 <p>Friends and relatives hid from us, not caring if we lived or not.</p> 
 <p>I was young and ignorant back then.</p> 
 <p>I always felt that other people’s mums had a lot of money.</p> 
 <p>But my mum was so poor that she had to borrow money from everywhere.</p> 
 <h2 id="thus-i-hated-her">Thus, I hated her.</h2> 
 <p>Perhaps it was when I was ten.</p> 
 <p>The new teacher at school was recording something.</p> 
 <p>The teacher just had to ask about our dads’ names.</p> 
 <p>Back then, I didn’t know that I could fill in my mum’s name instead, so I didn’t know what to do.</p> 
 <p>Thus the teacher asked, “How do you not even know what your own dad is called?”</p> 
 <p>I flushed red; then I heard a girl from the same village shout, “She doesn’t have a dad!”</p> 
 <p>In an instant, all the kids in the class were bursting out in laughter.</p> 
 <p>I saw the teacher’s guilty expression.</p> 
 <p>However, I was the one who lowered my head and cried for an entire year.</p> 
 <p>It was all my mum’s fault for never mentioning what my dad was called.</p> 
 <p>Mum, I really hate you.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>There was a year when I seemed to be waiting for something in school.</p> 
 <p>It was probably after classes; the rain was pouring heavily and many of my classmates had forgotten to bring umbrellas.</p> 
 <p>I was about twelve years old then, and I kept watching the other kids get picked up by someone bringing an umbrella.</p> 
 <p>I kept waiting and waiting, but no one came.</p> 
 <p>Other kids had young, pretty and rich mums, and they looked so clean.</p> 
 <p>Jealousy filled me as I watched from the side.</p> 
 <p>However, it wasn’t until almost everyone had left that my mum finally came over eagerly with an umbrella. She was so old, so ugly, and she was so dirty all over.</p> 
 <p>Everyone thought my grandmother had come to fetch me.</p> 
 <p>The young me was worried about losing face, so I lowered my head and walked as far away from her as I could.</p> 
 <p>But she hurriedly rushed up, held the umbrella up over me and apologised.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong? Are you angry? I didn’t intend to arrive this late. I was rushing and accidentally fell…”</p> 
 <p>I saw that her arm was bleeding.</p> 
 <p>What a clumsy mum.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-hate-you-so-much-just-die">I hate you so much, just die.</h2> 
 <p>When my maternal grandfather died, I was about fourteen.</p> 
 <p>I hid under the table and cried myself silly.</p> 
 <p>My younger brother cried for days, while my older cousin knelt in front of the corpse and my aunts rushed back and forth.</p> 
 <p>Thus, I hid under the table for an entire day.</p> 
 <p>When I was found, my aunt said, “Child, why are you hiding over here? Go and comfort your mum, she’s been crying for really long and no one’s managed to console her.”</p> 
 <p>I crawled out shakily and went downstairs.</p> 
 <p>Only to see that while there were both happy and sad faces around, she had cried until she had collapsed to the floor. She rolled back and forth, like a child throwing a tantrum.</p> 
 <p>When my grandfather was moved to the hearse, her agitated emotions turned into full blown hysteria.</p> 
 <p>Everyone was crying, but we were still standing.</p> 
 <p>How could she just lie on the floor just like that?</p> 
 <p>What a loss of face; she seemed so childish.</p> 
 <h2 id="my-stupid-mum-was-so-annoying">My stupid mum was so annoying.</h2> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, a few years passed and I turned sixteen.</p> 
 <p>I was young, rebellious and full of ignorance.</p> 
 <p>Mum was getting older, but I was in the peak of my youth.</p> 
 <p>Thus I quarrelled with her everyday, day and night.</p> 
 <p>I loathed her blind worry and nagging, so I started to return home late and mix with all sorts of scoundrels.</p> 
 <p>She tried to keep me on a tight leash.</p> 
 <p>Calls would come day and night, persuading me to go home.</p> 
 <p>I left in a fit of pique.</p> 
 <p>3am in the early morning.</p> 
 <p>When I opened the door.</p> 
 <p>I saw her sitting by the entrance holding a wooden stool.</p> 
 <p>“You’re home?”</p> 
 <p>My mum.</p> 
 <p>She controlled me so strictly, tying me to her everyday.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-really-hate-you">I really hate you.</h2> 
 <p>I was prone to causing trouble when I was young; the next incident I remember was when I was eighteen.</p> 
 <p>I had bought two romantic fiction books and had been reading happily.</p> 
 <p>When she saw it, she immediately took the books and tore them into pieces.</p> 
 <p>Thus I cried and made a fuss like I had never grown up.</p> 
 <p>She then said that she had raised me up in the hopes that I would study properly, that I shouldn’t read these kinds of romantic stories, that I would become silly from them.</p> 
 <p>I scolded her for being unfair, that she wouldn’t let me do anything at all.</p> 
 <p>Why was it that my younger brother was allowed to do anything he wanted?</p> 
 <p>I asked if she was being biased.</p> 
 <p>I had always been stubborn as an ox since I was young; after this one fight, I went on a hunger strike for a few days.</p> 
 <p>She had a soft personality and she was a crybaby.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that I wasn’t eating or drinking, she got anxious.</p> 
 <p>I’ll remember what happened for the rest of my life.</p> 
 <p>In other people’s families, daughters would kneel before their mothers.</p> 
 <p>My mum knelt before me; see what an unfilial daughter I am.</p> 
 <p>Mum, you’re always acting like this.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-really-hate-you-1">I really hate you.</h2> 
 <p>When I was around twenty one years old, I realised that half of the hair on her head was white.</p> 
 <p>I went out into society and started working, heh.</p> 
 <p>It was only then that I realised how hard it was to earn money. Thinking back on the years where I disdained her for being poor, I went to the marketplace and bought pyjamas for her, sending them straight to her.</p> 
 <p>Her happiness from receiving the first ever present from me lasted a few years.</p> 
 <p>She would always boast outside that her daughter was so filial.</p> 
 <p>She would talk about how her daughter loved her so.</p> 
 <p>She was great at deceiving herself.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-really-hated-her">I really hated her.</h2> 
 <p>When I was twenty five, I started to date someone.</p> 
 <p>She looked him up and down and asked around about his family and background before she could rest easy.</p> 
 <p>Before she dared to hand me over to him.</p> 
 <p>When I visited his home, that was when I finally realised what home truly was.</p> 
 <p>Thus, I dipped into my memories once again, and remembered how I thought her ugly back then.</p> 
 <p>I bought some makeup products.</p> 
 <p>Placed them into her hands.</p> 
 <p>Only to see that her hair had all turned white.</p> 
 <h2 id="actually-i-don’t-really-hate-her-that-much">Actually, I don’t really hate her that much.</h2> 
 <p>At thirty years old, I no longer dared to look back on my memories. I didn’t dare to look at her, nor did I dare to think about them.</p> 
 <p>I have a daughter now, and as I was watching her sleep soundly, it was then that I finally understood what my mum felt for me.</p> 
 <p>So this was how it felt.</p> 
 <p>Maternal love, what exactly are you?</p> 
 <p>She’s already sixty this year. Her hair is white and her teeth are gone.</p> 
 <p>However, when she looks at me, she still beams.</p> 
 <p>People started ignoring her when she walked on the streets, and our family started to get irritated by her when she was at home.</p> 
 <p>But I found that…</p> 
 <h2 id="actually-she’s-not-that-annoying-after-all">Actually, she’s not that annoying after all.</h2> 
 <p>At thirty five, I started accompanying her more often.</p> 
 <p>Only to see her hearing get worse and worse; I have to repeat myself a few times for every sentence I speak.</p> 
 <p>The bad habits she used to have haven’t changed a bit. When I look a little haggard, she starts crying without warning.</p> 
 <p>I kept telling her to treat herself better, to treat her body better.</p> 
 <p>But she said, “Ah? I’ve already eaten. Have you eaten yet?”</p> 
 <p>I said, “Take care of yourself, don’t tire yourself out.”</p> 
 <p>She said, “What? You want me to cook noodles? Alright, alright…”</p> 
 <p>I watched her slowly move her body.</p> 
 <p>She started to get busy in the kitchen.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a tear dripped from my eyes.</p> 
 <p>Actually, I don’t hate her anymore.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-only-hope-that-she-can-make-it-to-her-hundredth-birthday">I only hope that she can make it to her hundredth birthday.</h2> 
 <p>My prediction was pretty accurate; she made it to a hundred and one.</p> 
 <p>I was already white-haired by then.</p> 
 <p>My daughter was disobedient, and my son made a ruckus.</p> 
 <p>It was only then that I realised how tough she had it back in those years.</p> 
 <p>But my husband is still around and my family is happy.</p> 
 <p>My mum back then…</p> 
 <p>She was bringing up two kids alone!</p> 
 <p>As I watched that coffin descending slowly down into the earth, tears streamed down my cheeks in the midst of my hysteria.</p> 
 <p>That bout of crying.</p> 
 <p>It was as if my heart was being ripped apart; I was so agitated that I started rolling around on the ground.</p> 
 <p>I was unwilling, I refused to accept reality; I couldn’t bear it at all.</p> 
 <p>I acted the same way I did when my dad beat me as a child.</p> 
 <p>The same way she had rolled about when my grandfather had been buried.</p> 
 <p>I cried, I made a ruckus.</p> 
 <p>In that instant, I realised.</p> 
 <p>Mum, I like you so much.</p> 
 <p>I really, really like you.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-really-really-love-you">I really, really love you.</h2> 
 <p>My mum.</p> 
 <p>She drifted through life for my sake, and tasted all sorts of suffering in this world for me.</p> 
 <p>When she ate meals outside, she would always bring a bag so she could bring back tasty treats in secret.</p> 
 <p>I would always be looking at the biscuit in the hands of the kid next door.</p> 
 <p>She would go out to buy one in secret and watch me eat it with a broad smile.</p> 
 <p>I was too frivolous when I was young.</p> 
 <p>I never realised how tough she had it without her husband.</p> 
 <p>I only knew how hard it was for me without my dad.</p> 
 <p>But I forgot that she was raising two children without her husband by her side!</p> 
 <p>Mum, I used to hate you.</p> 
 <p>But now, you’ve disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p> 
 <p>I really want to see you.</p> 
 <p>I want to tell you everything I’ve kept in my heart.</p> 
 <p>Actually.</p> 
 <p>I like…</p> 
 <p>Did you know, that I really like you?</p> 
 <p>I’m not good with words at all.</p> 
 <p>Were you hurt by me?</p> 
 <p>Now, when my daughter writes compositions, she fills the book from cover to cover.</p> 
 <p>Now, the 30 cents biscuits I used to eat cost a dollar.</p> 
 <p>But it still tastes the same.</p> 
 <p>Like the one you bought back then.</p> 
 <p>Why do I…</p> 
 <h2 id="suddenly-want-to-see-you-so-bad">Suddenly want to see you so bad?</h2> 
 <p>My life was average.</p> 
 <p>I never experienced any great pain or suffering, and never went through anything earth-shattering.</p> 
 <p>I’ve only hated one person in my life.</p> 
 <p>I’ve only liked that one person in my life.</p> 
 <p>My mum.</p> 
 <p>There’s so much suffering in this world.</p> 
 <p>It’s fine.</p> 
 <p>Wait a few more years, and I’ll come chasing after you.</p> 
 <p>When the time comes.</p> 
 <h2 id="i-want-to-call-out-to-you-again-mum">I want to call out to you again, Mum.</h2> 
 <p>I finally became a grandmother; my daughter gave birth to a child.</p> 
 <p>I watched her grow more thoughtful, and she started to do the laundry and cook for me.</p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, three years passed and I carried my grandson with me happily.</p> 
 <p>My hearing was starting to worsen, and my daughter’s voice was starting to become unclear.</p> 
 <p>I would shut my eyes occasionally.</p> 
 <p>And see my mum.</p> 
 <p>She’s waiting for me in my dreams.</p> 
 <p>In the end.</p> 
 <p>After thinking about it carefully.</p> 
 <p>Mum.</p> 
 <p>I seem to have owed you something.</p> 
 <p>Actually, I love you so much.</p> 
 <h2 id="and-i’m-sorry">And, I’m sorry.</h2>
