 <p><strong>Chapter 364: Sneak Attack</strong></p>
 <p>Within the huge cavern, dazzling radiance from the treasures swarmed from every directions, putting up a magnificent display. An ordinary person who stepped foot upon this place would not want to leave. Anything taken from here would be considered an expensive treasure in the outside world. As such, it goes to shown how powerful and strong the Lin Clan’s foundation was. The Lin Clan was fully deserving to be one of the four great clans.</p>
 <p>However, Lin Dong lost interest after having a rough glimpse of the radiance from those treasures, and continued on the path towards the depths of the clan trove without stopping.</p>
 <p>The area of the clan trove was reasonably huge. It took Lin Dong half an hour of wandering before reaching the deeper region.</p>
 <p>The deeper region of the clan trove had a totally different environment from the exterior. There were multiple rays of brilliance outlining paths of light and at the end of each path, there was a stone altar, which was engulfed by a glowing radiance. Floating atop those stone altars were various kinds of powerful Soul Treasures, elixirs, martial arts and etc...</p>
 <p>As he reached the deeper region, Lin Dong discovered that the concentration of Yuan Power there had reached a terrifying level. Some of the Yuan Power had begun to congregate into thin clouds, which shocked Lin Dong. He glanced around and noticed that there seemed to be several small holes on the ground and surroundings. The high concentration of Yuan Power in the area was caused by these small holes, which were constantly producing these Yuan Power.</p>
 <p>“Beneath the clan trove, there is a tremendously huge formation, which is constantly absorbing Yuan Power from the Heaven and Earth, and pumping them into this area. These Yuan Power are then used to nurture these treasures,” Little Marten’s voice echoed in Lin Dong’s mind. It appeared for a short while before returning to the stone talisman as it was afraid that there might be magical surveillance in this area.</p>
 <p>“There seems to be traces of pure Yuan Pills in these Yuan Power,” Lin Dong exclaimed shockingly as he took in two breath of the cloud-like Yuan Power.</p>
 <p>“It seems that for the sake of this clan trove, the Lin Clan has put in a lot of effort. Just absorbing the Yuan Power from Heaven and Earth alone would not sustain this level of concentration of Yuan Power. It seems that this formation needs to be fed with large supply of pure Yuan Pills…” Lin Dong tsked and shook his head. His eyes were filled with astonishment. Only a powerhouse like the Lin Clan was able to pull off such a stunt.</p>
 <p>“No wonder Elder Lin Mu wants me to make full use of the opportunity. After obtaining the Soul Treasure, I will train here and see if I can take advantage of the concentrated Yuan Power here to break through to initial Manifestation Stage.”</p>
 <p>After this thought came up in his mind briefly, Lin Dong moved his feet once more and followed the path of light.</p>
 <p>At this moment, on both sides of Lin Dong, there were smaller paths of light extending from the one he was standing on. At the end of these smaller paths, there were various treasures. However, Lin Dong lost interest after a mere glance. Right now, he was only enticed by the Earthly Soul Treasures. As for the Lin clan’s martial arts and even Manifestation martial arts, he had not a bit of interest in them.</p>
 <p>After all, Manifestation martial arts could be classified as low, average or high. The clan Manifestation martial art “Great Heavenly Phoenix Seal” that Lin Langtian displayed the other day was at most a low grade Manifestation martial art. Meanwhile, according to his conjecture, Lin Dong’s “Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Finger”, would be a high grade Manifestation martial art if he could truly master it. By then, every movement he made would be an earth-shattering one.</p>
 <p>Therefore, even though Lin Dong came across a few powerful Lin Clan martial arts on the path of light, he never lingered and continued walking on. After approximately ten minutes, the path ahead suddenly expanded before a huge canopy of light appeared in front of Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong stopped before the canopy of light and fixed his gaze tightly upon it. Within the canopy, he could see four floating, glowing light orbs and each orb was emitting an extremely strong energy waves. These energy waves were filled with spiritual power. Apparently, these were the Earthly Soul Treasures which Lin Dong had been yearning even in his dreams!</p>
 <p>“Lin Clan is indeed worthy of its reputation. Four Earthly Soul Treasures!” Lin Dong’s eyes were blazing with fire as he looked at the four light orbs in the canopy of light. If he were to obtain one of the them, his fighting capabilities would increase dramatically.</p>
 <p>“Be careful, Lin Dong. Many formations have been set up around here and their energy fluctuations are pretty strong,” Little Marten’s voice suddenly echoed in Lin Dong’s mind as his eyes glimmered.</p>
 <p>“Ok.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong nodded his head. He could sense that a lot of formations have been placed around the canopy of light. Conventionally, formations were used for defensive purposes and would not attack him. However, Lin Zhi was in charge of the clan trove and he belonged to the same faction as Lin Langtian. Because of this fact, Lin Dong had no choice but to be more careful.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s footsteps stopped outside the canopy of light. He then muttered to himself for a moment before putting his foot out slowly. The Yuan Power in his body began to engage rapidly, preparing him for any abrupt circumstances.</p>
 <p>The event he foresaw did not occur. The formations that surrounded the canopy of light continued to float peacefully without any activities. However, there was a strong restricting force emanating from the space in front of the canopy, as if it was trying to push Lin Dong away.</p>
 <p>These restrictive forces appeared to be coming from the four Soul Treasures inside the canopy of light and their combined force did not lose out to an advanced Manifestation practitioner. However, this pressure posed little obstacle to Lin Dong. His footsteps remained steady as he slowly walked across that glowing canopy and approached the four glowing orbs.</p>
 <p>“Buzz! Buzz!”</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong stepped closer, the four light orbs released a weird buzzing sound as if they sensed something. The restricting force suddenly intensified and pushed back Lin Dong, forcing him to take a step back.</p>
 <p>“These are indeed Earthly Soul Treasures,” Instead of feeling angry, Lin Dong was overjoyed upon witnessing what had happened. The harder these Soul Treasures resisted, the more powerful they were.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, these are just Soul Treasures,” Lin Dong laughed in his heart. Suddenly, his body jolted and a wave of scorching heat rose through it, dissipating the strong restrictive force in the process. Lin Dong then took a few strides and broke through the canopy of light thoroughly.</p>
 <p>In a flash, Lin Dong was right in front of the four light orbs.</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>Just as Lin Dong broke through the canopy of light, suddenly, a soft snapping sound broke out. At that moment, Lin Dong’s facial expression changed and he turned around abruptly. What he saw was the previously floating formations were now activated and firmly trapped him together within the canopy of light, as if it were some kind of jail.</p>
 <p>“Sure enough, that old fogey is trying to harm me!” An icy cold glint gushed into Lin Dong’s eyes when he witnessed what had just happened. He then raised his head and scanned the surroundings. He knew that Lin Zhi was able to observe the scene ongoing now.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom!”</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong was scanning the surroundings, the formations around him suddenly let out a muffled roar, followed by a burst of light. More than ten beams of intense light shot out violently from the formations and directed themselves at the vital parts of Lin Dong’s body.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing these incoming light beams, Lin Dong’s face remained ice-cold instead and it seemed like he had no intentions of dodging them. Lin Dong then released a powerful punch, which was accompanied by violent gale, and completely ripped through every incoming light beams.</p>
 <p>In the meantime, while Lin Dong was being attacked by the formations, the elders stationed at the pavilion outside of the clan trove, were looking indifferently at a light screen in front of them. The light screen was showing exactly what was going on in the clan trove. The scene of Lin Dong’s retaliation was captured by it too.</p>
 <p>“Let’s work together and control the formations to kill him!” Lin Zhi sneered ghastly while looking at the light screen.</p>
 <p>“As long as the four of us work together, we can put up a fight even if it is against a practitioner who had reached the peak of the Manifestation Stage. Even if Lin Dong has a lot of tricks up his sleeves, he will not escape today!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah!”</p>
 <p>Hearing what was said, the three elders nodded their heads solemnly. Shortly after they worked together, their hand-seals began to change irregularly. Four beams of light shot out from their hands into the light screen as they began to control the formations in the dark.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!”</p>
 <p>As four of them combined their powers, a terrifying shock wave broke out in the clan trove, setting off numerous arrays. Immediately, Lin Dong felt a huge restricting force sweeping from every directions. Immediately, his eyes sunk. The reason why Lin Zhi dared to attack him was naturally because he was very confident of his own abilities. Based on their combined abilities, in addition to the formations, even he would find it tough to deal with him. In fact, if he was negligent, he might actually perish.</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong, do you see the light screen on the top of the cavern? That must be the focal point where they control the formations. As long as that focal point is destroyed, they will lose the ability to control the formations. Otherwise, with the huge number of formations here and the constant waves of attacks, you will be slowly drained to death!” Little Marten’s voice rang urgently through Lin Dong’s mind as the latter was deflecting the light beams coming at him from all directions.</p>
 <p>After he heard what was said, Lin Dong raised his head abruptly. Indeed, he saw a dazzling radiance floating at the top of the cavern. Meanwhile, waves of telepathic thoughts emitted faintly from that area.</p>
 <p>“These old fogeys!”</p>
 <p>A cold glint rushed into Lin Dong’s eyes. The focal point was protected by numerous powerful formations and it was not easy to destroy it in one go. Besides, Lin Zhi and his counterparts would do their best to prevent it from being destroyed. They even hoped that Lin Dong would attack that strongest area, thereby making it easier for them to kill him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t waste your energy on them. The more formations activated, the stronger their powers will be!” Little Marten reminded.</p>
 <p>“Ok.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong nodded his head with a smirk on his face. Since these fogeys were so irritating, then don’t blame him for being vicious and merciless.</p>
 <p>As this thought flashed across his mind, Lin Dong changed his hand-seal. Suddenly, a strong and ruthless killing aura rushed out from Lin Dong’s Qiankun bag with an extreme speed.</p>
 <p>This killing aura was especially violent. Upon appearing, it caused the surrounding Yuan Power to fluctuate vigorously. Without waiting for anyone to react, a streak of blood gushed out with a terrifying speed.</p>
 <p>“Bang! Bang!”</p>
 <p>Almost nobody could see the speed of that bloody glow. As the bloody glow flew through the air, the formations shrouding the focal point exploded without any resistance. The bloody glow then attacked the light screen ruthlessly. With a single strike, the light screen exploded. Under such a powerful and precise attack, Lin Zhi and his counterparts lost total contact with the clan trove without any chances to react.</p>
 <p>“Cough! Vomit”</p>
 <p>In the pavilion, the light screen blew up from that particular strike. Lin Zhi and his counterparts’ faces were pale white. Soon after, they spat out a mouthful of blood violently while their eyes were wide with horror.</p>
