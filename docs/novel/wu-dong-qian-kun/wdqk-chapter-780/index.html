 <p><strong>Chapter 780: Confirmation</strong></p>
 <p>Sha sha.</p>
 <p>The Yuan Cang trio slowly appeared from the other side of the altar. In the end, they stopped some distance away from Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Yuan Cang’s face was indifferent. Only when he saw Ling Qingzhu beside Lin Dong, did a faint disturbance appear in his eyes. However, soon after, his eyes turned increasingly dark and solemn as he stared at Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong, it seems like even the heavens do not wish to give you an easy time. How long has it been? To think that you have actually sent yourself directly to our doorstep.” Little Thunder King Lei Qian’s gaze was filled with bitter resentment as he stared at Lin Dong. His expression was still a little pale, however, it was much better than before. Clearly, he had brought along some extremely effective healing medicine.</p>
 <p>Little Spirit King Ling Zhen gaze was also a little ominous as he stared at Lin Dong. The foldable fan in his hand shook gently. Overall, he looked as though he had come with ill intent.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong stared at the Yuan Cang trio as his expression turned a little ugly. Clearly, he had not expected to actually encounter them here. This was definitely not an ideal situation for him. If the Yuan Cang trio were to join forces, it would definitely be very difficult…</p>
 <p>“Your ability to locate this place has truly taken me by surprise…” Yuan Cang looked at Lin Dong. He did not attack immediately. Instead, he merely spoke in an indifferent voice.</p>
 <p>They were able to reach this place quickly because they held quite a lot of information related to the Burning Sky Ancient Stash. However, Yuan Cang did not expect that Lin Dong would actually reach this place soon after they arrived…</p>
 <p>“This is where the central hub that controls this formation is located, right?” Lin Dong shrugged. His gaze turned towards that large stone altar as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes narrowed slightly as he sized up the large stone altar. His finger involuntarily drew past his palm. He could sense that the stone talisman within his body was emitting a strange fluctuation at this moment…</p>
 <p>“This altar…”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong lifted his head and his gaze turned towards the sky above the altar. The space there appeared to be bright red in colour. His eyes flickered as though he sensed something.</p>
 <p>“Qingzhu, how are you?”</p>
 <p>While Lin Dong was observing the area, Yuan Cang’s eyes turned towards Ling Qingzhu as a gentle smile surfaced on his face. Though he was not very handsome, his face had a unique taste to it. When he smiled, it gave one a refreshing feeling.</p>
 <p>Ling Qingzhu inclined her head. She glancd at Lin Dong beside her and said, “Does senior brother Yuan Cang know where we are now?”</p>
 <p>“This is the Burning Sky Array of the Burning Sky Ancient Stash. It is the guardian of the ancient stash. Everyone who enters the ancient stash will fall into this Burning Sky Array. Haha. However, this Burning Sky Array has yet to be activated. Otherwise, even we would not be able to reach this place.” Yuan Cang spoke smilingly.</p>
 <p>“Burning Sky Array…”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes focused slightly. This formation was already so powerful before it had been activated? What if it was activated? Just how powerful would it be then?</p>
 <p>“Currently, everyone who entered the Burning Sky Ancient Stash has been trapped in this Burning Sky Array. Don’t worry, Qingzhu. After I take control of the formation, I will ensure that the disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace will not face any harm.” Yuan Cang laughed.</p>
 <p>“Of course, some creatures that do not know how to appreciate kindness will likely be burnt into ashes in this Burning Sky Array…” Lei Qian laughed sinisterly.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s expression immediately turned dark and cold when he heard these words. His eyes were maliciously dark as he stared at Yuan Cang trio and said, “If anything happens to my Dao Sect disciples, I’m afraid that your Yuan Gate disciples can forget about walking out of this Unique Devil Region alive!”</p>
 <p>“Such arrogant words. Even Zhou Tong back then wasn’t as arrogant as you. Just who do you think you are!” Ling Zhen’s eyes turned cold as he laughed chillingly.</p>
 <p>“It is unexpected that you still have the courage to utter such haughty words at this moment… don’t tell me that you think that the current you actually possesses the qualifications to behave in such an arrogant fashion?” A cold smile also surfaced on Yuan Cang’s face as he stared at Lin Dong and mocked.</p>
 <p>“Boss, let’s finish off this brat here to prevent any further troubles.” Lei Qian laughed sinisterly. His eyes were filled with bitterness and resentment.</p>
 <p>A chill flickered within Yuan Cang’s eyes. Immediately, he nodded slightly. Now that Lin Dong had coincidentally landed in their laps, it was the best opportunity for them to finish him off.</p>
 <p>Killing intent surged within Lei Qian and Ling Zhen’s eyes when they saw Yuan Cang nod. Their bodies immediately moved and formed a semicircle formation, surrounding Lin Dong in the process. From the looks of it, they intended to join hands and swiftly finish off Lin Dong...</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s expression sunk slightly as he watched this scene, while the Yuan Power within his body began to circulate. With his current strength, a battle against Lei Qian alone was already difficult. Now that the three little kings of Yuan Gate were going to join forces, regardless of how much confidence he had, he knew that this was not going to be easy.</p>
 <p>The Yuan Cang trio floated up in the air. An unusually majestic Yuan Power fluctuation slowly swept out as a heavy pressure covered Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong waved his hand and a demon corpse appeared in front of him. Now that it came to this, it was likely that he had to use his various trump cards...</p>
 <p>Just as Lin Dong took out his demon corpse and prepared to engage in a massive fight with the three little kings, a fragrant breeze blew from behind him. He was stunned to see Ling Qingzhu suddenly move to stand in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Qingzhu? What does this mean?” Yuan Cang demanded in a deep voice. His eyes changed when he saw Ling Qingzhu standing in front of Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother Yuan Cang, the reason I was able to come to this place is because Lin Dong was leading the way, hence, I owe him a favor. Therefore, if you wish to attack him now, I am afraid that I will not idly stand by.” Ling Qingzhu’s veil trembled slightly. Her cool voice appeared to have suppressed even the heat of this place.</p>
 <p>When that alluring voice was transmitted into Lin Dong’s ears, even he was stunned. Clearly, he did not expect that Ling Qingzhu would actually voluntarily step forward. Moreover, her reason for helping him clearly did not possess much conviction. This was because Lin Dong still owed her from five years ago…</p>
 <p>Yuan Cang’s expression gradually turned unusually dark and solemn. There appeared to be a thunderbolt of fury surging deep within his eyes. Ling Qingzhu had actually stepped forward to protect Lin Dong. This clearly was a blow to his usually indifferent self…</p>
 <p>Ling Zhen and Lei Qian also glanced at Yuan Cang at this moment. They were clearly aware that the latter fancied Ling Qingzhu. Although there was no progress between the two of them during these two years, Yuan Cang undoubtedly saw Ling Qingzhu as his woman. Yet, Ling Qingzhu had stepped forward to protect Lin Dong…</p>
 <p>The two of them exchanged glances before they chuckled coldly. They knew that it might still be alright if Ling Qingzhu did not step forward. Now that she did, it was likely that Yuan Cang would definitely kill Lin Dong…</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong, are you going to hide behind a woman?” Yuan Cang stared at Lin Dong in a dark and solemn manner as he slowly said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes were a little dark. He sighed softly a moment later before he slowly walked past Ling Qingzhu.</p>
 <p>Ling Qingzhu knitted her brows slightly as she watched Lin Dong walk past her. She spoke in a faint voice, “After these five years of training, you should understand the importance of survival even more than I do. Trying to act tough for a moment may salvage your pride, but from the way I see it, it is extremely short sighted. It is likely that I will have to withdraw the complement I gave you previously.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s footsteps paused. He silently contemplated for a moment before turning around. As he looked at the veiled face, which could cause the downfall of a country, he smilingly replied, “Didn’t you ask me how I was able to reach such a place in merely five years? The answer is very simple. It was because I told myself back then I will only allow a woman to save me once in my life…”</p>
 <p>“Additionally, I do not like to act tough. I know how powerful the three of them are. However… you should also know that the current me is also no longer that weak fellow from five years ago…”</p>
 <p>“If they want to kill me, the price to pay will be so expensive that they will not be able to afford it…”</p>
 <p>Ling Qingzhu gazed at the young man as a grin appeared on his face. Her pearly white teeth gently bit her lips. The young man from back then was petty and weak. When faced a Ling Langtian he could not contend against, he chose to swallow his pride and endure humiliation. Ultimately however, he let reality tell those people that the one who had the final laugh, was the one who was the most successful…</p>
 <p>The reason why she showed compassion to Lin Dong and gave up on killing this young man, who had disgraced her, was not because she had discovered a stunning potential within him. Neither was it because of pity. The biggest reason was because of the tolerance that this young man displayed when he was unable to contend against Lin Langtian.</p>
 <p>She could see Lin Dong’s current success. However, from his words, she could also sense the various bitterness concealed within those years of training…</p>
 <p>Ling Qingzhu's clear eyes drooped slightly as she withdrew the complicated emotions within her eyes. Finally, she shook her head and did not say anything.</p>
 <p>“A price we cannot afford? Are you certain you are not crazy?” Yuan Cang looked down at Lin Dong from high above and sneered.</p>
 <p>However, Lin Dong merely smiled faintly and nodded in the face of his sneer. His hands were clenched under his sleeve. Two grey stone beads had quietly appeared between his slender fingers as an obscure fluctuation that could not be described quietly surged.</p>
 <p>“I am certain… do you want to give it a try?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong lifted his head, a brilliant smile on his face as he stared at the Yuan Cang trio. Craziness faintly surged within his smile.</p>
