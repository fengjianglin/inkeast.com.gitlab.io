 <p><strong>Chapter 277: Subduing the High Class Symbol Puppet</strong></p>
 <p>When he sensed the chilling sensation from at his throat area, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s body immediately turned cold and rigid, not daring to make even the slightest bit of movement. Although he was currently already able to control the Symbol Puppet, he knew that before the Symbol Puppet could dash over, the sharp blade would be able to easily cut his throat.</p>
 <p>“Who are you? I am an elder of the Ghastly Puppet Cult!” Cold sweat flowed down from his forehead, as the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder forcibly calmed himself and sternly said.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I’m afraid that mentioning the Ghastly Puppet Cult in front of me will only cause you to die faster.” Lin Dong grinned a little as he slowly walked out from behind the elder.</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong?!”</p>
 <p>As he stared at the youngster who had appeared before him, the aged face of the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder twitched for a while. Evidently, he had not expected that the one who had seized him would actually be the Lin Dong, a person who had a huge grudge with the Ghastly Puppet Cult.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong slightly smiled as he glanced at the darkness above: “Teng Lei really trusts you a lot. To think that he would actually delay the Great Devil Sect above while allowing you to subdue this high class Symbol Puppet.”</p>
 <p>The Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s gaze flickered, as thoughts of how to escape constantly turned in his head. Due to Lin Dong’s Mental Energy fire sneak attack previously, the Mental Energy in the elder’s Niwan Palace was currently rebelling. However, as long as he was given some time, he would be able to restore control of his Mental Energy. At that time, once he had recovered his strength, he would be able to escape from Lin Dong’s hands and control the high class Symbol Puppet to give Lin Dong a fatal blow.</p>
 <p>“You should be thinking of how to kill me right?” While his gaze flickered, Lin Dong suddenly gave a small smile to the former as his two fingers abruptly thrust forth. At his fingertips, Mental Energy fire appeared before heavily landing onto the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s forehead, as a ‘chi chi’ noise sounded out.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Smoke rose from his forehead, as the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s complexion instantly turned pale. His already chaotic Niwan Palace was once again turned upside down by Lin Dong, as intense pain frantically gushed out, nearly burying his rationality.</p>
 <p>“You have two options, dispel the Mental Energy brand or I will kill you and do it myself.” Lin Dong slowly withdrew his fingers, shooting a glance at the pale Ghastly Puppet Cult elder as he declared in an indifferent tone.</p>
 <p>For the sake of waiting for the best opportunity, a Mental Energy brand had already been planted by this elder on the high class Symbol Puppet. If Lin Dong wanted to erase the Mental Energy brand, he would need to spend an extremely amount of effort, and even if he killed this old ghost now, he would still be unable to immediately erase the brand. After all, no matter what, this old guy was still a middle level Soul Symbol Master, hence, erasing his Mental Energy brand would not be so easy.</p>
 <p>“You must be dreaming!”</p>
 <p>After hearing Lin Dong’s words, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s face turned hideous as he replied in a sinister voice: “Kid, don’t be so arrogant. My Ghastly Puppet Cult troops are above, so let’s see how you’ll escape. If you’re smart, quickly release this elder, else this place will be your grave!”</p>
 <p>“Looks like you still don’t realise the current relationship between us and the situation you are in.” Upon hearing this, Lin Dong was a little regretful as he sighed. Soon after, his eyes slowly turned ice-cold, as the ancient halberd in his hand gently slid across the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s throat. Immediately, a thin line of blood appeared.</p>
 <p>“Wait!”</p>
 <p>Startled by the chill from his throat area, the corners of the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s eyes violently twitched, as he hastily voiced out. A high class Symbol Puppet was definitely valuable, but it would not be worthwhile for him to lose his life because of it.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s arm paused, as he apathetically stared at the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder, using his eyes to indicate for the latter to hurry up. When the latter saw this, he could only unwillingly grit his teeth as he stretched out a hand and touched the high class Symbol Puppet’s forehead area. Mental Energy gushed out from his palm, as the Mental Energy brand swiftly weakened.</p>
 <p>“Many thanks. Little Marten, look after this old guy.” Upon seeing the Mental Energy brand disappear, a smile surfaced on Lin Dong’s face, before he instructed Little Marten, who had appeared on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Yea.” Little Marten was all smiles as he nodded its head, before directly moving to the top of the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s head. Purplish black light slowly flowed around its claws, causing the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder to not dare to move even the slightest bit.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong turned around and gazed at the Symbol Puppet at the edge of the cave, as admiration appeared in his eyes. This Symbol Puppet was entirely dark black in color. Faintly, a slight trace of gold light was sprinkled over its body, and if one examined it closely, one would discover that these lights faintly formed into an indistinct but extremely cryptic and complicated symbols.</p>
 <p>Besides being covered in a dim luster due to the lack of energy, this Symbol Puppet was not damaged at all. Even so, when looking at the former, one could faintly feel an oppressive aura. High class Symbol Puppet. Even in the entire Great Yan Empire, only a few Symbol Puppets at this level could be found...</p>
 <p>“Excellent!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes swept over the high class Symbol Puppet before praising out. In comparison to this high class Symbol Puppet, the one he had obtained in the old tomb was really a little too shabby.</p>
 <p>“Let me first plant a Mental Energy brand.” After viewing for a while, Lin Dong restrained himself, as waves of Mental Energy quickly poured into the Symbol Puppet’s body to plant a Mental Energy brand. The situation now could not be considered too good, if Teng Lei and the rest discovered that he had secretly taken away the Symbol Puppet, they would definitely be furious. Although he did not fear Teng Lei in a one on one scenario, there were after all still quite a few troops, and Lin Dong would be unable to withstand their continuous attacks.</p>
 <p>However, if he was able to successfully subdue this high class Symbol Puppet, Lin Dong’s battle power would undoubtedly soar rapidly, such that he would no longer be the slightest bit fearful of facing the Ghastly Puppet Cult troops.</p>
 <p>As wave after wave of Lin Dong’s Mental Energy gushed into the high class Symbol Puppet, the Mental Energy brand that had disappeared from the latter’s forehead once again slowly started to surface.</p>
 <p>As he watched Lin Dong’s actions, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder’s complexion turned extremely hideous. It was as if a cooked duck was flying away in front of him. If news of this spread to the Ghastly Puppet Cult, his punishment would definitely not be light.</p>
 <p>However, though he knew the outcome would not be too good, when the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder felt the merciless undulations from the top of his head, he did not dare to make any movement at all. He did not doubt that if he dared to make even the smallest movement, the unremarkable looking Little Marten on his head would immediately split his head into half.</p>
 <p>Hence, after weighing his options, between throwing away his life and being punished, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder sensibly chose the latter...</p>
 <p>Creating the Mental Energy brand consumed quite a huge amount of Lin Dong’s time and Mental Energy. The amount of Mental Energy needed to control the high class Symbol Puppet also somewhat exceeded Lin Dong’s expectations. If his Mental Energy was not substantially stronger than others at the same stage, it would be very difficult to successfully plant a Mental Energy brand on this high class Symbol Puppet.</p>
 <p>“Phew…”</p>
 <p>As the last bit of Mental Energy poured into the Symbol Puppet, a radiant glow slowly blossomed from the latter’s dim body, while the golden patterns also spread out, forming into cryptic and complicated symbols.</p>
 <p>“Success!”</p>
 <p>As he stared at the Mental Energy brand that had formed on the Symbol Puppet’s head, delight surfaced in Lin Dong’s eyes. He had finally obtained a genuine high class Symbol Puppet!</p>
 <p>When the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder saw that Lin Dong had successfully subdued the Symbol Puppet, a trace of disappointment flitted across his eyes. Soon after, he gritted his teeth and spoke: “Now that you’ve obtained the Symbol Puppet, shouldn’t you let me go?”</p>
 <p>In his heart, he had already decided that once he could get away, he would immediately notify Teng Lei and the rest. If it was early enough, they might be able to stop a Lin Dong who had obtained the high class Symbol Puppet with their combined forces.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Lin Dong softly chuckled but ignored the elder. Instead, he concentrated on the high class Symbol Puppet in front of him, which was emitting an extremely strong oppressive aura. Although he dare not confirm that this Symbol Puppet was truly able to contend against a Manifestation stage practitioner, at least, when faced with a half-step to Manifestation stage practitioner like Lin Langtian, Lin Dong would not have any problems safely escaping.</p>
 <p>“However, the amount of Pure Yuan pills needed to control this high class Symbol Puppet is extremely frightening. To release a half-step to Manifestation stage attack like Lin Langtian, every attack would perhaps require tens of thousands of Pure Yuan pills.” Lin Dong’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. A high class Symbol Puppet was powerful, but it was also a Pure Yuan pill devouring bottomless hole. Even though he still had over twenty thousand Pure Yuan pills after robbing Hua Zong, it was clearly insufficient to freely utilise the high class Symbol Puppet. Hence, unless it was a critical moment, this high class Symbol Puppet would be preserved for saving his life.</p>
 <p>“Looks like these guys are not done fighting…” After successfully subduing the high class Symbol Puppet, Lin Dong felt much more relieved. He glanced at the area above before suddenly turning his head down, casting his gaze towards the darkness below.</p>
 <p>This Symbol Puppet lair led directly to the underground. The lower one went, the higher level the Symbol Puppets stored were. However, that level of Symbol Puppets most probably no longer existed, or else, the Ghastly Puppet Cult would not contest over a high class Symbol Puppet here.</p>
 <p>Of course, what Lin Dong cared most about now was not some Symbol Puppet. His main objective this time was the ‘Devouring Ancestral Symbol’!</p>
 <p>When he entered this Symbol Puppet lair, he faintly sensed the kind of undulations that caused the Destiny Soul Symbols in his Niwan Palace to tremble, which seemed to originate from the underground...</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Devouring Ancestral Symbol is at the bottom of this Symbol Puppet lair?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s gaze flickered. Soon after, without the slightest bit of hesitation, his hand reached out, emitting a sucking force which caused the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder to fly into his grasp. After giving a meaningful glance to Little Marten, the two of them swiftly flew towards the depths of the Symbol Puppet lair.</p>
 <p>“I must obtain the Devouring Ancestral Symbol!”</p>
 <p>His figure quickly descended while Lin Dong’s eyes turned increasingly heated. He knew that the most precious treasure in this Ancient Tablet space was likely the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, hence, he must make sure he obtained this legendary object no matter what!</p>
