Promptly, he laughed bitterly and said, “Now is not the ideal time to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu clenched her teeth and asked, “Can you use some techniques to stop him for a while?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong thought for a moment and said, “Though he is extremely powerful, it shouldn’t be impossible for me to stop him for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, Lin Dong clenched his hand. Then, a light formation quickly emerged on his palm. After which, it expanded with the wind and transformed into a giant light array, enveloping the entire mountain forest in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Ancient Universe Formation was formed, Lin Dong tossed the Great Desolate Tablet and the Mysterious Divine Palace towards that formation and strengthened it. With their help, it was possible to completely stabilize that formation. Therefore, no matter how powerful the Seventh Seat King was, it was likely that he would need to spend some time in order to break that formation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the meridians within Lin Dong’s body twitched after he setup that defensive formation. Immediately, there was more cold sweat on his forehead. Evidently, he was seriously injured and he even felt giddy in his mind. However, he forcefully suppressed it. After all, if he was to lose consciousness now, there was likely no way he could escape death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ancient Universe Formation should be able to stop him for a while. However, it can merely delay him.” Lin Dong panted as he looked at the Ancient Universe Formation that enveloped the entire mountain forest. Currently, there was an extremely powerful energy surging on the formation, isolating that place from the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, it’s not so easy to kill me. If I am pushed to my limits, I will just make the Ancient Universe Formation self-destruct. At that time, that fellow will also end up suffering.” Lin Dong gritted his teeth and said. Although he would have to pay a high price to do so, he could not be bothered about it at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu shook her head. Then, she glanced at Lin Dong before her pretty face reddened, “Can you release me first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now, did Lin Dong realize that the both of them were lying in a far too intimate position. In fact, his entire body was lying above Ling Qingzhu’s delicate figure. Although the soft sensation that he felt could lead one’s thoughts astray, now was not an appropriate moment. Therefore, he forcefully smiled and was just about to stand up, when the injuries on his body were once again triggered by his movements. Immediately, his body weakened before he crumbled on top of Ling Qingzhu again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu gasped softly after her body was pressed down by him. She tilted her head and saw Lin Dong clenching his teeth bitterly. Meanwhile, there was a pained expression on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw the miserable expression on Lin Dong’s face, a gentle emotion gradually surged into Ling Qingzhu’s eyes. She hesitated for a moment, before she used her hands to gently wipe off the perspiration on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We must leave here first. I will make the Ancient Universe Formation self-destruct later on. Carry me and go. The Sky Devouring Corpse will help us to stop him.” Lin Dong approached Ling Qingzhu’s delicate ear, before he gritted his teeth and said. As he spoke, he could sense weariness setting in rapidly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going to suffer huge losses this time around. Not only was he going to lose the Ancient Universe Formation, but it was also highly likely that he would lose the Sky Devouring Corpse. Other than the incident back at the Unique Devil City, this was the only other time he suffered such a huge loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ling Qingzhu gently shook her head after she heard his words. Then, she suddenly extended her small hand. Meanwhile, there was a dark red pill on her palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… eat it.” Ling Qingzhu placed that pill into Lin Dong’s mouth before she softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Healing medicine?” Lin Dong was startled. Without hesitation, he swallowed that pill. Soon after, he felt that something was amiss. In fact, a strange fiery hot sensation surged the moment that pill entered his body. Furthermore, the giddy sensation within his mind intensified. In fact, he felt so giddy that his eyelids began to droop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… what did you feed me?” Lin Dong muttered in a blurry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s nothing. Everything will be fine once you wake up.” Ling Qingzhu used her delicate hands to stroke Lin Dong’s face, before she softly bit her red lips and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his heart, Lin Dong vaguely felt that something was amiss. However, he was currently seriously injured. Therefore, as that feeble and fatigue sensation surged, it prevented him from awakening. Finally, his eyelids collapsed before his vision turned pitch-black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu looked at Lin Dong, who had fallen into a slumber. Meanwhile, her gorgeous face was completely fiery red. Then, she gently bit her silver teeth before she muttered softly, “The Zenith Sensing Art is a secret of our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace that has never been passed to an outsider. Technically speaking, there is no training manual for it. It is just a profound and mysterious sensation. Moreover, its powerful strength originates from the sensing location.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore… in order for you to sense that mysterious existence, other than inheriting it at birth, the only other way … is to do it through pair&nbsp;cultivation where both parties can sense it together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lin Dong was still awake at this moment, he would be bewildered by her words. After all, he never expected that such a method was required to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. It’s no wonder Ling Qingzhu was outraged when Lin Dong first mentioned this to her. It’s actually because…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu gently supported his body. After which, she bit her lips before she said, “The person hiding within his body, come out now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A light began to glimmer on the surface of Lin Dong’s body. After which, Yan drifted out. When he saw the boiling red expression on Ling Qingzhu’s face, he involuntarily laughed dryly. However, there was an odd emotion within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What you have given him… to eat…” Yan looked at Ling Qingzhu and laughed dryly, “Is it an aphrodisiac?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the only way for him to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’.” Ling Qingzhu lowered her eyes. Her face was as red as blood as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan was a little speechless at this moment. He finally understood that Ling Qingzhu had likely thought of this scene when Lin Dong first mentioned that he wanted to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. It was also most likely why she asked Lin Dong to never mention this matter again. Clearly, she was struggling with it in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she had a cold personality and appeared to be indifferent to everything, there was no way she could treat this matter in the same way. This was especially since the other party was Lin Dong. Therefore, she merely followed quietly beside him during this journey. Clearly, she was using this method to overcome certain obstacles in her heart and make up her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at the final moment, she still lacked the courage. Therefore, she decided to use this method, which left one neither able to laugh nor cry. After all, regardless of how cold a lady was, she would still be as timid and embarrassed as an ordinary girl when dealing with such matters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan sighed. Since Lin Dong was able to get this cool, haughty and intelligent girl to use such a stupid method, he could be considered as fairly “capable”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I trouble you with something?” Ling Qingzhu suddenly lifted her head, before she looked at Yan and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not tell him about this.” Ling Qingzhu carefully rubbed off the blood on the corner of Lin Dong’s lips, before she softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Yan was startled. Clearly, he did not understand her thoughts. A girl like Ling Qingzhu obviously viewed such matters with great importance. In fact, she typically wore a veil to conceal her appearance and it was difficult for an ordinary man to see her actual face. Moreover, her body was still pure and had only been touched once by Lin Dong in a complete accident. Therefore, it must have been difficult for her to make such a sacrifice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan smiled bitterly and nodded. It seems like Ling Qingzhu clearly understood why Lin Dong wanted to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. Given his character, if he knew how much Ling Qingzhu had to sacrifice in order for him to do so, it was likely that he would feel extremely guilty towards her. This was something that the haughty Ling Qingzhu did not want to see.</span></p>

The demeanor she displayed at this moment caused Yan to be startled. He quickly sighed before he drifted far away. Relationships between men and women were indeed troubling matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw that Yan had disappeared into the distance, Ling Qingzhu finally used her icy cool hands to touch her own face. Then, she turned to look at Lin Dong. After which, she waved her hand before a glow shot out from her sleeve. Soon after, it transformed into a sparkling bamboo house. This was clearly a Soul Treasure. However, other than hiding from the rain, it was of little use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu gently carried Lin Dong as she walked into that bamboo house. Then, she carefully placed him on the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu sat by the edge of the bed, before she stared at that familiar looking face. When she first met him many years ago, his face was still a little tender and immature looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, she had never imagined that she would end up doing something like this one day. If she knew, it was likely that she would have directly killed him on that mountain top with her sword. After which, she would no longer have anything to worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked at Lin Dong. A long while later, her gorgeous face became fiery red. Finally, she gently bit her lips before she slowly stood up. Her hands were trembling as she gently undid her waist wrap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her snow white dress fell. After which, a perfect and flawless naked body was exposed within this bamboo house. Meanwhile, her body was trembling gently and she looked so beautiful that it could mesmerize one’s soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You did this to me back then. Now… now, you deserve this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She glanced at the man on the bed. Currently, even though he had fainted, his body was still emitting great heat. As she recalled what happened in the past, as well as his blood covered miserable face when he tried to protect her, she involuntarily laughed softly. Then, tears gathered in her eyes before they rolled down her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, she waved her hand, before the bamboo house darkened completely. However, there was the scent of lust blooming within the darkness.</span></p>
