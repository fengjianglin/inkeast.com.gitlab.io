Everything returned to the right track. There would perhaps still be many cruel struggles in the world, but there would also be a continuous stream of strong individuals being honed from such struggled. In the far off and distant future, a monster like genius might once again appear from nowhere, and advance into the legendary Ancestor stage.</span></p>

He lowered his head and looked at Dao Sect under the swirling clouds. Ling Qingzhu, Qingtan, Little Marten, Little Flame, the Life Death Master and the others were standing behind him and looking at his back. Although this back appeared rather thin, it possess a prestige which could not be described.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This prestige originated from his position as the Dimension Master.</span></p>

Although she ignited her Reincarnation, it has not been long since she did so. There should still be some of her Reincarnation fragments in this world. If I can find her Reincarnation fragments, I will be able to send her into a Reincarnation and even ensure her memories remain.” Lin Dong gazed at Dao Sect. He slowly began to speak a moment later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much confidence do you have?” Joy flashed across the Flame Master and the rest’s eyes when they heard this. However, he still asked in a worried manner. Although Lin Dong was all powerful now, igniting one’s Reincarnation was equivalent to death. How could it possibly be easy to save someone after that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be fifty percent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong muttered. A trace of worry had unknowingly flashed in his heart, while his hand involuntarily clenched tightly. Although he currently possessed the strongest power in this world, what was the purpose of such strength if he could not even save someone he loved?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cultivated for the sake of protecting those whom he wished to protect. Yet, he now discovered that he could not do so…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soft hand gently held his large hand. There was a smooth and warm feeling from it, causing Lin Dong’s emotions to calm down. He turned his head and looked at the fairy like Ling Qingzhu in white. Her pretty eyes were quietly looking at him. The gentleness within them could not be hidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong also gave a tender look to Ling Qingzhu, who had not spoken much. Gratitude and warmth flowed within his heart as he tightly held her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had always been like this, quietly hiding all of her emotions deep within her heart. She could give up her haughtiness for him, and become gentle to comfort him. When his heart was at its weakest, she always quietly stood by his side. Even if she did not speak, such actions were able to let Lin Dong feel some warmth. However, this stubborness of hers would at time cause one’s heart to ache slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the past, I only watched you from afar. Now, I will have to try and make up for it.” Ling Qingzhu smiled and softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong grinned. Given Ling Qingzhu’s aloof character, only by truly walking into the deepest part of her hurt would one be able to break the layers of cold ice that pushed others far away, and enjoy the passion and gentleness reserved for a single person. It was evident that Lin Dong had initially not reached this level. Hence, the Ling Qingzhu of that time did not have any responsibility to take care of him, and there was no reason for compensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we are talking about compensation, you have already done so when you taught me the Zenith Sensing Art…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu was slightly startled, and her pretty face quickly flushed red. She bit her red lips and stared at Lin Dong. In her eyes was a bashfulness that could not be hidden. “You… you know about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have known since the beginning…” Lin Dong looked at Ling Qingzhu with very tender eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu’s teeth bit her red lips tightly. She lifted her hand in embarrassment and gently hammered Lin Dong’s arm. She had originally thought that she had hid it very well. It was &nbsp;unexpectedly that this fellow had actually been putting up an act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should quickly begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled and nodded. Without further ado, he sat down on the mountain peak as both of his eyes slowly shut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu and the others by the side could feel an extremely mysterious fluctuation being emitted when he shut his eyes. This fluctuation was very swift. In the blink of an eye, it had already enveloped the entire world. After which, it began to search inch by an inch, attempting to find the Reincarnation fragments that might have been scattered in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s will spread over this world. He used the Power of the Dimension and searched for a certain familiar presence that existed deep in his heart…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This search took an entire month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Dong’s face gradually paled with the flow of time. He realised that despite having activated the Dimension Power to search every corner of this world, he was still unable to find even a slight trace of those familiar Reincarnation fragments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This futile effort caused slivers of panic to rise in his calm heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a result was really unbearable for him. Hence, he suddenly clenched his teeth and once again activated the Dimension Power. This time, he searched every place related to her. Dao Sect, the Unique Devil Region and the area where they had once fought for the Immortal Yuan Ancient Tree…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normally speaking, Reincarnation fragments would remain in the place that one had the most attachment to when one was alive. If Ying Huanhuan’s Reincarnation fragments were still around, she would definitely be in these places!</span></p>

Her smile was like warm sunlight, which shone deep into Lin Dong’s heart. “Without me, there is no telling just what a fool like you will end up doing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong tightly grasped Ling Qingzhu’s hand and laughed heartily, “Of course you have to accompany me.

The fatigue between his brows had been completely swept away, and a heroic look had replaced it. She smiled. That familiar Lin Dong was back.</span></p>

He frowned and said, “We do not have any coordinates for that new world. In order to head to that place, we need to find someone who belongs to that world, and use that person as a guide to travel across the planes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Someone who belongs to that world?” Ling Qingzhu thought for a moment and said, “The Yimo Emperor?”</span></p>

He quickly clenched his teeth and said, “It doesn’t matter. I will use the Dimension Eye to search. Since Ying Huanhuan could end up in this world, there might be a second person who has also come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong activated the Dimension Power after his voice sounded. The light of Primal Chaos surfaced between his brows, and turned into a Primal Chaos eye. That eye seemed to encompass everything. Light swept forth, and swiftly fell over every corner of this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was not easy to find someone from another world here. Hence, Lin Dong began to frown as more time passed.</span></p>

Little Marten, Qingtan, the Flame Master and others appeared in a flash. They felt surprised when they saw that Lin Dong had suddenly become full of life again.</span></p>

After which, he dotingly patted her little head. With a shift of his gaze, the Dimension Eye continued its search.</span></p>

Subsequently, he slowly turned his head back, as the Primal Chaos light that the Dimension Eye had turned into wrapped around Qingtan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mysterious, dark and cold ripples surfaced on Qingtan’s figure under the Primal Chaos light of the Dimension Eye. This fluctuation was completely different from any energy in this world.</span></p>

She lowered her head to observe herself, before asking in a lost voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong merely stared at her in a stunned manner. By the side, Ling Qingzhu seemed to have realised something. She looked at Qingtan in disbelief. “Could Qingtan be…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong violently swallowed his saliva and slowly nodded.</span></p>

Lin Xiao, Liu Yan, Little Marten and others were present by the side of the cliff. They looked at the sky, and saw space slowly splitting apart. This crack was exactly the same as the huge crack between the planes which had appeared in the void back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingzhu, Qingtan.”</span></p>

Two enchanting figures rushed out upon hearing this, and stood on his left and right.</span></p>

I will first head there and scout the place!” Lin Dong smilingly replied. He swung his sleeve, and eight lights rushed out from within his body. They turned into eight Ancestral Symbols. One of the Ancestral Symbols flashed, and turned into a little girl. She was Mu Lingshan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingshan, this is the newly created Life Death Ancestral Symbol. Put it in your body and nourish it. A century later, a new Life and Death Ancestral Symbol will be born. At that time, you will no longer be restricted by it, and truly turn into a human.” Lin Dong flicked his finger, and a black and white light shot into Mu Lingshan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Lin Dong, make sure to come back often!” Mu Lingshan waved her small hand and said.</span></p>

Liu Yan by the side glared at him in an accusing fashion.</span></p>
