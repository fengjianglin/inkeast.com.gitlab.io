 <p><strong>Chapter 246: The Evolved Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd</strong></p>
 <p>Seeing that Lin Dong chose to stay here, grandmaster Cheng merely glanced at the former in a indifferent manner, and did not say anything more. His finger flicked, as the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd before him floated up. After which, one could only see a flame suddenly flashed in his eyes, before actually directly penetrating through, and gushing out.</p>
 <p>“Mental Energy fire!”</p>
 <p>As he stared at the almost transparent colored flame hovering before grandmaster Cheng, Lin Dong’s heart was jolted. He knew that this was the legendary Mental Energy fire, the kind of Mental Energy flame that was born only when Mental Energy had been condensed to the limit.</p>
 <p>The main reason why a Soul Symbol Master’s attacking power far surpassed an ordinary Symbol Master was the existence of this Mental Energy fire. In the face of this kind of Mental Energy fire, even Yuan Power cultivators who had reached the Qi Creation stage did not dare to be the slightest bit neglectful. After all, if one was heavily injured by this thing, it was very likely to leave behind an extremely serious residual effect.</p>
 <p>Mental Energy fire did not do much harm to the body, but to the mind, it possessed an exceptionally strong erosion power.</p>
 <p>After summoning the Mental Energy fire, grandmaster Cheng’s expression slowly turned to one of concentration. His sleeves waved about, as the ball of Mental Energy fire spread out, wrapping around the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd.</p>
 <p>“Creak creak!”</p>
 <p>As the Mental Energy fire gushed forth, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd immediately started to tremble violently, and the numerous tiny scales on its body suddenly gave signs of opening up.</p>
 <p>With respect to this situation, grandmaster Cheng’s expression did not change, as he opened his mouth and spit out another ball of Mental Energy fire, which wrapped around a dark golden metal material.</p>
 <p>“Ch!”</p>
 <p>As it was burned by Mental Energy fire, the solid metal material gradually started to melt at a slow speed. Some greyish black impurities dripped down from it, landing on the ground, and corroding tiny holes in it.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong silently sat in the hall, watching grandmaster Cheng’s every move without blinking. As a fellow Symbol Master, he was able to sense that while the metal material was refined, the latter’s Mental Energy transformed into thousands of strands and poured in, changing the countless tiny bonds. This was an extremely complex work, and only practitioners that possessed powerful Mental Energy would be able to have such meticulous control.</p>
 <p>Under Lin Dong’s watch, the dark golden metal material was completely transformed into a ball of viscous golden fluid after three whole hours.</p>
 <p>After this refinement process, grandmaster Cheng’s gnarly finger lightly pointed, as the ball of golden liquid sprinkled on the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd in an extremely well-distributed way.</p>
 <p>“Ch ch!”</p>
 <p>As this dark golden liquid was sprinkled on it, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd’s trembling turned increasingly intense. Under the tempering of Mental Energy fire, this fluid assimilated into the halberd’s body little by little, causing a trace of dark gold to be added to the ancient halberd. Faintly, the halberd’s body also seemed to grow longer.</p>
 <p>After completing this step, grandmaster Cheng once again started to refine the other materials. Towards this repeated actions, Lin Dong did not show even the slightest bit of irritation. His attentive look was like a studious disciple, as he took in grandmaster Cheng’s every little movement.</p>
 <p>This continuous refining of materials lasted for an entire day. Over this period of time, Lin Dong did not close his eyes at all. After training to his level, even ten days without sleeping was nothing much. His strong body was enough to deal with the tiredness normal people felt.</p>
 <p>On the second night, the last material was melted into liquid, and adhered to the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd.</p>
 <p>The current Ancient Heavenly Scales halberd seemed a little multi-colored, a vastly different look than its original scarlet color. Every part had a different color, and this was because the refining had yet to be complete.</p>
 <p>“Phew…”</p>
 <p>After the last material was refined, grandmaster Cheng sighed in relief. He looked at Lin Dong, and casually said: “I will first rest once before starting the final step. During this step, I will blend the various characteristics of these rare materials into the ancient halberd. If I succeed, your ancient halberd will become a high-grade Soul Treasure, but if the fusion fails, the original structure will be destroyed, and this ancient halberd will be no more.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing these words, Lin Dong’s heart clenched tightly, as he heavily nodded his head.</p>
 <p>After saying this, grandmaster Cheng straightaway closed his eyes, resting this way for five whole hours before finally opening his eyes again. Currently, his Mental Energy had mostly recovered. His expression slowly turned solemn, as he opened his mouth, and extremely vigorous Mental Energy gushed forth, wrapping around the now colorful Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom!”</p>
 <p>Wave after wave of heat spread out in the hall. This heatwave was very strange, it clearly did not give off the feeling of being overly hot, but it caused one to feel as if one was in an oven.</p>
 <p>Mental Energy gushed out from Lin Dong’s Niwan Palace, and completely covered his body, as the unusual heatwave dissipated into nothingness. His unwavering gaze was fixed on the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd that was wrapped in the raging Mental Energy fire. He knew, that this was the most crucial moment.</p>
 <p>“Creak!”</p>
 <p>Faced with the Mental Energy fire that had suddenly become much fiercer than before, wisps of green smoke actually started rising from the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd. The numerous liquids that adhered to the surface of the ancient halberd also began to boil, and were forced by the Mental Energy fire to continuously invade the interior of the ancient halberd.</p>
 <p>“Buzz!”</p>
 <p>As the characteristics of these metal materials invaded the interior of the ancient halberd, the balance between them seemed to be broken. The halberd frantically shook, faintly emitting a buzzing sound. Rays of dazzling light also burst out from the ancient halberd, the formidable light violently shooting towards the hall, while filled with tyrannical destructive power.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>Feeling the resistance from the ancient halberd, grandmaster Cheng snorted. A portion of powerful Mental Energy rushed forth, transforming into a Mental Energy prison, which bounded up the area a dozen meters around the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd. When the rays shot onto the Mental Energy prison, they caused several ripples to form, which quickly dissipated.</p>
 <p>“You better fuse for me!”</p>
 <p>Grandmaster Cheng’s expression turned serious, and soon after, his huge hand suddenly clenched, as the Mental Energy fire around the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd abruptly shrunk.</p>
 <p>“Ch!”</p>
 <p>As the Mental Energy fire abruptly shrunk, all of the metal liquid on the ancient halberd was directly pushed into the ancient halberd. A resplendent ray instantly shot out from the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd, penetrating the surrounding Mental Energy prison, and leaving behind a deep black hole in the ground.</p>
 <p>“Such a tyrannical Soul Treasure!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this scene, astonishment flashed across grandmaster Cheng’s eyes. Soon after, his huge hand grabbed in the air, as an invisible large Mental Energy hand firmly grabbed onto the ancient halberd which was giving off resplendent light.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was incomparably nervous as he stared at the struggling Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd in grandmaster Cheng’s hand. He was faintly able to see that as the light rushed out, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd’s shape seemed to undergo tiny changes, while its formidable aura also grew increasingly dense.</p>
 <p>“Buzz buzz!”</p>
 <p>Urgent buzzing noises were endlessly emitted by the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd. Later on, that buzzing sound seemed to gradually evolve into an extremely low and unique dragon’s cry.</p>
 <p>That cry quietly resounded in the hall, causing Lin Dong’s and grandmaster Cheng’s expressions to change. The former was pleasantly surprised, while the latter was shocked, he clearly did not expect that this ancient halberd would actually be able to emit the legendary cry of a mythological beast.</p>
 <p>“Swish!”</p>
 <p>While grandmaster Cheng was shocked, the light on the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd grew even brighter, and directly blew up the huge Mental Energy hand. An extremely formidable light burst forth, directly shattering the hall’s ceiling to bits.</p>
 <p>“Come here!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong hastily beckoned, and the resplendent ray of light flew over, before finally extremely obediently appearing in his hand.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong held the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd and heavily stamped on the ground. The light on it slowly weakened, and when he looked at it, a breathtaking look instantly appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Compared to before the refining, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd was now even longer, and the tiny scales on the halberd’s body now leaned towards a heavy and dark gold color. However, what mainly caused Lin Dong’s pupils to shrink, was that the arrangement of the scales seemed to faintly form the shape of a dragon, and looked extremely mystical.</p>
 <p>At the tip of the halberd, two sharp points extended at an angle from the left and right. A cold light seemed to flash between, giving it a sinister and bloodthirsty look, like that of a huge dragon’s maw that could swallow the world. Its presence was astonishing indeed.</p>
 <p>“Excellent!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong fondled the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd admiringly, as delight bubbled up in his eyes. The current Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd was several times stronger than before. According to Lin Dong’s guess, even when compared to Wang Yan’s Great Luo Golden Spear, the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd would not give way in the slightest!</p>
 <p>“Truly a great Soul Treasure!”</p>
 <p>While Lin Dong lovingly fiddled with the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd, the tightly shut hall door was suddenly pushed open. A figure walked in, passionately staring at the ancient halberd in Lin Dong’s hands, while intense greed swirled in his eyes.</p>
 <p>The person who had suddenly barged in caused Lin Dong’s and grandmaster Cheng’s expressions to change. As cast their gazes over, their expressions darkened.</p>
 <p>“Hua Zong!”</p>
 <p>Staring at the person who had barged in, Lin Dong’s expression sunk a little. This person actually turned out to be the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s Hua Zong!</p>
