 <p><strong>Chapter 214: Extortion</strong></p>
 <p>“Little Flame!”</p>
 <p>As he gazed at the huge beast which arrived from the skies, Lin Dong was stunned, but soon after, delight surfaced in his eyes.</p>
 <p>In the sky, the huge beast stood in the air while its body was covered in a dark red crystal armor. From time to time, sparks flickered on the crystal armor, making it seem extremely similar to the Thunder Crystal Beast’s crystal armor. Furthermore, two electrifying wings of lightning grew from Little Flame’s back, and as they shook, they emitted the low rumble of thunder.</p>
 <p>Evidently, after consuming the flesh and blood of the Thunder Crystal Beast, Little Flame had absorbed some of the essence within its blood and thus underwent its current transformation.</p>
 <p>On Little Flames’ back was a huge python which was covered by a layer of scarlet red crystals. Meanwhile, within that python’s mouth, lightning seemed to flicker as it hissed, giving it a sinister feeling.</p>
 <p>The current Little Flame had completely changed compared to before. No one could predict that Little Flame’s transformation would actually be so shocking after absorbing the essence of the Thunder Crystal Beast’s blood.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>As if it heard Lin Dong’s voice, the impressive huge beast in the sky bent down and roared towards Lin Dong. The huge python on its back suddenly shot forward lightning-quick, as it charged into the midst of the Di and Liu Family troops. Immediately, lightning flashed as a powerful energy gushed forth, bringing miserable cries in its wake.</p>
 <p>Little Flame’s current strength was clearly comparable to the Form Creation stage. The scarlet red crystal armor covering its body bestowed upon it a strong defensive shield. Lightning gushed about, causing its attacks to become rather formidable. Although the Di and Liu Families still had quite a few perfect Yuan Dan stage practitioners, they were evidently already unable to do any harm to Little Flame. Hence, this intense fight was completely one-sided.</p>
 <p>However, though Little Flame’s attack had caused them to fall into chaos, nonetheless, thanks to their overwhelming numbers, after they finally combined forces, they were barely able to withstand the lightning attacks.</p>
 <p>“Hey, if you keep being so troublesome, you will likely have to collect their dead bodies.”</p>
 <p>As he saw Little Flame toying with the troops from the two families, Lin Dong said with an indifferent tone. At the same time, the halberd in his hand moved closer to the Di Teng duo’s throats, causing them to freeze in fear.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s words instantly caused the Di and Liu Family troops to stop struggling. When they saw the sight before them, they already understood that this time, both their families had lost to a youngster who looked extremely youthful...</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” Di Teng’s body trembled slightly. The sharp pain from his mind made him understand that his injuries this time were extremely severe, and if not treated properly, there would be serious repercussions. Of course, there was no point in thinking about these things now, the utmost priority was to first protect his own life...</p>
 <p>He was an intelligent person, based on the fact that Lin Dong did not immediately kill them, he could tell that Lin Dong currently did not have the intention to kill them. Or else, Lin Dong would not have let him talk so much nonsense.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, a small smile surfaced on Lin Dong’s face. In response, a sinking feeling appeared in Di Teng’s and Liu Kui’s hearts.</p>
 <p>“Want your lives? Then use Pure Yuan pills to buy them.”</p>
 <p>When they heard the casual chuckle that sounded out in their ears, Di Teng and Liu Kui sighed in relief in their hearts. As long as they were able to survive, that would be for the best.</p>
 <p>“Two hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills per person.”</p>
 <p>However, before they could completely relax, Lin Dong’s following words almost caused them to choke to death.</p>
 <p>“Two hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills, even if you sell my entire Di Family, we will still be unable to obtain such a sum!” Di Teng’s face was green as he growled. How could they possibly afford such an astronomical figure. Did this guy really think that they were a pill production factory!</p>
 <p>“Two hundred thousand, I think it will be better for you to just kill us. After we pay this amount, our families would be rendered useless anyway!” Liu Kui gnashed his teeth as he said.</p>
 <p>After seeing the violent reactions of the duo, Lin Dong rubbed his chin. It seems like the number he had off-handedly said was indeed too tremendous, or else it was unlikely that this duo would rather give up on their lives.</p>
 <p>“How about this, I’ll give in. One hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills per person. No more bargaining.” Lin Dong muttered to himself for a while before he casually said.</p>
 <p>When they heard the trace of impatience in Lin Dong’s voice, Di Teng and Liu Kui, whom were just about to speak again, instantly shut their mouths, . Though one hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills was likewise not a small sum, their two families were at least able to afford it.</p>
 <p>Nearby, the Liu and Di Family troops were dumbstruck as they watched the negotiation that was occurring before their eyes. For a moment, their gazes turned somewhat strange as they looked towards Lin Dong...</p>
 <p>“Eh, stop looking and hand over the Pure Yuan pills. One hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills per person. Thank you.” When he saw their strange gazes, Lin Dong involuntarily chuckled as he said.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Lin Dong’s calm voice, the place turned quiet while Di Teng and Liu Kui could only take out the Qiankun bags which they stored Pure Yuan pills in. Yet, one hundred thousand was evidently too huge a figure, hence they duo still fell short of about fifty thousand Pure Yuan pills after clearing out all their Qiankun bags.</p>
 <p>As he watched the stiff expression on the Di Teng duo’s faces, Lin Dong could not be bothered with them, and grinned before he said: “Eh, you still have so many underlings here. Let them top up the rest, without two hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills, I will not let anyone go.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing these words, not only did the Di Teng duo start to tremble involuntarily, but even the sight before the Di and Liu Family troops began to turn black. This guy would not even let off small fries like them...</p>
 <p>“You guys go gather fifty thousand Pure Yuan pills.” Di Teng swallowed a mouthful of saliva, as he stared at the sharp halberd at this throat. He had no choice but to thicken his skin and command the Di and Liu Family troops.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that even the family head had spoken, the troops from the two families could only force a smile. Then, the hundred or so men huddled together, before they finally gathered fifty thousand Pure Yuan pills and handed it over to Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>As he held the Qiankun bag in his hand, Lin Dong’s Mental Energy scanned it. Soon after, he nodded his head in satisfaction and kept all of the Pure Yuan pills into the high class Qiankun bag he had snatched from Wang Yan. Then, he smiled as he stuffed the Qiankun bag into his clothes.</p>
 <p>“We’ve already given you the Pure Yuan pills, you can now release my father and the Liu Family head right?” The youth in black’s face was green as he said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong cast a glance at him. Under Lin Dong’s gaze, the youth in black hastily withdrew several steps, and hid in the crowd. Now that practically all their Pure Yuan pills had been taken away by Lin Dong, if he was caught by Lin Dong to be used as blackmail, there would be no more Pure Yuan pills to save him.</p>
 <p>“Haix, my old friend Di Teng, originally, you did not have to lose these Pure Yuan pills…” Lin Dong turned his head and smiled at Di Teng. Soon after, the halberd in his hand suddenly jerked before he viciously flung the duo towards their men like sand bags.</p>
 <p>“Heh heh, many thanks to the two of you for your presents this time, I hope that we will meet again someday.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong kept the ancient halberd in his hand , before clasping his fists towards Di Teng and the rest. With a leap, he once again appeared in Little Flame’s back, as the latter’s lightning wings shook. The sound of thunder rumbled, as they transformed into a flash of lightning and flew away.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>As they watched Lin Dong’s fading figure, Di Teng and Liu Kui were so angry that they almost vomited a mouthful of blood. Not only were all their efforts this time wasted, they had even lost a hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills each. Even to factions like theirs, it was a tremendous blow.</p>
 <p>However, though they were angry, they could not do anything about it. The power that Lin Dong had displayed caused fear to arise in their hearts, especially since Little Flame had also advanced to the Form Creation stage and its strength had soared. They did not doubt that if Lin Dong truly wanted to finish them off, rivers of blood would flow and their losses would be horrible.</p>
 <p>Compared to this kind of outcome, losing a hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills was already the best situation.</p>
 <p>“Where did this bastard appear from, since when was there such a frightening youngster in Dayang Province. Reaching the Form Creation stage at such an age, even in the Great Yan Empire, his potential is extremely outstanding. Why would he appear in such a deserted area!” Liu Kui had a belly full of fire as he said.</p>
 <p>“When we first encountered him, he had already extorted twenty thousand Pure Yuan pills from us…” Di Teng was silent for a while before he said.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Liu Kui was taken aback, as he looked towards Di Teng with a little sympathy. It turns out that it was already the second time that this guy had been enjoyed such treatment.</p>
 <p>“What now?” Liu Kui asked.</p>
 <p>“What else can we do? That brat’s strength is likely already comparable to an advanced Form Creation stage practitioner. Can we find such a practitioner for help? Furthermore, don’t forget that this guy still has a pet that is not weaker than us.” Di Teng had a gloomy expression on his face as he replied.</p>
 <p>“Truly such horrible luck. If I knew this would happen, I would not even make a move against the Thunder Crystal Beast. Now, all the benefits has gone to someone else!” Liu Kui was indignant as he complained. An underling supported him as he stood up, before he waved his sleeves and left in rage.</p>
 <p>“God damnit, let’s go!”</p>
 <p>After seeing this, Di Teng resentfully cursed out, as he brought his troops and left.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Above the vast forests, lightning streaked across the horizon, bringing with it the low rumble of thunder.</p>
 <p>“Kid, are you just gonna let them go this way?” Little Marten once again appeared on Lin Dong’s shoulder, looking back as it chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Although the Di and Liu Families are not weak, they do not pose any threat towards me. We are only stopping here for a short time, even if they want to, they can do nothing about it. Moreover...I believe that as long as they are not fools, they should not have the courage to anger me again.” Lin Dong casually smiled as he said.</p>
 <p>With his current strength, Little Marten and the Symbol Puppet, they were basically equivalent to four Form Creation stage practitioners. It would not be too difficult for them to exterminate the Di and Liu Families with such a line-up.</p>
 <p>With power, one naturally had no need to fear.</p>
 <p>“This time, you’ve reaped quite a harvest. Not only did you master the Great Sun Thunder Body’s Bronze Thunder Body, you’ve also advanced to the Form Creation stage and the fourth seal Symbol Master. In the Great Yan Empire, this kind of power can already be considered strong.” Little Marten nodded its head, as it looked at Lin Dong and said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong laughed in response. The benefits from refining the thunder source had indeed far surpassed his expectations.</p>
 <p>“Now, let’s head directly to the Great Desolation Province. I am rather curious about this so-called most wonderful and chaotic place in the Great Yan Empire…”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong lifted his head and gazed into distance as he softly mumbled.</p>
