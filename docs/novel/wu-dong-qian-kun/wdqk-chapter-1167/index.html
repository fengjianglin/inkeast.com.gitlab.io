After the light faded, the people from both sides were revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a total of six people from the three great Tiger tribes who had arrived, and all of them possessed the strength of the Samsara stage. It was obvious that the three great Tiger tribes had heavily invested this time. They had dispatched many top experts from their tribes because of the commotion of the shattered space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As one of the eight great king tribes, although their foundations might be inferior to that of the four overlord tribes, it should not be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite the powerful lineup of the three great Tiger tribes, their current expressions did not look good at all. This was because there were a dozen figures standing in the sky opposite them. Those fierce eyes were akin to wolves and tigers. First elder Zhu Li, Liu Qing, the Golden Ape Demon Commander and the others, who had been separated from Lin Dong’s group earlier, had all arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This lineup, which was a gathering of experts from Four Titans Palace, Dragon tribe and Celestial Demon Marten tribe, was clearly much grander when compared to the three great Tiger tribes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The originally intense fighting in the sky gradually came to a halt as the forces from both sides arrived. The faces of the experts from the three great Tiger tribes trembled as they looked at the coldly smiling Liu Qing and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First elder Zhu Li and Liu Qing were both top experts who had touched the power of reincarnation, and their strength was far from what ordinary Samsara stage expert could compare to. If they were to fight, it was likely that just the two of them alone would be able to block the lineup from the three great Tiger tribes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh, I said that you three great Tiger tribes are really becoming increasingly bold. You are obviously aware that Lin Dong is our Dragon tribe’s Punishment Elder, yet you actually dare to attack him. This is clearly looking down on our Dragon tribe right?” Liu Qing smiled in a strange manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah Diao is my Celestial Demon Marten tribe’s junior tribe leader. Attacking him is equivalent to challenging our Celestial Demon Marten tribe.” First Elder Zhu Li also said in an indifferent voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bodies of the experts from the three great Tiger tribes stiffened slightly upon hearing this. Although the three great Tiger tribes were rather influential in the Demonic Beast World, it was obvious that they did not dare offend the Dragon tribe and the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, two of the overlord tribes. If word of this reached their tribes, they would definitely be severely punished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha ha, please do not be angry. This is merely a misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two elders of the Heavenly Devil Tiger tribe laughed dryly. Although it was possible for them to accept offending these two overlord tribes if they could obtain the last bloodline of the Darkness Saint Tiger, it was obvious that they had already lost the best opportunity to snatch it. In that case, it would be far too foolish to offend the Dragon tribe and the Celestial Demon Marten tribe again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Commander Yan of Four Titans Palace possess the bloodline of our Heavenly Devil Tiger tribe. As such, he can be considered a part of the family. How could we possibly have any ill intentions towards him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame inwardly sneered upon hearing this as ferociousness flashed across his tiger eyes. The Heavenly Devil Tiger tribe had made him exceptionally displeased today. He would have to properly settle the scores when he had the opportunity to in future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leader Lin Dong, we were the ones who being impulsive earlier, and this old man will apologise to you here. May I know if you can first release Luo Teng?” The elder from the Dark Abyss Tiger tribe glanced at Luo Teng, who was still trapped by Lin Dong, before cupping his hands together as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can release him. However, I hope that everyone will be careful with regards to what they say and do. Otherwise, do not blame me for killing.” Lin Dong glanced at the elder. He mused for a moment before speaking in a faint voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Teng and the rest gnashed their teeth upon hearing this. However, they could only nod their heads. Lin Dong’s words were extremely clear. He wanted them to shut their mouths and not say anything about the last bloodline of the Darkness Saint Tiger tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after seeing this did Lin Dong wave his hand. The Mysterious Divine Palace quickly turned into a ray of light and returned to him. The formation, which trapped Luo Teng, also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was a little furious in his heart due to the actions of the three great Tiger tribes, now was not the time to fight with them. After all, his ultimate goal was the Devouring Divine Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were clearly many strong individuals after the inheritance of the Devouring Master. It was unwise to exhaust their strength here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Teng’s expression was a little volatile after he was released However, he also understood the situation and no longer had his previous ferocity. This was especially the case under the fierce eyes of Liu Qing. All he could do was angrily land on the ground and help Luo Lie, who had become extremely weak after that single attack from Lin Dong, to his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luo Lie’s expression was also steely green. He had been turned into such a miserable state by Lin Dong in front of so many eyes despite having the numerical advantage over the latter. It was likely that many would mock him if word of this spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he felt bitter in his heart, Luo Lie was also able to adapt to the situation. All he could do was wave his hand and swiftly lead the experts from the Dark Abyss Tiger tribe away. The other two great Tiger tribes could only smile awkwardly after seeing the Dark Abyss Tiger tribe leave. They too cupped their hands together towards Lin Dong before leaving in a dejected manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The anticlimactic ending of the considerably intense fight caused the surrounding onlookers to shake their heads in a regretful manner. They wondered just what was wrong with these three great Tiger tribes. The latter obviously knew that Four Titans Palace had the Dragon tribe and Celestial Demon Marten tribe backing them. Yet, they still challenged Four Titans Palace, an act that was practically seeking their own humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various experts in the sky did not linger any longer after seeing that the show had come to an end and quickly scattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not been long since we separated and you have already offended the three great Tiger tribes…” After seeing that everyone had left, first elder Zhu Li turned and helplessly shook his head at Lin Dong and Little Marten. Clearly, he was somewhat speechless at the knack these few young fellows had with regards to getting into trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These people actually dare to snatch something that belongs to us. Grandpa Marten is already kind to not have killed them.” Little Marten curled his lips as an ominous glint flashed within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snatch something of yours?” First elder Zhu Li was a little stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong shrugged his shoulder. He did not hide anything and recounted the matter of the Darkness Saint Tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is actually the Darkness Saint Tiger…” First elder Zhu Li and Liu Qing were clearly a little amazed after hearing what Lin Dong had said and took another glance at Little Flame by the side. They finally understood why the three great Tiger tribes dared to take such a risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a fateful encounter. The Darkness Saint Tiger tribe has basically completely disappeared from this world. The Darkness Saint Tiger bloodline that you obtained earlier might be the last one there is.” First elder Zhu Li sighed. His expression was one of pity and regret. After all, the Darkness Saint Tiger tribe was not weaker than their Dragon tribe during those ancient times. However, it had almost went extinct after the great calamity back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hopefully, the last bloodline of the Darkness Saint Tiger will allow the former overlord tribe to rise again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame nodded as he closed his fist over his chest. He could sense that the black white bead, which he had swallowed, was slowly dissolving. An ancient and powerful bloodline was spreading a little at a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bloodline was even greater than his Heavenly Devil Tiger tribe bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. We should head for the Devouring Divine Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled and patted Little Flame’s shoulder. They had wasted quite a lot of time in this place. Fortunately, with the faint connection from the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, he could sense the rough position of the Devouring Divine Palace.</span></p>

Their expressions were filled with anticipation. It was likely that all of them felt a great curiosity towards the legendary Devouring Master.</span></p>

His body turned into a ray of light that headed straight towards the depths of the shattered space while Little Marten and the others followed closely behind. This sight was exceptionally spectacular.</span></p>

His eyes were focused intently on the depths of the shattered space. Great excitement seemed to flicker deep within those pitch-black eyes.</span></p>

Most of them were quite well known in the Demon Region. However, they appeared to be quite wary when they saw Lin Dong’s group. After all, this lineup was very intimidating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong did not concern himself with this and merely raised his speed to the limit. They continued in this manner for around an hour, before his body suddenly stilled. He could feel the Devouring Ancestral Symbol inside his body tremble violently at this moment.</span></p>

At the end of their sights stood a lone black mountain on a barren plains. The lone mountain was precipitous and there were no paths leading up to its peak.</span></p>

It was as though it had stood there since the beginning of time.</span></p>

It was there that a peak ultimate expert from that ancient era had died.</span></p>

Even those cruel Yimo felt fear towards this ultimate expert.</span></p>

His body trembled slightly at this moment. It was possible for him to feel the sorrowful howls from the Devouring Ancestral Symbol in his body at this moment.</span></p>

However, he slowly suppressed it a moment later. This was because he could detect hurried wind sounds behind him.</span></p>
