The Spatial Ancestral Symbol, which suddenly appeared out of nowhere, had clearly taken him by surprise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is now without a doubt that Yuan Gate is in cahoots with the Yimo. In that case, how did the three great heads of Yuan Gate control the Spatial Ancestral Symbol?” Lin Dong muttered. Typically speaking, the Ancestral Symbols have extremely powerful restraining properties against the Yimo. Therefore, as long as there was demonic aura within one’s body, the Ancestral Symbols would resist with their full strength. As such, much less needed to be said about controlling them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Dong clearly felt that previous fluctuation and knew that it was indeed the strength of the Ancestral Symbol. Moreover, the fact that the large silver hand could easily penetrate through space, was also something that could only be accomplished by the Spatial Ancestral Symbol. In fact, even a peak level Reincarnation stage expert, would have difficulties penetrating through space without leaving any traces behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan was also frowning while she gently shook her head. Evidently, she was also uncertain about how Yuan Gate managed to control the Spatial Ancestral Symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it. I don’t care what techniques they used. However, a divine item like an Ancestral Symbol must not land in their hands.” With a faint smile, a cold glint flashed across Lin Dong’s dark black eyes as he said, “We will snatch the Spatial Ancestral Symbol after finishing off those three old dogs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan nodded. Her icy blue eyes suddenly glanced into the distance before she lifted her icy blue hair over her earlobe. Meanwhile, there was an unknown expression on her chilly face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the spot where she glanced at, there was also another great beauty, who seemed to have been forged from the life essence of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong also detected her line of sight. Soon after, his face, which remained impassive even when up against the great heads of Yuan Gate, suddenly became uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, there was indeed an awkward relationship between the three of them. Lin Dong and Ling Qingzhu had spent an intimate night together before. Moreover, a major factor why he chose to leave the small Great Yan Empire many years ago, was because he wanted to chase after this person, who had once bloomed like an epiphyllum flower in his life. Ling Qingzhu was prideful, while Lin Dong was stubborn. Back then, because he looked up to her, he wanted to surpass her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, Lin Dong had no choice but to admit that there was a strong desire to conquer Ling Qingzhu deep within his heart. Meanwhile, the seed of this desire was planted back at that lonely mountain top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Underlying his desire to conquer her, was overbearing pride that belonged to a man. Therefore, he did not know whether he could remain calm if Ling Qingzhu was lying in the arms of another man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ridiculous deed that they did back then, left an extremely deep impression on both of their hearts and it could never be erased. This was something that neither of them could deny.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan was someone Lin Dong subsequently met. With regards to her various contributions and how long she spent waiting for him, even if Lin Dong was a cold hearted individual, he could never forget about it. In fact, even up till today, whenever he thought about the scenes back at the Unique Devil City, his heart still aches gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That lovely and lively girl had transformed into this icy beauty partly because of him. Meanwhile, the heartache and pain that she suffered as her personality changed, was perhaps something that even Ying Huanhuan was not clearly aware of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there was no doubt that both ladies were outstanding. One was the most outstanding disciple Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace ever had, while the other was actually the reincarnator of the Ice Master. As such, the both of them were extremely prideful. Of course, when these two dazzling ladies clashed, it was clearly impossible for either one of them to back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Lin Dong felt a headache.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Charge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Lin Dong was fretting over this matter, earthshaking battle cries sounded from below. Immediately, the disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace charged towards the disciples from Yuan Gate. After losing most of their elders, those Yuan Gate disciples were clearly dispirited. Hence, miserable cries rung continuously across the sky as they were being hunted by the disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no concept of cruelty at this moment. Yuan Gate was the one who started the war and they naturally had to pay a price for doing so. Moreover, these Yuan Gate disciples were all corrupted by the demonic aura. Therefore, at this rate, it was likely that they would slowly lose their minds and turn into human beasts, who only know how to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle cries continued for a long time. After which, corpses belonging to the disciples from Yuan Gate covered the entire mountain range. Those who managed to survive through sheer luck, fled miserably in all directions and they were no longer as fearsome as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Lin Dong!” At afar, Su Ruo waved her small hand in Lin Dong’s direction. Meanwhile, her small face appeared flush from excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong opened his stride and walked towards her upon seeing this. Behind him, Ying Huanhuan hesitated for a moment before she bit her red lips and followed him at a leisurely pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Lin Dong, you aren’t injured, are you?” Su Ruo looked at Lin Dong, who had landed in front of him. Then, she carefully surveyed him before uttering those words with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, there were countless disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace gathered around them. These people were all staring curiously at Lin Dong with gratitude in their eyes. After all, if Lin Dong and his men did not show up and assist them today, their Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace would have became an entry in the history book of the Eastern Xuan Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled as he shook his head. After which, he looked towards the cool fairy like Ling Qingzhu, who was dressed in white and standing behind Su Ruo. When Ling Qingzhu detected this, she tilted her head, only to look at Ying Huanhuan, who was standing behind Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air seemingly solidified the instant those two ladies looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of their demeanors were somewhat icy cold. However, due to Ying Huanhuan’s constitution, the cold air around her was unusually chilly. On the other hand, Ling Qingzhu’s chill originated from her demeanor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two ladies were the center of attention no matter where they were. However, when they were placed together, their respective radiance and coldness seemed to be in contrast with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This area seemed to have fallen within the unique charms of those two ladies. This caused the surrounding disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace to shut their mouths, while their eyes continuously oscillated between the two of them. After which, they glanced at Lin Dong, who was standing between them. Some sensitive individuals even lifted their brows, before they cast an envious and pitiful look towards Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten, first elder Zhu Li and the rest also hurried over. When they saw this strange atmosphere, they smirked involuntarily. Meanwhile, they looked at Lin Dong with a playful expression in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strange atmosphere continued. However, both Ying Huanhuan and Ling Qingzhu did not speak up. Finally, Lin Dong could only cough softly in order to break the silence. After which, he glanced at the damaged Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace before he pondered and asked, “Where is the palace master?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher has died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim expression flashed across Ling Qingzhu’s autumn water like eyes, before she continued, “The elders are all seriously injured. Our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace has suffered serious losses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong sighed softly. This was something that was unavoidable. After all, the current Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace was indeed unable to put up much of a resistance against Yuan Gate. In fact, had they arrived a little later, it was likely that Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace would have suffered even more severe losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This time around… On behalf of every disciple from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, I would like to thank you, your friends from Dao Sect, and elders from another region.” Ling Qingzhu softly said.</span></p>

Then, he quickly shook his head and said, “Forget it. You young fellows should have a chat. An old man like me is unable to handle this tense atmosphere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around and left after uttering those words. Little Marten and the rest also grinned before they left. Following which, the surrounding disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace also left in small groups. However, they continued to cast some curious glances over.</span></p>

After which, she smiled at Ling Qingzhu and extended her delicate hand, “Ying Huanhuan from Dao Sect. I believe that we have met before.”</span></p>

As of now, there is likely no one in the entire Eastern Xuan Region who doesn’t know who Miss Huanhuan is.” There was also a rarely seen smile on Ling Qingzhu’s pretty face. Then, she extended her hand before she gently shook Ying Huanhuan’s hand. It seems like these two prideful individuals were unwilling to submit in front of the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The both of you should have a chat.” Ying Huanhuan did not say anything more. Instead, she turned and stared at Lin Dong. After which, with a much gentler tone, she said, “Let’s return to Dao Sect after you are done. I will be waiting for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She did not linger on after uttering those words.

Finally, she remarked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You went to the Great Yan Empire? My mother said that she has met you before.” Lin Dong smiled. He stared at Ling Qingzhu before he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu nodded in a seemingly calm manner. However, her fair face was slightly flushed as she said, “It just so happens that I went to the Great Yan Empire to do something. After which, I decided to visit your parents as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She continued to speak in a calm manner. However, there were tiny ripples in her eyes, which typically held no emotions. That was because she knew that her excuse was simply too far fetched.</span></p>

Her demeanor caused one’s bones to soften. After which, she raised her brow, before she questioned him, “Both of us?”</span></p>

His short sentence allowed her to understand just how much hard work this young man in front of her, had put in over the last three years. Others had only witnessed his glory. However, no one knew how many times he lingered between life and death in order to obtain this strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, you were very powerful three years ago.”</span></p>

The scene from three years ago flashed within her mind. A blood covered skinny man holding onto a long spear, did not display the slightest fear even when up against the three great heads of Yuan Gate. His courage and charisma caused the expressions of countless people to change, even including hers.</span></p>
