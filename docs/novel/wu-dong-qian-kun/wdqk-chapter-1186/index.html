After which, her hands were trembling as she extended her hand and gently touched Lin Dong’s face. Her careful demeanor was as though she was afraid that the scene in front of her, was merely a hallucination before death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong stood with a smile as he allowed Liu Yan’s somewhat icy cold hand to touch his face. The instant they touched, the blood connection between them caused his heart to tremble gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is you… Dong'er, you are alive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warmth which entered her hand, caused Liu Yan to completely recover her senses. Immediately, great joy surged onto her face. After which, she hugged Lin Dong violently before she cried continuously. After all, no one knew how badly her heart ached when she received news that Lin Dong was forced to flee from the Eastern Xuan Region by the Yuan Gate, and that no one knew if he was dead or alive. Fortunately, she subsequently received news that Lin Dong was alive and this helped to turn things around. Nevertheless, her heart still felt like it was being pierced by countless needles, when she thought of the hardships that Lin Dong must be suffering while roaming out in the world all by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong hugged Liu Yan tightly as he gently leaned on her shoulder. His dark black eyes, which never revealed the slightest bit of fear when up against any perilous life and death situations, had some tears gathering within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, I am well.”</span></p>

Then, he lifted his head to look at Lin Xiao, who was standing beside Liu Yan. Currently, the latter’s typically stern face was also filled with joy. However, he forcefully held back most of his emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled at Lin Xiao and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humph, little brat, to think that you actually remember that you have a father. It has been so many years since you left, yet you never bothered to tell us how you were doing.” Lin Xiao’s face became stern as he coldly chided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What nonsense are you saying. Dong'er has suffered tremendously in the outside world. What gives you the right to criticise him?” Liu Yan immediately turned around and chided furiously, when she heard his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though she was typically warm and friendly, she was just like a tigress protecting her cub now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Xiao laughed dryly. He looked at Lin Dong’s smiling face before his eyes involuntarily reddened. “Little fellow, you are as stubborn as always. Back then, I told you that you can always come back home when you grow tired outside. I might not be as capable as you, however, I will never let you suffer as long as I am around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, since when did you become such a sentimental person?” Even with Lin Dong’s character, he still felt his nose twitch when he heard Lin Xiao’s words. Only in front of them, was he once again that tender youth from Qingyang Town, and not some elite top notch expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Xiao smilingly chided him. After which, he quickly took a step to the side and said, “Little brat, your grandfather is here. Why aren’t you greeting him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, there is no need to rush. This young fellow has just returned. Let him speak to his mother first.” Lin Zhentian laughed out loud. Previously, he had mostly remained silent. However, as of now, his demeanor had changed completely. In fact, some tears were glimmering in his elderly eyes as he stared at Lin Dong. Meanwhile, his face was filled with pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa, despite your age, you are as fit as always.” Lin Dong looked at Lin Zhentian and laughed. Back then, this old man was the most authoritative figure in his family and even he, was a little afraid of the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Zhentian laughed out loud. Then, he took a step forward and patted Lin Dong’s shoulders heavily, before he said with some excitement, “Well done. Little fellow, you are the pride of our Lin Family!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why their Lin Family enjoyed such a high status in Great Yan Empire, and why even the clan head of the main clan had to treat them with utmost respect, was all because of Lin Dong’s efforts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone on the city walls had gradually recovered their senses at this moment. When they saw the skinny young man standing in front of Lin Xiao, all of them turned to look at each other. After all, many people here knew who Lin Dong was. Several years ago, Lin Dong was merely a youth when he left Great Yan Empire to participate in the Hundred Empire War. However, when he returned, that young man now had the makings of a grandmaster. In fact, he easily blocked the attack from a Samsara stage expert previously. Hence, just how frightening must he be, in order for him to do so?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, it is actually young brother Lin Dong who has saved all of us. On behalf of my Great Yan Empire, allow me to thank you.” Mo Jingtian quickly stepped forward, cupped his hands together before he smilingly said. His smile even appeared slightly respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, strength reigns supreme in this world. In fact, his title as the head of the royal family was likely worthless in the eyes of the current Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled back at him. After which, he looked at the young man behind Mo Jingtian and laughed, “Brother Mo Ling, how’s life in Dao Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ling had an excited expression as he quickly nodded. Then, his heart churned as he thought of how they had supported each other back when they participated in the Hundred Empire War together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you are martial senior Lin Dong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A timid voice was emitted from behind Mo Ling. Lin Dong lifted his head and saw that it came from a green clothed young lady. This young lady was quite pretty and she had a delicate figure. In fact, she was a little beauty. However, there seemed to be wild heat suring within the latter’s big eyes currently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Anran. Haha, she is also a disciple of our Desolate Hall and she has always worshiped you. Of course, I’m afraid that there isn’t a single disciple in Dao Sect who does not worship you. In fact, there will likely be a huge uproar if they know that you have returned.” Mo Ling laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Dong thought of his martial brothers back at the Desolate Hall, warmth rose in his heart. Then, he smiled towards Anran. When she saw his smile, her pretty small face was so excited that it turned red. Entangling her small hands together, she no longer looked as cheeky as she usually did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xia, it has been a while since we met. How are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s attention shifted towards the gray robed blind old man behind. Then, he softly laughed. He had frequently played chess with elder Xia back at Dao Sect and had also received many pointers from him. Hence, Lin Dong was extremely respectful towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You little fellow…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xia’s white eyes looked at Lin Dong, before a pleased smile appeared on his face. That young man back then had unknowingly grown until he reached a level, whereby even he could not hope to touch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The originally tensed and despairing atmosphere on the city walls had also stealthily disappeared. Instead, their faces were filled with joy as they secretly looked at that skinny young man. Ever since the latter showed up, he did not even bother to glance at his enemy in the distance. Hence, his demeanor caused hope to rise in their hearts, which were previously filled with despair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I know who you are? I am an elder of Yuan Gate, Zhao Kui. I hope that this young friend will not randomly intervene. Otherwise, you may end up creating unnecessary problems for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the distant sky, Zhao Kui’s eyes stared menacingly at that figure, who was on the city walls. His deep cry was like a thunder roar, as it resounded across the sky.</span></p>
