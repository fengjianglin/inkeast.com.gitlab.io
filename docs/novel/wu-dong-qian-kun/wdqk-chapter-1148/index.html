 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crisis facing the Celestial Demon Marten tribe was finally over after the two Yimo kings left. Nonetheless, this matter had clearly caused a huge commotion within the tribe. As a result, the security of the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe also became extremely tight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the elites of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, even formed small investigation units to comb the area within a five hundred kilometre radius of their tribe. Following which, anything that came into contact with the demonic aura was completely exterminated. Clearly, they were greatly shocked by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flower seeds that were buried in the mountains. After all, this crisis had almost severely damaged their Celestial Demon Marten tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a couple of days’ time, the top experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who were undergoing a cultivation seclusion in the Heavenly Cave, all began to awaken. Then, they were all shocked and terrified when they learnt about the crisis, as well as the trap placed in the Heavenly Cave. After all, if not for Lin Dong, it was likely that most of them would have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The upper echelon of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe were undoubtedly extremely furious over this matter. Hence, it was likely that things would not end well for Hao Jiuyou. However, Lin Dong did not care about this. As he sustained terrible internal injuries, he had to recuperate for a total of ten days in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, before he was able to return to his usual form.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong clearly played an important role during this crisis. If he had not snuck into the Heavenly Cave and rescued the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader, and if he had not risked his life to delay Hao Jiuyou after no one else in the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe was available after being trapped by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers, it was likely that the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would have suffered great deaths and huge losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this, that Lin Dong was able to sense the gratitude and admiration in the eyes of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe members, while he was recuperating within the tribe. The Celestial Demon Marten tribe members were typically proud and arrogant individuals. This was something that one could tell by using Little Marten as an example. Hence, it was no easy task for someone, especially a human, to earn their respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was not merely limited to ordinary tribe members. In fact, even those top experts, who were in a cultivation seclusion within the Heavenly Cave, felt grateful towards him after they learnt that he had snuck into the Heavenly Cave and helped them to remove the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. As a result, over the next few days, Lin Dong slowly became irritated with their stares. Hence, he eventually chose to seclude himself and recuperate, in order to regain some peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the flow of time, the tense atmosphere within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe also began to relax as an increasing number of top experts left their seclusion. After all, the reason why the Celestial Demon Marten tribe was forced into such a sorry state, was because the tribe temporarily lacked powerful individuals. Moreover, with the spy Hao Jiuyou helping them from the inside, it allowed the Yimo to take advantage of them. Nonetheless, having suffered such a huge loss, the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would definitely not make the same mistake again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Celestial Demon Marten tribe got serious, the foundation that was only possessed by the four overlord tribes, was completely displayed. If the Heaven Illusion King duo were to attack again, it was likely that they would only end up suffering...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong finally made a complete recovery as the atmosphere within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe gradually begun to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong sat on the edge of a cliff, in front of a quiet bamboo house located on a mountaintop. If one was to look down from this place, it would be possible for one to see the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe. At this moment, not only was the tribe guarding formation activated, but there were also many powerful guards frequently patrolling the sky. However, when those guards saw Lin Dong, who was seated at the edge of the cliff, they would slow down and smilingly cup their hands towards him, before they left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he stared at the departing guards, Lin Dong smiled as well. Then, he stretched his lazy waist before he looked at the azure sky. Even up till now, the intense battle that took place ten days ago was still playing in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Despite having risked it all, I am still unable to kill a genuine Samsara stage expert…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong lowered his head and looked at his somewhat fair and long hands. Then, he helplessly curled his lips. He had basically unleashed every technique in the fight against Hao Jiuyou. Nonetheless, he was still unable to kill the latter. This caused him to secretly sigh. It seems like there was truly a huge gap between Profound Death stage and Samsara stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As of now, he was able to pose a threat to a Samsara stage expert. However, he would have difficulties gaining the upper hand if they were to engage in a life and death battle. Moreover, he could not allow the fight to drag on because of his limited strength. That was his fatal weakness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, increasing his own strength was still the best option.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If it is Yuan Power, it will still be difficult to make up for this huge gap even if I advance to the perfect Profound Death stage… Therefore, I can only turn to Mental Energy.” Lin Dong muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Lin Dong was at the peak of the advance Profound Death stage and he was only one step away from the perfect Profound Death stage, However, even if he managed to make this step, it would not grant him the ability to kill a Samsara stage expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Lin Dong still had another path to choose from. It was Mental Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Mental Energy cultivation was presently at the peak of the advance Divine Symbol Master level and his Mental Energy could match up to a peak perfect Profound Death stage expert. If he took another step, he would reach the legendary Symbol Grandmaster level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a watershed level for Mental Energy practitioners. Once one stepped into this level, the might of one’s Mental Energy would be completely on display. At that time, the power displayed by a Symbol Grandmaster will definitely exceed that of an ordinary Samsara stage expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lin Dong wanted to match up to a Samsara stage expert in a short period of time, he could only do so by strengthening his Mental Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In order to advance to the Symbol Grandmaster level… the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers are critical…” Lin Dong softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, the things that you want are here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A familiar laughter was transmitted from behind just as Lin Dong’s voice sounded. He turned around and saw Little Marten, who had unknowingly appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten waved his sleeve before many jade boxes flew forth. After which, they landed heavily on the ground. Those jade boxes were all covered with mysterious symbols. Clearly, it was to seal the items within.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers that you asked for. There are a total of sixty-nine of them. Must you use these dangerous items for your training? You should also be aware of just how terrifying these creatures are, and even my father could not handle them. You…” Little Marten frowned. Although the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers have all been sealed, his eyes still contained great fear when he looked at those jade boxes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax, I won’t do anything foolish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled. After which, he looked at the sixty-nine jade boxes with joyous eyes. Then, he clenched his hand before the Ancestor Stone appeared. It flickered before it sucked all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I told father that you are going to use these Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers for your training. He has asked you to go to the Heavenly Cave to seclude yourself. Moreover, he will personally lead some elders and stand guard for you. If any mishaps occur, he will intervene and rescue you.” Little Marten said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, please help me to thank the tribe leader.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Lin Dong was startled, he did not reject the offer. Although Yan didn’t specify, Lin Dong felt that it was definitely going to be fraught with danger to use the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers to achieve a breakthrough in his Mental Energy cultivation. Therefore, if the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe was willing to assist him, it would be an additional form of insurance for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have done a huge favour for our Celestial Demon Marten tribe and everyone in the tribe is grateful towards you. This little favour is hardly worth mentioning.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew it.”</span></p>

Instead, all he did was to nod his head before he said, &nbsp;“I will take you to the Heavenly Cave. There is no need for you to worry about anything during your seclusion. I know that you and Little Flame have united the Beast War Region and established the Four Titans Palace. Relax, I will dispatch some members to help him to keep everything in check. It is likely that no one will dare to come and create trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong nodded before he clenched the Ancestor Stone tightly. This subsequent act would determine whether he could advance into the Symbol Grandmaster level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After making up his mind, Lin Dong did not wait any longer. Both of them directly hurried to the deepest part of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Over a dozen minutes later, they appeared outside of the Heavenly Cave. Currently, the security in this place had became even tighter. Moreover, Lin Dong also saw the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe as well as first elder Zhu Li waiting over there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young friend Lin Dong, we have thoroughly combed the Heavenly Cave and there are definitely no hidden threats within. You can undergo a cultivation seclusion with a peace of mind.” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader smilingly said when he saw Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will have to trouble you, tribe leader.” Lin Dong cupped his hands together and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. I will let Little Marten take you in. We will be standing guard outside.” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe waved his large hand and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong nodded. Without further ado, he exchanged glances with Little Marten before they directly rushed into the Heavenly Cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This young friend Lin Dong is indeed extraordinary. Not only does he possess the Ancestor Stone, which is ranked second on the Ancient Divine Object Ranking, but he also possess the Primal Dragon Bone. That is something that was only possessed by the fearsome legendary person, who had once unified the entire Demonic Beast World.” Zhu Li looked at Lin Dong, who had disappeared into the Heavenly Cave, before he involuntarily praised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like Ah Diao has found an extremely good brother.”</span></p>

Promptly, he narrowed his eyes before he said, “However, he is actually planning to use the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers to break into the Symbol Grandmaster level. That is something unheard of. Observe him carefully. He has done a huge favour for our Celestial Demon Marten tribe and our reputation will be completely lost if anything happens to him here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, tribe leader, please be rest assured. I have already informed the person in the deepest part of the cave and he will watch over Lin Dong.” Zhu Li smilingly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe sighed in relief upon hearing this. After which, he waved his hand before the experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe scattered off and surrounded the cave, ensuring that nothing could get by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　……</span></p>

That air was filled with the scent of sandalwood. After which, he clenched his hand before the Ancestor Stone appeared. Soon after, his low voice echoed across the cave.</span></p>
