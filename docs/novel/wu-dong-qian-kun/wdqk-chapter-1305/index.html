It was as if his consciousness had fallen into an endless darkness. Howls akin to those of a suffering wild beast faintly echoed within this darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unclear how long these howls continued, before they finally started to gradually weaken as if the owner of the howls had exhausted all of his energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After an unknown period of time, a magnificent radiance suddenly exploded within the darkness and wrapped around the consciousness floating inside it. This radiance was like countless images as it flickered past. Every image seemed to be a Reincarnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s mind was forcibly pulled into these Reincarnation vortexes. Subsequently, he completely lost consciousness. Such a feeling was even more frightening than when he was taking on the three Reincarnation Tribulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wheel of reincarnation turned as a certain consciousness finally fully submerged within it, unable to free itself. His memories seemed to be stripped away as new memories took over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　……</span></p>

He still worked hard in his cultivation to obtain justice for his father. However, he did not have the Ancestral Stone this time, and was merely an ordinary young man of the Lin Family that was dedicated to the family.</span></p>

Although he made the Lin Family the strongest family in Qingyang Town through his efforts, his hatred towards Lin Langtian was leaked, hence drawing killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood and fire enveloped the Lin Family.</span></p>

As fresh blood sprayed, she did her best to shout at the young man nearby who was watching this disaster in a dazed manner, “Dong’er, quickly escape!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thick fear surged in his heart. He watched as a tall and thin man with a handsome face slowly walked over. The longsword in this man’s hands was still dripping with the blood of his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you the Lin Dong who wanted to take revenge on me?” The handsome man stood before Lin Dong. A faint mocking expression appeared on his face, while his gaze seemed as if he was looking down at an ant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will kill you!”</span></p>

Deeply rooted hatred surged in his heart as he howled and charged at Lin Langtian. However, all he saw was the cold and mocking smile on the latter’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lowly member of the branch family, you cannot even tell the difference between up and down. Staying in this world will only tarnish the name of my Lin Clan.”</span></p>

Soon after, a sharp sword swept forth and pierced his neck without the slightest hesitation. Fresh blood sprayed as he powerlessly fell to the ground. In a pool of his own blood, he saw Lin Xiao, Lin Zhentian and the rest kneeling nearby. Subsequently, that same sharp sword cut through their necks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heads fell one after another. Those widely opened eyes were filled with feelings of unresignment and despair.</span></p>

In the end, he faded together with his endless remorse.</span></p>

His talent was outstanding and in the end, he allowed the Lin Family to return to the Lin Clan through his efforts. Moreover, he ultimately also became the most dazzling person in the Lin Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under his management, the Lin Clan became the most powerful clan in the Great Yan Empire, while he too became the empire’s number one practitioner.</span></p>

However, the instant darkness filled his sights, he faintly felt that he seemed to have lost the most important thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　……</span></p>

One life after another passed as if it would never end. Lin Dong’s consciousness fell into this Reincarnation and he could no longer find his true self.</span></p>

He had been subjected to the myriad shapes and forms of life.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only when each life reached its end, did he finally feel as if he was still unable to find something. Similarly, he had not found his true self.</span></p>

However, it was merely a glimpse, and that preposterous night of passion in the stone tomb did not occur. The latter was still the unreachable fairy that seemed to have descended from the heavens, while he were merely one of the countless people who could only look up to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that life, he was exceptionally ordinary. He achieved nothing and his life gloomily reached its end.</span></p>

After experiencing an unknown number of reincarnations, a certain consciousness grew more and more murky, as if it would continue to fall in this manner for an eternity.</span></p>

However, when their eyes met within the crowd, he seemed to faintly tremble for a moment as indescribable feelings filled his heart.</span></p>

He started to separate himself from the ordinary, and distinguish himself from amongst the Dao Sect disciples. As his reputation amongst the Dao Sect disciples grew greater and greater, those pretty eyes that quietly observed him grew increasingly bright.</span></p>

As the wind blew past, a fragrance immediately filled the area.</span></p>

He looked to his front, where the graceful and soft figure of a young lady was skillfully dancing. Flowers filled the sky and seemed to dance along with the twisting of her waist as they gathered around her. The young lady’s clear as a silver bell like laughter was the most beautiful sound in this world.</span></p>
