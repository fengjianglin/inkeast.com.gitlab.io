 <p>Chapter 1085: Each Displaying Their Own Techniques</p>
 <p>Humm humm!</p>
 <p>A brilliant golden light circle continuously rotated. Objects wrapped in beams of light rapidly shot out one after another as if they were freebies, sparking numerous cruel and bloody battles.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s gaze slowly began to withdraw from the golden light circle. There was some interest deep within his eyes. He had detected a relatively strong ripple when his Mental Energy invaded the golden light circle earlier.</p>
 <p>“Have those three fellows also discovered it? They are indeed worthy of being Samsara stage experts.”</p>
 <p>However, while Lin Dong withdrew his eyes, he sensed the bodies of the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio suddenly freeze as excitement rose on their faces. Clearly, they had also used their own methods to find certain divine objects with the most powerful ripples within the golden light circle.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, how was it?” Little Flame by the side inquired. Divine Item Mountain Range was currently in a frenzy. That golden light circle continuously spit out treasures, causing the eyes of many to be filled with desire.</p>
 <p>“Let’s wait and see.” Lin Dong narrowed his eyes and softly said. It was clearly inappropriate to make their move at such a time.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio exchanged a glance with each other after Lin Dong’s voice sounded. Soon after, the Ghost Condor Demon Commander laughed loudly. “Since all of you are not going to make your moves, allow me to be the first to do so!”</p>
 <p>Swish!</p>
 <p>A golden band of light had already swiftly shot out from his hand, heading straight into the golden light circle.</p>
 <p>The gazes of the many experts in Divine Item Mountain Range hurriedly gathered upon seeing the Ghost Condor Demon Commander take action. They clearly understood that these three Demon Commanders would not act unless they saw a worthy target. Since the Ghost Condor Demon Commander had chosen to act, there was definitely something that had caught his eyes. They were curious to find out what level this divine object had to be in order to catch the eye of one of the three great Demon Commanders.</p>
 <p>The Ghost Condor Demon Commander revealed the astonishing power of a Samsara stage expert the moment he acted. The band of golden light was akin to an extremely solid golden rod as it shot into the golden light circle. After which, everyone watched as the band of golden light shuttled back and forth within the rapidly rotating light circle. It was clearly searching for its target.</p>
 <p>The Ghost Condor Demon Commander had already chosen his target. Hence, this search only lasted for a moment before the golden light pounced like a viper. Subsequently, it twined around a rapidly spinning black light.</p>
 <p>“Caught it!”</p>
 <p>Joy instantly surged on the Ghost Condor Demon Commander’s face. However, his expression quickly changed. Everyone felt an unusually wild and violent resistance sweep out from the golden light circle, causing it to tremble intensely.</p>
 <p>The resistance of this big catch seemed to be relatively intense.</p>
 <p>The expression in the Ghost Condor Demon Commander’s eyes changed when he felt this powerful resistance. A sharp cry was emitted as vast and mighty Yuan Power swept out from his hand in an attempt to forcibly drag out the grabbed divine object.</p>
 <p>Buzz buzz!</p>
 <p>The golden band of light became extremely taunt. Those present could feel the frightening face-off contained under this tautness.</p>
 <p>The rotation speed of the golden light circle started to increase at this moment as a frightening pulling force erupted from it. It pulled at the Yuan Power of the Ghost Condor Demon Commander until it showed signs of becoming somewhat disorderly.</p>
 <p>“He won’t be able to grab hold of that object!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes hardened. Surprise appeared in them as he stared at the cluster of black light within the golden light circle. It seemed that this divine object was quite powerful. Otherwise, it would not be able to force a Samsara stage expert into such a tight spot even with the interference of the Mysterious Divine Palace.</p>
 <p>This face-off continued for a couple of minutes. However, that golden band of light began to show signs of fading due to the pulling forces. It was clearly unable to withstand the powerful forces.</p>
 <p>“Damnit!”</p>
 <p>The expression of the Ghost Condor Demon Commander immediately changed upon seeing this. He clenched his teeth and his hand jerked in a decisive manner. The golden band of light gave up on the troublesome black cluster of light. With a pull, the band of light flew backwards, bringing out a red light cluster with it...</p>
 <p>The Ghost Condor Demon Commander grabbed the red light cluster. The light surrounding it disappeared as it turned into a red ruler. Scorching heat waves rippled from it. It was obviously a rather powerful divine object. However, the expression of the Ghost Condor Demon Commander was quite ugly when he saw it. He could feel that the divine object in his hand did not belong on the Ancient Divine Object Ranking...</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, Ghost Condor, it seems like you have failed.” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander and the Golden Ape Demon Commander burst out in laughter upon seeing this. Their laughter contained a gloating tone.</p>
 <p>Ghost Condor had a dark expression as he laughed coldly, “Why don’t you give it a try. This thing is even more difficult to subdue than the Nine Sky Heavy Mountain. It likely possess quite a high ranking on the Divine Object Ranking.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander duo’s faces twitched slightly as intense greed surged from deep within their eyes. The Nine Sky Heavy Mountain was ranked thirty two on the Divine Object Ranking. Just how strong was this thing for it to have a higher ranking?</p>
 <p>“Let me try!”</p>
 <p>The Golden Ape Demon Commander grinned. He did not say anything unnecessary as his hand shook and a golden band of light shot into the golden light circle.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s expression was calm as he watched this scene. Soon after, he crossed his long fingers. The result will very quickly be out…</p>
 <p>His estimate was not wrong. In a mere five minutes, the expression of the Golden Ape Demon Commander became increasingly grave. He endured for another five minutes as he felt the resistance grow stronger and stronger. In the end, all he could do was unwillingly give up like Ghost Condor had and retrieve another divine object instead. However, it was obvious that he was dissatisfied with the divine object that he had obtained.</p>
 <p>At this moment, many secretly shocked gazes looked over from Divine Item Mountain Range. Evidently, the failure of both the Ghost Condor Demon Commander and the Golden Ape Demon Commander had been seen by them. Just what level was this divine object at that it could not be subdued by these two Samsara stage experts?</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander did not mock them after seeing that even the Golden Ape Demon Commander had failed. His eyes became a little more serious. He was well aware of the strength of those two. If they were helpless against that thing, it was likely that he would not fare any better against it…</p>
 <p>“That divine object is likely able to enter the top twenty five positions on the Divine Object Ranking…”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander clenched his teeth. He took a step forward as the Ancient Divine Tablet in his hand turned into a golden band of light that ferociously shot into the golden light circle.</p>
 <p>Countless pairs of eyes were focused on him. Several people had even gradually removed themselves from the other fights.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong narrowed his eyes as he observed. An undetectable ridicule was lifted from the corners of his mouth a moment later. This Heaven Dragon Demon Commander would likely have to return empty handed this time around.</p>
 <p>As time flowed, everyone saw the expression of the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander gradually turn ugly. The golden band of light also gradually faded under the pulling of the two wild and violent forces.</p>
 <p>However, this Heaven Dragon Demon Commander was quite stubborn. He was unwilling to stop even at this moment. Hence a ‘bang’ was heard as the golden band of light was torn apart. This time around, he had truly returned empty handed. He had not even obtained a consolation divine object.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>When the band of light broke, the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s expression turned a furious shade of green as he involuntarily cursed.</p>
 <p>Everyone around involuntarily shook their heads in pity after seeing that even the three great Demon Commanders had failed. Soon after, curiosity rose in their hearts. All of them really wanted to know just what object could make these three Samsara stage experts so helpless.</p>
 <p>“Little Flame, there is no need to be anxious regardless of what happens later on. I have my own solution.” Lin Dong smiled a little. After which, he looked at Little Flame beside him and softly said.</p>
 <p>“Does big brother also intend to target that item?” Little Flame was startled. Chen Tong and the others by the side were also stunned as they looked at Lin Dong. After all, even the three great Demon Commanders had failed earlier.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong smiled and nodded but did not elaborate. All he did was to stare intently at the golden light circle with his black eyes.</p>
 <p>Little Flame nodded upon seeing this. He always had great confidence in Lin Dong. After all, he could succeed where others could not.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong stepped forward after speaking. Subsequently, he appeared in the sky under the attention of everyone in the mountains. His appearance immediately attracted the gazes of many pairs of eyes. They clearly had quite a deep impression of this person who had dared to challenge the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander earlier. Moreover, from the looks of it, it seemed that he was about to make his move.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander glanced at Lin Dong as the corners of his mouth curled downwards. There were expressions of amusement in the eyes of the Golden Ape Demon Commander and the Ghost Condor Demon Commander. Did this fellow really intend to give it a try?</p>
 <p>Lin Dong ignored the various gazes on him as he stared at the golden light circle. With a clench of his hand, an ancient tablet flashed and appeared. Immediately, a golden light band reached out from it.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s hand jerked as the golden light band shot forward. Subsequently, it entered the golden circle of light. Soon after, the light band flashed and it actually rushed towards the most formidable black light cluster.</p>
 <p>Uproar.</p>
 <p>An uproar spread across the place. Lin Dong was indeed aiming for that item. However, where did his confidence come from? Even the three Samsara stage experts were unable to succeed.</p>
 <p>The Golden Ape Demon Commander and the Ghost Condor Demon Commander frowned. Their fear of Lin Dong originated from the mysterious puppet at the latter’s side. However, Lin Dong was currently relying on his own strength in an attempt to subdue a divine object which they could do nothing about. This undoubtedly appeared as though he was inviting humiliation.</p>
 <p>“You are really reckless.”</p>
 <p>The expression of the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander was dark as a cold chuckle was emitted through his teeth. Was he not afraid of death due to overeating with such a huge appetite?</p>
 <p>Lin Dong did not have the time to bother about them. His black eyes stared intently at the rotating golden circle of light. There seemed to be a warm and strange white light slowly rising from the depths of his eyes.</p>
