Meanwhile, rich disbelief and shock surged within their eyes.</span></p>

How is this possible?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> </span></p>

However, there were hardly any fluctuations within his eyes. This was because he knew that the person standing in front of him merely had the same looks as Lin Langtian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, this is only because I detected that your emotions had a violent reaction towards this man…” The Yimo Emperor smiled. Then, he looked at his own body before he smilingly said, “It seems like using this appearance had quite a huge impact on all of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your appearance truly gives me the impulse to kill you for the second time.” Lin Dong said in a faint voice. Although Lin Langtian had died in his hands back then, he did not mind killing ‘him’ a second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… it’s just as well. My cultivation journey began with Lin Langtian. Now that I have reached the pinnacle, I shall resolve all my grudges with you. This is despite the fact that the “Lin Langtian" standing in front of me is not the actual person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Langtian laughed as he slowly sized up Lin Dong. Finally, he sighed and said, “I never expected that someone else was actually able to reach the Ancestor stage. It seems like I have miscalculated. The Symbol Ancestor had also left a hidden move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This world does not belong to you. You should return to where you came from.” Lin Dong lowered his eyes before he said in an indifferent manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am able to sense your hatred towards me. It seems like you must have paid quite a hefty price in order to reach the Ancestor stage. Are you willing to let me go just like this?’ Lin Langtian laughed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am indeed a little unwilling…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong lifted his head and inhaled a deep breath of air. Then, he looked at the sky and there seemed to be the outline of a lovely young lady flashing at that spot. After which, it gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order for me to reach this stage, I had to lose her… Therefore, if I do not kill you bastard, that would be… truly upsetting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An icy cold ferocity slowly rose within Lin Dong’s eyes. Soon after, everyone felt that the entire world was beginning to buzz and tremble. Following which, countless dazzling rays of light surged from all directions, before they gathered behind Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, you should stay!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong clenched his hand before eight rays of light rushed over. After which, they circled around him. They were in fact the eight great Ancestral Symbols.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh swoosh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, many rays of light rushed over. They were the nine great divine objects, which included the Ancestor Stone, Great Desolate Tablet etc…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have finally succeeded…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A glow surfaced on the Ancestor Stone, before Yan looked at Lin Dong. When he realized that the pressure radiating from the latter was similar to that of the Symbol Ancestor, a pleased and satisfied expression rose within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could have imagined that this weak young man from Qingyang Town, would now stand at the apex of this world. In fact, since the beginning of time, only the Symbol Ancestor could hold a candle to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I shall change all of you temporarily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled towards Yan. However, his smile seemed a little tragic. After which, he clenched his hand, before the nine great divine objects began to connect with each other. Then, they seemingly transformed into an ancient seven coloured spear. Meanwhile, a terrifying force was flowing across the body of this spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Lin Dong had advanced to the highest level in this world. In fact, his strength was no longer inferior to that of the Symbol Ancestor. Therefore, although the nine great divine objects were all extremely powerful, they still merged and bent according to his will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was holding onto a seven coloured spear, while the eight Ancestral Symbols danced around him. A pressure, which could tower over the world, radiated from him. Immediately, this caused countless experts down in the Chaotic Demon Sea to tremble in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was genuine hope!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only with such absolute strength, could one finally stop the devil godlike Yimo Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill me? This was something that even the Symbol Ancestor failed to do. Therefore, what can you do even if you have reached his cultivation level?” Lin Langtian smiled faintly as he looked at the seven coloured light surging in all directions behind Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong did not reply. He pointed his hands at Lin Langtian, before he suddenly clenched them. Promptly, the hundred thousand feet empty space seemingly collapsed, before a frightening force, which could even shatter a Reincarnation stage expert who had passed three Reincarnation Tribulations, gushed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Langtian placed his hands together, before black ink like flames swept out from within his body and forcefully blocked the space shattering pressurizing force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, in that case, allow this emperor to experience how powerful the new ancestor really is?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Langtian laughed out loud. Following which, monstrous demonic aura surged behind him before it actually transformed into several million feet tall viscous demonic aura torrents. These torrents streaked across the sky in a grand and mighty fashion, before they meandered like large devil dragons and charged forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless individuals were shocked when they saw that wherever these demonic aura torrents swept past, the space would collapse instantly, before numerous black cracks quickly spread across the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The demonic aura torrents finally arrived. Lin Dong gently stomped his foot, before dazzling light swept out from all directions. This dazzling light contained an endless amount of Yuan Power and mighty Mental Energy. In fact, it contained the strength of the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the seven coloured light transformed into a huge light disc, that was millions of feet in size. That disc slowly rotated, allowing the demonic aura torrents to whiz over before they finally slammed ruthlessly against its surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The world trembled at this moment. In fact, the word ‘terrifying’ could hardly give justice to a fight like this. After all, just the frightening fluctuations given off by their attacks alone, would cause a Reincarnation stage expert’s face to turn pale. Moreover, they knew that with their current strength, they would perish the instant they came into contact with their attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a grave expression on their faces, the Life Death Master’s group stared at the both of them, who were fighting it out in the sky. The strength of the Yimo Emperor should be equivalent to an expert at the Ancestor stage. Therefore, both Lin Dong and the Yimo Emperor were at the same level and a fight between them was definitely going to be an earth shaking one.</span></p>

Finally, his massive body shrunk rapidly, while the viscous demonic aura around him disappeared at a frightening rate.</span></p>

However, Lin Dong could afford to wait. After all, from today onwards, there was no way the Yimo Emperor could ever make a comeback!</span></p>
