 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, the capital was undoubtedly much grander compared to before. However, the capital’s surroundings were pervaded with the flames of war, and it was no longer as prosperous or safe compared to its prior state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge light array, which resembled a flipped bowl, covered the entire capital. Meanwhile, the city walls were densely packed with soldiers armed with spears. Currently, their eyes were all filled with anxiety as they stared into the distance. At that area, there were countless individuals scattered across the mountain range, while battle cries sounded continuously. Meanwhile, there were numerous individuals standing in the sky above that area, and the powerful auras radiating from their bodies, created a pressure that exceeded that brought by the tens of thousands of soldiers below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless people clenched their teeth while they held tightly onto their weapons. Meanwhile, hatred and anger filled their eyes. The capital was the last line of defence for the Great Yan Empire. Hence, if it was broken, their Great Yan Empire would be history. At that time, they would become individuals with no country, and would be forced to leave their homes to roam aimlessly. Moreover, this miserable fate was something that they, citizens of the Great Yan Empire, had witnessed far too many times over the past year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the entire capital was covered by the fog of war and the atmosphere was extremely tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the atmosphere within a large hall in the capital was so tense that it had almost solidified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were many people in that large hall and a tall burly middle-aged man was seated in front. Upon closer inspection, one realized that he was the current ruler of the Great Yan Empire, Mo Jingtian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, his eyes looked even sterner compared to a couple of years ago, and there were more white hairs on his head. Meanwhile, there was great anxiety between his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A handsome green clothed young man stood beside Mo Jingtian and this young man looked fairly familiar. He was Mo Ling, the person who joined the Hundred Empire War together with Lin Dong, and subsequently accompanied him to join Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, Mo Ling’s strength had surged after three years of training. In fact, his aura was even more formidable than Mo Jingtian. It was likely that he had already advanced to the Profound Life stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than the royal family, there was another group of people seated right next to them. They were wearing robes of a similar colour, and many people in the hall had envious expressions when they looked at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were the Lin Clan from the Great Yan Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the current Lin Clan was completely different compared to before. In fact, their strength had far exceeded the other three Great Clans and even the royal family. Furthermore, even the royal family did not dare to express the slightest bit of displeasure towards the growing Lin Clan. Of course, there was only one simple reason behind this. It was because of that one person from the Lin Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A clansman called Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because of him, that the Dao Sect repeatedly bestowed gifts upon the Lin Clan. In fact, even the Great Yan Empire benefited as its strength had grown and it even managed to shake off its status as a low rank empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, everyone knew that even though the royal family was supposedly in charge of the Great Yan Empire, the words spoken by the Lin Clan were even more powerful than the royal family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Lin Fan, the enemy’s troops are currently pressing in on our border walls. What should we do?” Mo Jingtian looked towards the Lin Clan. At that spot, there were two figures seated side by side at the front. One of them was the head of the Lin Clan, Lin Fan, while the other was a white haired elderly man. Though the latter remained silent, no one dared to be disrespectful towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, there was a middle-aged man behind the latter. He had a stern looking face, and his looks bore some resemblance to that of Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That old man was Lin Zhentian, Lin Dong’s grandfather. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man seated behind him was Lin Xiao, Lin Dong’s father. At the same time, there was also a pretty woman beside him. She was Lin Dong’s mother, Liu Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thanks to their relationship with Lin Dong, their status within the Lin Clan was such that even the clan head Lin Fan, did not dare to offend them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Fan sighed softly upon hearing Mo Jingtian’s inquiry. Then, he shook his head bitterly. The Eastern Xuan Region was currently in chaos and even Dao Sect was barely able to protect themselves. Therefore, what could they possibly do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is rumoured that some experts from the Yuan Gate are coming over. Once they arrive, I’m afraid…” Mo Jingtian laughed bitterly and said, “I wonder if the elders from Dao Sect…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes shifted towards another spot as he spoke. There were over a dozen figures quietly seated there. One of them was a gray robed blind old man. This was also a familiar figure. In fact, he was the Dao Sect elder who was managing the Martial Arts Hall while Lin Dong was in Dao Sect. Back then, Lin Dong had received quite a lot of pointers from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this Dao Sect elder merely shook his head quietly at this moment. Meanwhile, he had a slightly gloomy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the hall could only sigh softly upon seeing this. After which, their expressions became somewhat pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, isn’t martial senior Lin Dong still alive? It is rumoured that he is completely different from before. If he returned, we might stand a chance.” Just as the crowd descended into silence, a delicate looking young lady behind the blind elder suddenly interrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young lady joined Dao Sect after Lin Dong left. However, even though she had never met him before, this did not stop her from becoming a loyal fan of martial senior Lin Dong. After all, it was precisely because of him that she chose to join the Desolate Hall, even though she was qualified to join the Sky Hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This name, which seemingly had a magical ring to it, resounded through the hall, lifting the spirits of many individuals present. After which, their eyes involuntarily turned towards Lin Zhentian, Lin Xiao and Liu Yan from the Lin Clan, whom had not spoken throughout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Zhentian, who remained silent for a long time, sighed softly at this moment. At the moment, there was a tinge of pride on his elderly face. However, there was also a deeper yearning on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How many years has it been since I last saw that little brat?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;That stubborn little fellow from Qingyang Town, had actually became the pride of their entire Lin Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, the stern expression on Lin Xiao’s face slowly became a gentle one. Meanwhile, Liu Yan’s eyes began to turn red. After which, she leaned on Lin Xiao before a soft sobbing sound appeared. Over all these years, after those two little fellows left their home, as their mother, she was undoubtedly stricken with grief and worry to the point whereby she was about to go crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A low and deep signal suddenly sounded from afar, while the entire hall was filled with sadness. Everyone’s expressions quickly changed as they suddenly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are about to attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countless individuals standing on the city walls braced themselves. Meanwhile, Mo Jingtian, Lin Zhentian and the others in the hall also hurried over to the city walls. Then, with a grave expression, they stared at the scene in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a black sea of troops that extended to the limits of one’s vision. Meanwhile, the army was pressing towards their borders with a formidable aura.</span></p>

The person in front seemed to be the general in command. He laughed out loud towards the sky as he said.&nbsp;</span></p>

Therefore, all of you should prepare to die today!”</span></p>

After which, hundreds of figures appeared in a flash. All of them had powerful auras and a black and white insignia in front of their chest. That insignia seemed to resemble Yin Yang, and it was the symbol of Yuan Gate.</span></p>

He had an indifferent expression as he looked at the crowd on the city walls. It appeared as though he was looking at mere ants.</span></p>

Meanwhile, a trace of fear flashed across the eyes of the Dao Sect disciples behind him. This was because Zhao Kui was an expert from Yuan Gate which had recently joined the rank of its elites. In fact, it was rumoured that he had reached the Samsara stage. However, he was wounded by senior sister Ying Huanhuan when he attacked Dao Sect back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, they did not expect Yuan Gate to actually dispatch an ultimate Samsara stage expert in order to deal with a mere Great Yan Empire.</span></p>

Then, as he was too lazy to say anything more to what he perceived as mere ants, he waved his sleeve. Immediately, the surrounding Yuan Power churned and it looked as though the sky itself had darkened.</span></p>

Then, he pressed his finger forward before vast and mighty Yuan Power gathered. After which, they transformed into a ten thousand feet large Yuan Power finger that looked just like a pillar supporting the sky. Then, that finger tore through the empty space before it heavily slammed onto that large light array, in front of many shocked pair of eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Then, a thought passed through his mind before powerful Mental Energy swept forward. However, he spat out a mouthful of blood the moment his Mental Energy made contact with that large finger. After which, his aura became feeble. After all, it was simply too much of a stretch for him to fight a Samsara stage expert, when he was only at the Profound Death stage.</span></p>

Therefore, with a final tremble, it finally exploded and turned into countless speckles of light that permeated the sky. The capital’s final line of defence was officially broken at this moment.</span></p>
