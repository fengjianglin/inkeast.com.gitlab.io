Meanwhile, there were intense deathly ripples being emitted from deep within its large mouth, causing one’s scalp to turn numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The land began trembling violently at this moment before a strong suction force was emitted from the mouth of that Cosmic Evil Devil King. The strength of that suction force was such that even the massive bodies of the transformed Lin Dong trio showed signs of being dragged away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the suction force suged, a black glowing halo suddenly shot out from within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s mouth. After which, it wrapped around the Darkness Saint Tiger, that Little Flame had transformed into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh.</span></p>

Immediately, Little Flame’s large body was lifted into the air before he was dragged towards the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s huge mouth, which now looked like a deep abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>

Meanwhile, black and white light continuously surged out from within his body in an attempt to resist that suction force. However, it was to no avail. Instead, all he could do was to stare at that large mouth, which was now growing closer and closer. Meanwhile, the depths of that large mouth looked just like the abyss of death, and a rich sense of danger rose from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten’s expression changed drastically when he saw that Little Flame was in danger. Immediately, he flapped his large bat wings and rushed forward in an attempt to rescue Little Flame.</span></p>

Immediately, mighty demonic aura surged before he directly pushed Little Marten back.</span></p>

Meanwhile, their laughter was filled with evil and cruelty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame struggled intensely. However, when he realized that there was no escape, a fearsome glint suddenly appeared in his tiger eyes. Then, fresh blood seeped out from his large body, before waves of wild and violent energy erupted forth. It seems like he was about to self-destruct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

Then, a huge purple-gold dragon tail swung violently against his body, before the powerful force directly sent him flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame was startled. After which, he hurriedly took a look before he was instantly stunned. This was because he saw that the huge purple-gold dragon that Lin Dong had transformed into, had taken his place instead. After which, that large mouth, which was releasing endless demonic aura, swallowed Lin Dong in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother!”</span></p>

After which, he turned around and charged towards the Cosmic Evil Devil King. However, he was quickly stopped by Little Marten, who appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second brother?! What are you doing?” Little Flame cried out furiously upon seeing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you panicking? Do you really think that he is so reckless? It isn’t going to be so easy to swallow him!” Little Marten’s handsome face sunk as he chided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” Little Flame hesitated for a moment before he collected himself. However, his tiger eyes were still completely red. Previously, he clearly detected the frightening demonic aura within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s large mouth. In fact, it was likely that even a Reincarnation stage expert would be eroded if he was to fall within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, the both of you can quit dreaming. Even a Reincarnation stage expert would be turned into ashes by the demonic aura after falling into the Cosmic Evil Devil Abyss. That arrogant Lin Dong actually believes that he can avoid this fate. What a joke!” The three great heads of Yuan Gate laughed out loud. Meanwhile, their laughter was filled with mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten stared at the three of them, who were laughing now, with no emotion on his face. Instead, he merely said faintly to Little Flame, “Once the opportunity arises, unleash your full strength and attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame relaxed slightly after he saw that Little Marten was not genuinely worried. After which, he nodded solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finishing off Lin Dong, who was the most troublesome one to deal with, the three great heads of Yuan Gate were clearly extremely excited. Then, they directed their dark and cold eyes towards the Little Marten duo. Promptly, a ferocious smile appeared before they prepared to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as they were about to attack, a strange buzzing sound was suddenly emitted from within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body. When they heard that sound, shock immediately surfaced in the eyes of the three great heads of Yuan Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You three old dogs, this young master is a tough nut to crack. I’m afraid that you will only get indigestion after you swallow me!” A chuckle sounded after the buzzing sound appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are indeed a tough nut to crack. However, I don’t believe that you can survive after falling into the Cosmic Evil Devil Abyss!” A cold glint flashed across the eyes of the three great heads. Following which, the colour of the Cosmic Evil Devil King darkened even further. Then, a frightening demonic aura wildly gushed forward in an attempt to kill Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I will purify as much demonic aura as you can throw at me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Dong’s loud laughter once again sounded after the demonic aura surged out. All of a sudden, the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s huge body trembled violently. That was because a warm white glow was actually seeping out from within its huge body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ahh!</span></p>

Following which, miserable screeches sounded, before the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s large body began to tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumble!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the white light flickered, a low and deep thunder roar followed. In fact, it seemed like an extremely violent thunderbolt had exploded within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body. Moreover, the thunderbolt force completely shattered the powerful demonic aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You bastard!”</span></p>

Promptly, a fearsome glint flashed across their eyes. Following which, thunder began to rumble within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body. Then, its large belly vibrated continuously as demonic aura charged towards Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attack, stop them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten quickly cried out sternly upon seeing this. After which, he took the lead and charged forward. Then, he clenched his fist before ten purple-black crescent moons appeared around him. After which, together with intense Reincarnation ripples, they whizzed ruthlessly towards the Cosmic Evil Devil King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame released a tiger roar. As he was already raring to go, he was even faster than Little Marten. Promptly, black and white light was released before his sharp tiger claws tore through the air and directly left deep and bloody scars on the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s black metal like body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cosmic Evil Devil King was outraged as it immediately swung its devil totem pole and hit Little Flame’s body. A low and deep sound followed and the latter incurred serious injuries. Though fresh blood continued to flow, Little Flame showed no signs of retreating. Instead, black and white light crazily gathered on his tiger claws. After which, he ruthlessly swiped at the Cosmic Evil Devil King. It seemed like he wanted to rip the latter into pieces.</span></p>

After which, fresh black blood rolled down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they were being disrupted by the Little Marten duo, the three great heads were unable to concentrate on dealing with Lin Dong. Instead, they had to turn their attention towards the Little Marten duo as well. Nonetheless, because they lost Lin Dong in the process, the Little Marten duo were immediately pushed into a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the both of them revealed their fearsome nature, as they continued to attack and hurt the Cosmic Evil Devil King even at the risk of incurring serious injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the Little Marten duo were pestering the Cosmic Evil Devil King, the latter’s strength was gradually diminishing. This was because the demonic aura within its body was being rapidly purified by Lin Dong. As such, it was clearly a foolish decision for the three great heads of Yuan Gate to swallow Lin Dong. After all, the latter was full of divine objects which specialised in dealing with the Yimo. Therefore, by using these items, the demonic aura within the Cosmic Evil Devil King would be of little use against Lin Dong, regardless of how dense they were.</span></p>

Their attacks ruthlessly landed on the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body. Following which, frightening strength came pouring down and they left a deep and bloody hole on the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Roar!”</span></p>

After which, it howled towards the sky before it spat out a black light. Finally, that black light gradually turned into a human figure, who stood in midair. He was Lin Dong, who was previously swallowed.</span></p>

In fact, there was even a trace of blood on the corner of his lips. Although he had turned the insides of the Cosmic Evil Devil King &nbsp;upside down, he had clearly suffered significant injuries as well.</span></p>

That was because they realized that the internal injuries suffered by the Cosmic Evil Devil King were far more severe than those external ones caused by the all-out attacks from the Lin Dong trio previously. Crucially, the demonic aura within the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body had became extremely chaotic after being messed up by Lin Dong. This had undoubtedly weakened it.</span></p>

After which, he slowly wiped off the blood on the corner of his lips before he sat down in midair.</span></p>

Then, he withdrew the mighty Yuan Power undulated over his body. As of now, he looked eerily calm.</span></p>

Immediately, they felt uneasy in their hearts. After the big mess caused by Lin Dong previously, they no longer dared to underestimate this young man, who was forced by them to flee the Eastern Xuan Region like a homeless stray three years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fearsome glint flashed across their eyes before the Cosmic Evil Devil King roared. Then, the devil totem pole in its hand transformed into a black ray of light, before it penetrated through space and flew straight towards Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>

Then, Little Marten’s ten thousand feet large purple-black wings guarded Lin Dong like a wing shield, before he forcefully clashed against the totem pole.</span></p>

Immediately, Little Marten felt a sweet sensation rush up his throat, before he vomited a mouthful of blood. However, he forcefully stabilized his body before he blocked the ferocious attack from the Cosmic Evil Devil King .</span></p>

Following which, monstrous black and white light surged out from within his huge body. Soon after, his already large body swelled once again. Meanwhile, endless scarlet colour surged within his tiger eyes. Finally, his incomparably sharp tiger claws tore through space and wildly attacked the Cosmic Evil Devil King .</span></p>

Then, it waved its arms. An earthshaking low and deep noise would sound every time a punch landed on Little Flame’s body. As the space vibrated, Little Flame’s black and white body was gradually dyed blood red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten also had crimson eyes.

Then, his crescent blades formed a shocking arc before he ruthlessly hacked the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s body.</span></p>

Extending its devil arms, they penetrated through space before it used one arm to grab Little Marten’s bat wing, while the other grabbed Little Flame’s tiger hand. After which, it slammed the two of them together violently. Immediately, blood spluttered before the two of them flew backwards, leaving a hundred thousand feet large crack on the ground.</span></p>

Following which, a black line of light appeared between his brows before it slowly split apart. Finally...a mysterious eye, with some lightning arcs crackling within its deep and dark pupil, appeared between Lin Dong’s brows.</span></p>
