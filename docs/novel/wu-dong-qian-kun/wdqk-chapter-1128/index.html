 <p>Buzz!</p>
 <p>Four light pillars floated around Luo Tong’s body, before powerful pressurizing waves radiated from them. The Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars were all in Luo Tong’s hands at this moment.</p>
 <p>Previously, Teng Feng’s group had merely relied on one Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars each in order to defeat the Golden Ape Demon Commander duo. Yet, all four pillars were reunited at this moment. Hence, the true might of the Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars would be completely unleashed.</p>
 <p>“This brat, he is actually able to force Luo Tong to use every Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillar…” Teng Feng’s group had somewhat grave expressions when they saw this scene. Soon after, they chuckled. Since this fight has played out like this, there would no longer be any suspense in the subsequent fight.</p>
 <p>The expressions of the distant Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s group also became quite ugly at this moment. To begin with, Luo Tong’s strength had far surpassed Lin Dong’s. Hence, they had never expected that Luo Tong actually had to use every Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillar in order to deal with the latter.</p>
 <p>“Relax, big brother will not be defeated so easily.” Compared to the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s group, Little Flame was much calmer. Even though he was well aware of just how powerful Lin Dong’s opponent was, Little Flame had complete blind faith in him.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio exchanged glances with each other, before the anxiety in their hearts diminished slightly. From the way Lin Dong and Luo Tong fought previously, it was clear that the former’s strength had surged over these past two months. Hence, based on the fact that Lin Dong actually dared to fight head on with the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander two months’ ago, it was likely that the current him was even stronger.</p>
 <p>Under the attention from countless onlookers, Luo Tong’s expression was as calm as still water. However, there was a venomous glint flashing in his eyes. He stared at Lin Dong before he suddenly clenched his hand.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The four light pillars quickly gathered together after Luo Tong clenched his hand. After which, they directly turned into a huge stone pillar with four different colors. Four light images entwined around the pillars while an exceptionally powerful ripple was emitted.</p>
 <p>That ripple was clearly much more powerful than the ones given off by any one of the Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars from before.</p>
 <p>“Let’s end it.”</p>
 <p>Luo Tong’s eyes were like blades as he stared at Lin Dong. Soon after, a sinister voice spread. Without further ado, he waved his sleeves before the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” turned into a four colored light ray that whistled forward. Everywhere that it passed by, a storm would be stirred. Following which, a formless pressure spread and it actually enveloped the space around Lin Dong. The space became distorted and it blocked off all of Lin Dong’s retreat paths, just like a prison cell.</p>
 <p>The combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” showcased their frightening might the moment it appeared.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes, which were filled with a purple-gold luster, stared intently at the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars”. However, Lin Dong’s face did not even contain the slightest panic when up against Luo Tong’s attack, which could defeat even an ordinary Samsara stage expert. Instead, he had a slightly mysterious expression.</p>
 <p>“Ancient divine object, huh…”</p>
 <p>The corner of Lin Dong’s lips seemed to have twitched, before a strange smile appeared as he muttered, “This divine object is powerful indeed. However, it is not very effective against me.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong extended his hand after he spoke. After which, light gathered in his palm before a miniature hall appeared. After the miniature hall appeared, a strange ripple began to spread.</p>
 <p>This miniature hall was clearly the Mysterious Divine Palace, which was ranked tenth on the Ancient Divine Object Ranking!</p>
 <p>“Buzz!”</p>
 <p>The Mysterious Divine Palace emitted a buzzing sound the moment it appeared. After which, everyone saw that hall rapidly expanding. In the blink of an eye, it became ten thousand feet in size. Soon after, a creaking sound appeared as its doors slowly opened up.</p>
 <p>The combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars”, which was rushing over, emitted a chaotic ripple when the doors of that hall opened up. When Luo Tong saw this unusual change, his expression changed immediately while uneasiness rose in his heart.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Mysterious Divine Palace was finally fully opened. Immediately, tens of thousands of light rays shot out from within. Those overbearing light rays shot out of the large hall and transformed into countless chains. The chains rushed forward and entwined around the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” that was charging towards it.</p>
 <p>Buzz!</p>
 <p>Many light chains entwined around the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars”. The extremely wild and violent energy, which was originally on the latter’s body, began to disappear in a peculiar fashion. In fact, it looked as though all the energy on it was being suppressed by the many strange light chains.</p>
 <p>Moreover, while the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” was being suppressed, a powerful suction force gushed out from within the large hall. After which, the combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” swayed as it moved closer towards the large hall.</p>
 <p>This scene caused many onlookers to be stunned. Originally, they thought that the fight would swiftly end after Luo Tong unleashed his “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars”. Yet, who could have imagined such a bizarre turn of events?</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>Luo Tong’s expression changed drastically. He could feel that as his combined “Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars” moved closer to the Mysterious Divine Palace, his control over it gradually weakened.</p>
 <p>“Using an ancient divine object ranked beneath the Mysterious Divine Palace in front of the latter, is not a wise move.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong smiled towards an angry looking Luo Tong. He changed his hand seal before the light chains entwined around the combined Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars, actually began to wiggle. After which, they transformed into many mysterious symbols. However, the instant these symbols were formed, Luo Tong’s control over the Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars was severed immediately.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>The Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars no longer struggled after Luo Tong lost control of them. Instead, while being wrapped by tens of thousands of light rays, it directly charged into the Mysterious Divine Palace in front of many stunned onlookers.</p>
 <p>Bam.</p>
 <p>The doors of the Mysterious Divine Palace was subsequently shut. The Mysterious Divine Palace once again turned into the size of a palm and landed in Lin Dong’s palm. However, the Mysterious Divine Palace was currently shaking. Clearly, it was trying its best to suppress the Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars that it had just captured.</p>
 <p>“Haha, thank you for the gift.” Lin Dong flipped his palm before the Mysterious Divine Palace in his hand vanished. After which, he looked at Luo Tong, who appeared to be at a loss, and smilingly said.</p>
 <p>The entire plains became a little quieter at this moment. Standing behind him, Teng Feng and the rest were stunned. After all, this ending was simply a little too comical.</p>
 <p>The Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars was simply taken away by Lin Dong?</p>
 <p>“The Mysterious Divine Palace possess the ability to refine divine objects. Moreover, it also possess a suppressive force against the many divine objects that are ranked beneath it. It is unexpected that Lin Dong is able to control the Mysterious Divine Palace to such a shocking extent…” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s group were also stunned. That was because they had some understanding of the Mysterious Divine Palace, and they knew that one had to have a shocking level of mastery over the Mysterious Divine Palace, in order to use it to suppress and subjugate other powerful ancient divine objects. However, it has only been two months since Lin Dong obtained the Mysterious Divine Palace.</p>
 <p>Of course, these people, who did not understand Lin Dong, did not know that the latter had came into contact with the spirit of the “Mysterious Divine Palace” and did not need to expend any effort in order to control it. An example was the subjugation that occurred previously. It was completely the will of the Mysterious Divine Palace itself and Lin Dong merely helped to direct it.</p>
 <p>However, the Four Divine Beast Immortal Suppression Pillars was also quite powerful. Although it was taken away by the Mysterious Divine Palace, the latter still had to put in some effort in order to suppress it. Hence, Lin Dong was no longer able to use the Mysterious Divine Palace for now.</p>
 <p>In the sky, the dazed Luo Tong finally regained his senses. His face quickly turned furious and steely-cold. Meanwhile, his body was trembling gently. Clearly, he felt extremely furious in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Another unorthodox method… You truly have many of those.”</p>
 <p>Luo Tong’s eyes were incomparably dark and cold as he stared at Lin Dong. Murderous intent surged within his heart like floodwater. After all, Lin Dong’s actions have caused him to completely throw his face!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Brutal killing desire swept out from within Luo Tong’s body in waves. Soon after, nine colored light rays shot out from within his body in all directions. Light gathered in the sky behind him and seemed to turn into a huge figure. Behind this light figure, were nine different colored ten thousand feet tails. As they swayed gently with the wind, the Yuan Power in the world also began to churn violently.</p>
 <p>“What a hateful person. Do you really think that it is going to be so easy to snatch something that belongs to me?” Luo Tong’s eyes were icy cold. Soon after, he slowly extended two fingers and pointed towards Lin Dong. Finally, he pressed his fingers downwards.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s pupils shrunk upon witnessing this scene. An indescribable feeling of danger enveloped his entire body.</p>
 <p>“Nine Phoenix Life Transformation Light.”</p>
 <p>Luo Tong’s icy cold voice was filled with killing intent as it resounded across the sky. Soon after, nine colored light swiftly gathered at the tip of his fingers. In the next moment, those nine color light rays directly penetrated through the empty space and flew towards Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>The pores all over Lin Dong’s body shrunk at this moment, while his body pulled back explosively. Meanwhile, three hundred purple-gold dragon light tattoos flew forward and ruthless smashed against those nine colored light rays.</p>
 <p>Creak creak!</p>
 <p>The two ferocious attacks clashed. However, what startled Lin Dong, was that his attack, which had agglomerated the strength of three hundred purple-gold dragon light tattoos, was completely vaporized by the nine colored light rays.</p>
 <p>It was just like snow meeting lava!</p>
 <p>The nine colored light rays were actually this terrifying.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong unleashed his speed to the limit. As he continued to retreat, that nine colored light rays continued to chase after him. Meanwhile, the Yuan Power in this entire area became wild and violent.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong rapidly took a turn. The nine colored light rays followed him and took a turn as well. When they turned, one nine color light ray accidentally made contact with one of the onlookers. Immediately, that onlooker, who was at the advance Profound Death stage, was instantly vaporized without even having the time to let out a miserable screech. Immediately, shock rose in the eyes of countless onlookers upon seeing this scene.</p>
 <p>“Wherever the Nine Phoenix Life Transformation Light of my Nine Phoenix tribe passes by, all flesh and blood shall be vaporized!” Luo Tong looked at Lin Dong, who was repeatedly dodging, before joy flashed across his face as he laughed ferociously.</p>
 <p>“I want to see where a mouse like you plans to hide!”</p>
 <p>Purple-gold light wrapped around Lin Dong’s body. Meanwhile, his expression had also became extremely grave. Luo Tong’s technique caused him to feel a rich sense of danger. A Samsara stage expert was indeed a being that a Profound Death stage expert could not contend with. Even though Lin Dong possessed many powerful techniques, he still had great difficulties dealing with him.</p>
 <p>“I want to see whether your Nine Phoenix Life Transformation Light is able to vaporize my Primal Dragon Bone!”</p>
 <p>When Lin Dong saw that he was still unable to shake off those nine colored light rays after running for awhile, a ruthless expression finally rose within his eyes. His body suddenly paused. Then, without any hesitation, he turned his body around and threw a punch forward. After which, he ruthlessly smashed against the nine colored light rays amidst Luo Tong’s ferocious laughter.</p>
 <p>Chi!</p>
 <p>While the faces of the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s group turned pale, the nine colored light rays engulfed Lin Dong instantly.</p>
