Subsequently, they raised their heads and stared at the gigantic formation in the sky. At this moment, a lifelike ice sculpture was seated quietly in the middle of the formation. In fact, it seemed as though her surroundings were completely frozen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew whether there were any signs of life remaining within the ice statue.</span></p>

This was because over the last year, despair had gripped the entire world, and this ice statue was the final pillar of support keeping peace in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, they simply could not imagine what a devastating sight it would be, if there were truly no signs of life within that ice statue.&nbsp;</span></p>

After all, regardless of whether she succeeded or failed, the end result would appear eventually. This was because the threat to this world was gradually approaching them.&nbsp;</span></p>

Furthermore, as of now, this was the first time that their eyes were not locked on the lifelike ice statue. Instead, their eyes were filled with rich fear as they stared beyond the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The originally azure sky had became a lot darker.

In fact, it was a place where even peak Reincarnation stage experts could not reach. However, as of now, they were all able to clearly see the crack between the planes. Evidently, this was because the seal between the planes was weakening and the demonic aura was gradually seeping through. Finally, that destroyer would descend into their world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dim sky was just like the source of despair. Immediately, a despairing expression climbed onto the faces of countless individuals. Could it be that there was no way they could avoid this calamity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some onlookers turned to look at the middle of the formation. At that spot, the ice statue continued to remain unbudging. It has already been one year… and they had depleted the strength of countless experts. However, the miracle that they were hoping for had yet to materialize. Perhaps, she has already failed?</span></p>

Immediately, countless individuals followed the din and lifted their heads. Subsequently, a shocked expression surged onto their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because they saw that a stream of diabolical demonic aura had gushed in from the crack, that was located beyond the universe. After which, that stream of demonic aura actually penetrated the dim seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These demonic aura was extremely frightening. In fact, even the hot sun in the sky lost its luster the moment it appeared. Soon after, a crack appeared on the seal between the planes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this crack appeared, numerous individuals felt like their heads had exploded. This was because they saw that there was an enormous eye behind that crack looking at them coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That enormous diabolical eye rotated slightly. Immediately, everyone felt a cold chill sweep past their bodies. In fact, due to that cold chill, the Yuan Power within their bodies seemingly froze for a moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless individuals were trembling in fear, while their faces were completely pale. This was because other than the Yimo Emperor, who was once sealed by the Symbol Ancestor, who else could possess such terrifying strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze was so cold and merciless, that it looked just like a devil surveying an army of ants. In a short period of time, his gaze swept across the entire world before it finally paused on the huge formation in the sky above the Chaotic Demon Sea. Accurately speaking, his gaze was locked on the ice statue in the middle of the formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw that lifelike statue, dense ripples finally surged within that large evil eye. Clearly, it detected a familiar fluctuation from that ice statue.</span></p>

When the crowd realized that large evil eye had locked its sight on the ice statue, their scalps turned numb immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>

After which, dense demonic aura forcefully gushed out from the seal between the planes, before it transformed into a pale looking hand.</span></p>

The Ice Master’s attempt to break into the Ancestor stage was the final pillar of hope for the entire world. Therefore, if she was interrupted at this moment, they would lose all hope.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop him!”</span></p>

Though they felt fearful in their hearts, at a desperate moment like this, they went crazy instead. Promptly, countless rushing wind sounds appeared before many glowing figures rushed forward like a swarm of locust. Following which, countless resplendent Yuan Power pillars streaked across the sky, before they smashed ruthlessly against the pale large hand penetrating through the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang bang!</span></p>

However, they could not even shake that large hand. Instead, the Yimo Emperor hand completely ignored these ant like attacks and headed straight for the large formation.</span></p>
