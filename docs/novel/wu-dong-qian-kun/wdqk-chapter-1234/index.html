This caused countless people to be stunned, especially the experts from Darkness Judgement Hall. Ever since Qingtan entered Darkness Judgement Hall, all they had seen was a cold and almost emotionless young lady. No one knew how much blood were on her fair little hands. In a short three years, she had advanced from an ordinary disciple to the most authoritative position, head judge, and even the other two deputy heads treated her with great respect despite her youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after getting used to seeing Qingtan’s bloody tactics, for the very first time today, they found that she also possessed such a weak side to her. She had completely lost her usual methods and charisma. Instead, she had truly become a girl who matched her age…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bewilderment filled the eyes of the elders from the Elder Council as they watched this scene. The two grand elders in the sky stared at the skinny figure with a dark and gloomy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of Qingtan crying went on and on. It was as though she wanted to cry out all the hardships and grievances she had suppressed over the last three years. Subsequently, Lin Dong looked at his wet chest as a wave of helplessness washed over him. He rubbed the little girl’s head and said, “Hey, have you still not cried enough? You do know that you are the current palace master of Darkness Palace right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl in his embrace sobbed softly. Only then did she lift her large red eyes. She looked at the matured yet familiar face, rubbed her sharp nose and said, “Big brother Lin Dong… I knew that nothing would happen to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am definitely fine, but I’m afraid that the same cannot be said for yourself.” Lin Dong glared at her a little. His eyes contained a slight bit of ill intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As someone who had grown up with him, Qingtan naturally knew his character like the back of her hand. She instantly understood the situation after seeing Lin Dong’s appearance. Her eyes rotated as a resentful expression emerged on her small face. She hugged Lin Dong and refused to release him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is not going to work. I will deal with you once I resolve the trouble here.” Lin Dong snorted coldly and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qingtan seemed to recover upon hearing this and cold light flashed across her eyes. She clenched her hand and the Darkness Saint Scythe flew into her hands. Soon after, she released Lin Dong. With icy eyes, she looked at the two grand elders in the distant sky as she said, “Big brother Lin Dong, allow me to finish them off this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ungh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words had only just sounded when Lin Dong’s hand violently pinched her face as he snapped, “Stand aside. You can forget about fighting when I am around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under such indignity from Lin Dong, Qingtan’s small face immediately frowned. This also caused the eyelids of the experts from Darkness Judgement Hall to twitch a little. It was likely that the impact of this scene was slightly too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are very formidable.” Qingtan said. These two grand elders were even more frightening than the three great heads of Yuan Gate...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your brother is even more formidable.” Lin Dong grinned and gently patted Qingtan’s head. However, his expression gradually became cold. The overbearing actions of these two elders towards Qingtan earlier had been clearly witnessed by him. Murderous intent involuntarily surged within his heart when he thought of how this little girl had been treated by them. Other than his parents, even he could not bring himself to scold or bully her. Just who did these two wretched old fogeys think they were?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sweet feeling swelled in Qingtan’s heart when she saw Lin Dong’s expression. After which, she nodded obediently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I know who this skillful friend is? Why are you intervening in the matters of our Darkness Palace?” The two grand elders frowned after seeing the intimate actions between Lin Dong and Qingtan and demanded in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong slowly turned around. His expression was indifferent as he looked at the two grand elders in the sky. “Did you have a good time bullying others earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friend, this is an internal matter of our Darkness Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qingtan is my younger sister.” An intimidating blade like smile surfaced on Lin Dong’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the two grand elders turn rigid for a moment, before growing increasingly gloomy. It was unexpected that this seemingly lone little girl actually had such a powerful big brother &nbsp;to support her. Why had no one mentioned this before?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The countless Northern Xuan Region experts in Darkness Square looked to each other. So the new palace master actually had such a powerful big brother. From the looks of what the two grand elders had treated Qingtan, it was likely that this big brother of hers would not simply let the matter rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if you are her big brother, she must be held accountable to the tens of thousands of people in Darkness Palace with regards to this matter.” The two grand elders coldly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Accountable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong seemed to laugh. Murder seemed to pour out of his eyes like a flood. “There should no longer be a need to account once I kill you two old farts, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong clearly comprehended the current situation of Darkness Palace. These two old things had merely used their seniority to bully others, causing the many members of Darkness Palace to be afraid of speaking out. Once these two were dealt with, everything would be naturally resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humph, arrogant brat. Why don’t you come and try and see if you can really finish the both of us off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Icy light flickered in the eyes of the two grand elders when they heard this. Although they could sense that it would be troublesome to deal with Lin Dong, they did not fear him. Their Reincarnation stage strength allowed them to look down on all experts. They did not believe that this little brat, who appeared to be only a little older than Qingtan, could really match them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s mouth parted into a grin. However, ferocity emanated from this grin of his. His body moved and directly appeared in the sky. He clenched his hands and thunder clouds suddenly converged the sky. Meanwhile, frightening thunderbolts crazily gathered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yuan Power of the entire place began to fluctuate wildly at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing this, the auras of the two grand elders surged as mighty Yuan Power unfurled. A dense Reincarnation ripple spread, causing one to feel a sense of dread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Darkness Palm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hand seals formed by the both of them changed, followed by an explosive shout. The two attacked together. Boundless Yuan Power turned into two incomparably black giant palms that shattered the void and ruthlessly swatted at Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning flashed within Lin Dong’s pupils as he leaped forward. Countless thunderbolts madly descended. They were accompanied by heaven’s might as they smashed heavily onto the two giant darkness palm. As lightning flashed, the wild and violent thunderbolt energy directly shattered the two giant darkness palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s body turned into a flash of lightning as it shot forward. A fist was thrown and thunder rumbled. A ten thousand feet large lightning dragon suddenly roared and shot forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Darkness Shield!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two grand elders sternly cried out. Yuan Power frantically condensed in front of them and turned into an enormous ten thousand feet large darkness shield. Reincarnation ripples flowed over its surface.</span></p>

Under the dazzling glow of lightning, waves of extremely violent energy wildly eroded the shield. In a split second, the darkness shield was covered in cracks. With a final ‘bang’, the shield was completely blasted apart.</span></p>

This was because they saw a figure appeared in front of them in a ghost like fashion. Purplish gold light dashed into the sky as thousands of purplish gold dragon tattoos let out a prolonged roar that resounded over the sky.</span></p>

After which, the two grand elders cried out loudly. Both of their hands were swung and an extremely dense Reincarnation ripple gathered in their palms. This caused their a white gem like luster to appear on their hands.</span></p>

Everyone was overwhelmed with shock as they watched the two grand elders being forced back a ten thousand feet.</span></p>

Terror surged within the gazes which were looking towards Lin Dong. Who could have imagined that the latter would actually be able to gain such an obvious advantage in this two versus one situation. Just how frightening was this fellow?</span></p>

The strength of these two were merely at the ordinary Reincarnation stage. In terms of strength, they were inferior to the three great heads of Yuan Gate that had merged into the Cosmic Evil Devil King. Given his current strength, taking care of them was not too troublesome.</span></p>

They hurriedly unleashed their full strength and frantically blocked the invading tearing force. After which, their faces flushed red. With a loud cry, they finally broke out from the black hole prison.</span></p>

Dazzling light seemed to fill the entire area as a ten thousand feet large thunderbolt light pillar descended like the light of judgement. In the end, it ruthlessly slammed onto the two figures with lightning speed.</span></p>
