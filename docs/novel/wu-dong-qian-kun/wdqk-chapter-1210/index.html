After which, intense shock surged within his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Contrary to expectations, Zhou Tong did not possess a body made up of flesh under his black robe. Instead, there wasn’t any blood or flesh at all, and there was only a black skeleton. Moreover, Lin Dong could see many densely packed mysterious black lines on the skeleton and those devil lines were entwined around Zhou Tong’s bones. They were just like maggots in one’s bones and they could not be removed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Lin Dong was able to see his organs, which were beating within his black skeleton. However, these organs were all completely black in colour. Clearly, they were completely eroded by the demonic aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what shocked Lin Dong the most was Zhou Tong’s heart. It was a pitch black heart, which was beating at an extremely slow pace. Moreover, that black heart was filled with endless evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could have imagined such a frightening scene below a complete human head.</span></p>

It was the strength of the Spatial Ancestral Symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those meridians were the only things within Zhou Tong’s body, which had yet to be eroded by the demonic aura. It was also the reason why he was still able to use the Spatial Ancestral Symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black devil lines entwined around Zhou Tong’s body and they vaguely formed an extremely evil devil lock. It was precisely this devil lock that reduced Zhou Tong to his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this… Devil Emperor Lock?” Yan’s exclamation suddenly sounded within Lin Dong’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Devil Emperor Lock? What is that?” Lin Dong frowned and hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“During the ancient times, this was a vicious technique created by the Yimo Emperor, the only one who could match up to my owner. As long as this thing was placed on a person’s body, he would gradually lose his mind and even his Yuan Spirit would be sealed within his body with no means of escape. In fact, even a Reincarnation stage expert would not be able to escape. Back then, those Yimo were afraid that certain Reincarnation stage experts would enter Reincarnation. Therefore, they placed the Devil Emperor Lock on those Reincarnation stage experts that they captured and destroyed them once in for all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A technique created by the Yimo Emperor? It’s even able to end the life of a Reincarnation stage expert?” Lin Dong’s pupils shrunk while shock filled his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This technique is extremely cruel. First, they would slice off the person’s flesh, before they would erode all his organs with demonic aura for ten years. After which, they would use the devil body as a lock and end all chances of life.” Yan said in a solemn voice. “Although this Devil Emperor Lock is not as complete as the ones seen during the ancient times, it is definitely not something that an ordinary Yimo king can create. It seems like Yuan Gate must be in cahoots with Devil Prison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those bastards!” Fury surged within Lin Dong’s eyes when he heard this. It’s no wonder Zhou Tong used his final consciousness to beg Lin Dong for death. It was likely because he was unable to endure the torture anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yan, is there still a way to rescue martial senior Zhou Tong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyone who has had the Devil Emperor Lock placed on him will definitely die. In fact, they can’t even enter Reincarnation. However…” Yan paused for a moment before continuing, “Zhou Tong is a little different since he possess the Spatial Ancestral Symbol. Therefore, his Yuan Spirit should be under its protection, and it should not have been completely eroded by the demonic aura.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can destroy this devil body, it might be possible to rescue his Yuan Spirit…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A glint flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swoosh!”</span></p>

Following which, many exclamations sounded from behind Lin Dong. A silver light had began to flicker on one black glove covering that emotionless Zhou Tong’s hands. Following which, the space behind Lin Dong became distorted, before an extremely sharp wind pierced towards his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

After which, a palm clashed with that silver light while lightning arcs danced and blocked the Spatial Strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swoosh!”</span></p>

Then, Yuan Power surged before a wild and violent palm wind, which was accompanied by dragon roars, ruthlessly smashed onto Zhou Tong’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang clang clang!</span></p>

It turns out that such attacks were unable to deal much damage to his black skeleton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom boom!</span></p>

Then, silver light surged before an incomparably sharp palm wind whistled forward. Finally, he clashed head on with Lin Dong. Following which, many wild and violent palm winds were formed before the space around the both of them were shaken until it cracked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Violent Yuan Power surged as the both of them quickly retreated. However, it was obvious that Lin Dong had the upper hand in this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, the strength of two Ancestral Symbols definitely exceeds that of the Spatial Ancestral Symbol in Zhou Tong’s possession.</span></p>

Promptly, a black glint flashed across his eyes before Zhou Tong’s body trembled. Soon after, Zhou Tong suddenly pressed his hand downwards before a mysterious ripple swiftly spread across the land. After which, everyone realized that the land beneath him was turning barren at a rapid pace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great Desolation Scripture?!”</span></p>

Then, the expression in their eyes became complicated. After all, they didn’t expect that even though Zhou Tong was being controlled, he was still able to unleash the strongest martial arts of their Dao Sect’s Desolate Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With this being the case, martial senior Zhou Tong, let us compete and see whose Great Desolation Scripture is stronger!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s eyes were glimmering. Then, he suddenly formed a seal with both of his hands. After which, he pressed his hand towards the ground before a low cry was emitted from his mouth, “Great Desolation Scripture!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rate at which the land was turning barren rapidly surged. Everyone could see that the desolate aura was spreading rapidly across the land. Within a couple of breaths, the land within thousands of kilometres was reduced into a wasteland. This overbearing martial arts caused many onlookers to feel a little fearful.</span></p>

Though everything looked calm on the surface, everyone could feel an extremely violent ripple flowing through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This violent ripple was the most prominent beneath the ground. Everyone could sense the land shaking after all the energy in the ground within thousands of kilometres, had gathered to this spot. After which, the energy was being bitterly contested by the two of them.</span></p>

Those grass were filled with strong vitality, and they looked extremely glaring amidst the desolate land.</span></p>

Right now, their emotions were extremely complicated. This was because they were aware that this was a match between the two most outstanding disciples of Dao Sect in the last hundred years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the hearts of the Dao Sect disciples, one was a former legend while the other was a newborn legend. However, out of these two legends, one of them must emerge victorious today.&nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, one could vaguely spot some light seeping out from beneath the ground. It turns out that extremely violent energy below was about to erupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huff.”</span></p>

Then, a smile surfaced on his face before he said, “Martial senior Zhou Tong, perhaps I shall emerge victorious in this fight.”</span></p>

Meanwhile, there was also black light surging from under his palms. Finally, they transformed into two huge black holes as well. After which, Devouring Power spluttered from them.</span></p>

After which, a tens of thousands of feet large energy light pillar erupted just like a volcano eruption, before it shot towards the sky. In fact, even the clouds were forcefully shattered.</span></p>

However, his energy light pillar was only half as thick as Lin Dong’s.</span></p>

After all, Lin Dong’s Great Desolation Scripture together with his Devouring Ancestral Symbol’s overbearing suction force far outclassed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw the face off between the two of them, countless exclamations erupted. In fact, Ying Xiaoxiao and the rest clenched their hands tightly, while joy surged onto their faces.</span></p>

A whistle sounded before it penetrated the empty space and headed straight towards Zhou Tong.</span></p>

Then, wild and violent Devouring Power surged and tore the empty space apart, leaving Zhou Tong unable to use his Spatial Ancestral Symbol to dodge that attack.</span></p>

Then, he stomped his foot before the huge energy light pillar lingering around him also whizzed forward. It looked just like a pillar that could split the sky, as it collided violently with that incoming energy light pillar, which was at least twice its size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>

At that spot, the empty space continuously shattered.</span></p>

Then, they saw a light figure suddenly rushing out from within the light pillar. Following which, a low roar sounded before a massive black hole began to grow from beneath his palms. Twirling both of his hands, he forcefully merged the two light pillars together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong grabbed the nearly hundred thousand feet large energy light pillar.

By the time the silver glint in Zhou Tong’s eyes were forcefully eroded, the frightening energy light pillar had already smashed onto his body. Soon after, a relieved colour appeared on his originally emotionless face.</span></p>
