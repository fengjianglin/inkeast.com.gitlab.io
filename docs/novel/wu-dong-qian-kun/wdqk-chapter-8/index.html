 <p>WDQK Chapter 8: Clash</p>
 <p>There was a relatively vast forest in the mountains at the back of the Lin Family district. If one were lucky, one could occasionally be able to find one an elixir or two in that forest. Thus, whenever they had some time, the younger generation of the Lin Family would always come by to try their luck. As such, one could probably say that the forest was a rather popular place among the Lin Family.</p>
 <p>At this time, there was quite a crowd at the entrance of the forest. These people were all young teenagers, clearly the younger generation of the Lin Family.</p>
 <p>Past the human wall, a group of sturdy figures towered at the centre of the road, just happening to block off the pathway. Behind these figures was a young girl in a light colored attire.</p>
 <p>The girl’s features were like a painting and her skin was white as the freshly fallen snow. Though she was still young, her beauty was already causing many to be breathless and stunned at the sight. And at this moment, her eyes, which were normally full of life, were now angrily staring at the figures in front of her. Her tiny dirt covered hand tightly grabbed a fire-red plant which was emitting a faint fragrance.</p>
 <p>“Lin Shan, don’t be too overbearing!”</p>
 <p>Qing Tan glared at the one particular figure at the head of the crowd, traces of anger in her normally lively voice.</p>
 <p>“Heh heh, we had already discovered this Scarlet Sun Grass yesterday, it’s just that we waited till today to retrieve it. Yet you’ve taken what was ours, how can you still say I’m the overbearing one?” The figure at the front turned out to be a youngster who looked to be about 14 or 15 years of age. At this point, he was grinning with his arms crossed while gazing at the angry Qing Tan.</p>
 <p>“That’s nonsense!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Lin Shan trying to twist the facts, Qing Tan’s tiny face reddened in anger. She had spent a lot of effort to find this Scarlet Sun Grass, how could that scoundrel have found it first? And if he really did find it first like he said, how could he have possibly left it there? Could it be that he was deliberately waiting someone else to pick it?</p>
 <p>“I’m not speaking nonsense……”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan gazed at Qing Tan who looked adorable even when angry. Nevertheless he was all smiles as he said: “Qing Tan, give me the Scarlet Sun Grass and I will let you go.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t even think of it!”</p>
 <p>Qing Tan grinded her teeth. Over this period of time, she had seen how Lin Dong had so painstakingly trained, as if his life was on the line. She also understood that if Lin Dong does not perform well in the upcoming Clan competition, not only he, but his parents as well, will suffer a tremendous blow.</p>
 <p>Thus, during this period, she had always come here in hopes of finding even just one elixir such that she could help Lin Dong increase his training pace. And having finally found one stalk of Scarlet Sun Grass today after much difficulty, how could she possibly hand it over to that horrible scoundrel!</p>
 <p>“Since it’s like that, looks like you can only spend the night in this place.” Lin Shan chuckled, glancing towards Qing Tan before continuing: “Just now, that brat Lin Changqiang seemed to run away, he should have went to find Lin Dong right? Good, I’m still not satisfied from that last beating I gave him.”</p>
 <p>At these words, Qing Tan’s tiny face changed. She knew that Lin Dong and Lin Shan usually never saw eye to eye and they would be itching to fight every time they met. However, every time they fought, Lin Dong always ended up on the short end of the stick.</p>
 <p>“Give the Scarlet Sun Grass to me and I will not beat him, how does that sound?” Seeing Qing Tan’s tiny face change, Lin Shan laughed heartily, pleased at himself.</p>
 <p>“You scoundrel!”</p>
 <p>Qing Tan bit her lip, her eyes already somewhat red. At this look, many would feel somewhat sorry for her. Although Qing Tan was not a part of the Lin Family, but because she was already so beautiful and such a lively young girl, don’t even bother mentioning the Lin Family, she held the adoration of many many youngsters. even in the entire QingShan Town.</p>
 <p>Yet, though many in the crowd were sorry for her and felt unsatisfied at this turn of events, after some consideration, they decided not to step in or say anything. Lin Shan was a little tyrant among the younger generation of the Lin Family. Not only did he have a substantial amount of strength, but his father was also the one in charge of the Lin Family’s finances. Thus no one was willing to offend him, and even if they did go and report him to the older generation, Lin Shan would at most be locked up for only one or two days. Plus, after getting out, he would definitely retaliate against the one who reported him. Therefore, among the younger generation, there were very few incidences of anyone coming into conflict with him.</p>
 <p>“Won’t you hand it over? If you don’t hurry up, I’m afraid Lin Dong will arrive at any moment……” Lin Shan taunted while deliberately acting as if he were surveying the surroundings, as if he was looking forward to Lin Dong’s arrival.</p>
 <p>“Take it!”</p>
 <p>Tears of grievance welled up in Qing Tan’s eyes, yet she stubbornly endured. Tightly gripping the Scarlet Sun Grass in her hands one last time, she gritted her teeth before fiercely throwing it towards Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>“Heh heh, good girl.”</p>
 <p>In response, Lin Shan gleefully stepped forward to catch the Scarlet Sun Grass which had been flung his way. However, just as he was about to snatch the Scarlet Sun Grass out of the air, a figure suddenly broke through the crowd and heavily smashed into his body. The tremendous force straightaway caused him to roll two rounds on the ground before finally coming to a halt.</p>
 <p>This sudden turn of events caused everyone to be shocked. Their gazes hastily turned to look at who had come before turning to ones of sympathy.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan crawled up from the ground, not caring about the dirt all over his body, he stared at the figure who was now standing at the spot he had occupied before. A malicious intent suddenly rose up in his eyes as he sneered: “Lin Dong? Good, looks like you’ve grown some balls in the few days that we’ve not seen each other. I guess I might have let you off too lightly the last time and you’ve yet to learn your lesson.”</p>
 <p>“Lin Shan, I’ve already given you the Scarlet Sun Grass, what else do you want?” Qing Tan said in anger as her tiny face changed upon seeing Lin Shan’s malicious look. She quickly picked up the Scarlet Sun Grass that had fallen to the ground and threw it over to Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>“I will take the elixir and also beat him today!” Lin Shan caught the Scarlet Sun Grass, sneering.</p>
 <p>“You!” Qing Tan’s tiny face grew hot with anger at these words. Her small hands formed into fists, even in her wildest dreams she had never imagined that Lin Shan would be such a scoundrel.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong also could not help but sneer at Lin Shan’s rude and unreasonable conduct. Soon after, he pulled Qing Tan to one side and returned Lin Shan’s words: “I will take the elixir and beat you today!”</p>
 <p>“Haha!”</p>
 <p>At Lin Dong’s words, Lin Shan was clearly stunned though he quickly regained his wits and laughed out loud. With a mocking gaze, he looked at the former and said: “Looks like I might have hit your head a little too hard previously?”</p>
 <p>The rest of the crowd also looked towards Lin Dong, baffled. Though it was good to be strong-willed, if one oversteps his boundaries, one would be asking for punishment. The two had fought many times before, but every single time it always ended up in Lin Dong being beaten black and blue.</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong-ge, don’t fight with him, we don’t need that Scarlet Sun Grass.” Seeing that Lin Dong wanted to clash against Lin Shan yet again, Qing Tan quickly pulled him back, a trace of worry in her voice.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Lin Dong, a true man knows better than to fight when the odds are stacked against him. Go back and train for a while longer before you come back and teach this bastard a lesson.” Lin Changqiang who had followed closely behind Lin Dong promptly opened his mouth to advise the latter.</p>
 <p>“Want to leave? It’s not that easy!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan sneered, in the next instant his figure dashed forward. In a few steps, he appeared before Lin Dong, his five fingers quickly gripping into a fist which flew towards the latter’s chest as it faintly emitted the sound of rushing wind.</p>
 <p>“Pa!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong gazed at Lin Shan’s fully powered fist, the corners of his mouth turning upwards into a sneer. Yet he did not duck nor dodge, instead his palm reached out and smashed into Lin Shan’s fist, causing the crowd’s gazes to turn to that of astonishment.</p>
 <p>As fist met palm, a loud noise like that of rocks smashing together sounded out. However, what amazed the crowd was the fact that Lin Dong had actually managed to receive Lin Shan’s punch!</p>
 <p>“Tempered Body 4th Layer?!”</p>
 <p>After that exchange, Lin Shan could sense that something was not right, his opponent’s skin felt as though it was at least as hard as his!</p>
 <p>Such a tough skin clearly belonged to someone who had reached the Tempered Body 4th Layer!</p>
 <p>“How is this possible? This brat was only at the 2nd Layer half a month ago, how could he have suddenly rose to the 4th Layer?!” Lin Shan could not believe it, yet he clenched his jaw, even if you have reached the Tempered Body 4th Layer, don’t even think of fighting with me!</p>
 <p>“Falling Rock Fist!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan withdrew his fist and suddenly let out a shout. On his arm, blue veins started to pop out, quickly extending all over his arm. Soon after, multiple images of fists appeared, like rocks, they smashed ferociously towards Lin Dong’s head. That kind of power was akin to the rocks flying out from an explosion.</p>
 <p>“Lower Category Level 1 Martial Arts, Falling Rock Fist? To think that Lin Shan has also started learning Martial Arts, Lin Dong is really unlucky.” The crowd was in an uproar after seeing Lin Dong’s current situation.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s gaze fixed itself on the multiple incoming fist images. Although Lin Shan’s Falling Rock Fist was not weak, he wondered why it appeared so full of flaws and mistakes in his eyes. Without hesitation, Lin Dong straightaway executed Penetrating Fist.</p>
 <p>“Pa! Pa! Pa!”</p>
 <p>The sleeves of his clothes slapped against his arm, causing a crisp and loud sound to echo out. At the same time, Lin Dong’s fist collided against Lin Shan’s fist images.</p>
 <p>“Thump!”</p>
 <p>Just as their fists touched together, Lin Shan’s body shuddered as a huge force rapidly rushed forth from his fist. After which, to his shock and amazement, waves of pain transmitted from both his rock hard fists.</p>
 <p>“Penetrating Fist, three echoes? How is this possible?!”</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Lin Shan’s eyes were thick with shock. Naturally, he had heard of Penetrating Fist, it was very well known among the Level 1 Martial Arts. He had originally planned on learning this Fist Technique, yet he was still unable to produce an echo even after ten days of training. Thus he had no option but to give up. Who could imagine that Lin Dong who was previously never a match for him would actually be capable of such success?!”</p>
 <p>“It’s not three echoes, its four!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong icily smiled, his arm jerked as another crisp sound echoed out. Following which, an increasingly heavy punch struck against both of Lin Shan’s fists.</p>
 <p>“Thud!”</p>
 <p>Faced with a four echo Penetrating Fist, Lin Shan’s Falling Rock Fist stance fell apart. Step by step, he staggered backwards before finally falling, to the amazement of the crowd of onlookers.</p>
 <p>Yet, just as Lin Shan was about to fall, an arm suddenly reached out to grab his shoulder. With a gentle push, Lin Shan was stabilized.</p>
 <p>“Ge!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan quickly turned his head to gaze at the figure who had appeared at his back, suddenly extremely happy. The surrounding crowd’s expressions also changed as fear flashed across their eyes.</p>
