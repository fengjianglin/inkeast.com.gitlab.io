 <p>Bang Bang!</p>
 <p>The gigantic glowing array in the sky spread out. Boundless and majestic energy flooded out from within, while an astonishing aura started to radiate out from it.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>As the giant array took shape, the eighteen withered figures had already flew over. Without any intelligence, they naturally did not know how to evade. Therefore, they had continued with their movement and rushed straight into the array.</p>
 <p>Humm!</p>
 <p>Just as they rushed into the array, the Ancient Universe Formation instantly produced a low humming sound. Boundless energy erupted out, before transforming into countless streaks of light that shot out. Forming a net, it completely entangled the eighteen withered figures within.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>This obstruction instantly caused those withered figures to emitted low roars akin to wild beasts. The black flames that covered their bodies rapidly swept out, setting the light net twining their bodies on fire.</p>
 <p>Chi Chi!</p>
 <p>Those black flames were clearly quite formidable. Once they made contact with the light net, it instantly started to shudder. However, it did not dissipate immediately. Obviously, the strength of the Ancient Universe Array was not to be underestimated.</p>
 <p>“Although dealing with them head on would be very troublesome, restraining them doesn’t seem as difficult as I had imagined.”</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong looked towards those withered figures who were struggling with all their might, a grin appeared on his face. With a change of his hand seal, bright and resplendent brilliance instantly sparkled from the Ancient Universe Formation.</p>
 <p>As those brilliance rays sparkled, solid-looking crystal threads started to extend forth. Finally, covering over the light net that had trapped those withered figures, it caused the bondage to grow increasingly tough and resilient.</p>
 <p>Following the support from those energy crystal threads, the raging black flames were unable to do much. For a moment, low roars akin to that of wild beasts rang out from the mouths of those withered figures, rumbling across the sky as they resounded out.</p>
 <p>Those withered figures clearly didn’t understand how formidable the Ancient Universe Formation was. The energy that erupted from within the array wasn’t any ordinary Yuan Power from heaven and earth. Therefore, the black flames that were perfused by the sinister aura were unable to achieve the same formidable results that occurred when they were dealing with those experts.</p>
 <p>“Huff.”</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong looked at the withered figures, that were momentarily being restrained, he gently exhaled a breath of air. Fortunately, due to the might of his Ancient Universe Formation, coupled with absorbing energy provided by the Great Desolation Scripture, he was able to form a powerful obstruction. However, despite so, he could not indefinitely maintain his restraint over those eighteen withered corpses, who were as powerful as a half step Profound Death stage expert.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Lin Dong, should I go and deal with them?” seeing Lin Dong’s actions, Mu Lingshan was instantly eager to give it a go.</p>
 <p>“No need.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong smiled, shaking his head as he replied. Mu Lingshan’s strength was only at the perfect Profound Life stage. Relying on the Life Death Coffin Cover, she might be able to deal with one or two withered corpses. However, eighteen of them wasn’t something that she could contend with.</p>
 <p>“Yan, it’s up to you.” Lin Dong said within his heart.</p>
 <p>Humm.</p>
 <p>Just as Lin Dong’s words rang out, the Ancestral Stone within his body instantly gave a tremble. In the next moment, a gentle white light slowly flew out from his body, before floating in front of him.</p>
 <p>Within the brilliance, an extremely ancient stone talisman could be faintly discernable, while an extremely mysterious fluctuation slowly radiated out of it.</p>
 <p>Mu Lingshan open her eyes wide as she look curiously at the stone talisman floating before Lin Dong. The fluctuations coming from it caused her heart to palpitate slightly.</p>
 <p>“Swish!”</p>
 <p>As the clump of light shook, a sound that seemed to be a horn call from the ancient times was faintly discernable. As the horn call rang out, brilliance erupted from the stone talisman in the air. Seemingly countless ancient figures were faintly discernible as they surfaced and appeared. Those figures had auras akin to rainbows, as though they were condensed from the thoughts of countless people. Those thoughts were their desires to protect the world.</p>
 <p>A roar from the ancient antiquity rang out from those glowing figures, before floating out. Transforming into eighteen white coloured cryptic runes, extremely mysterious and strange fluctuations started erupted out from their surfaces.</p>
 <p>“Rune of Defense!”</p>
 <p>A hoarse and ancient voice rang out from within the Ancestral Stone. In the next moment, the eighteen glowing runes instantly smashed through the air, shooting towards the eighteen withered figures.</p>
 <p>Roar!</p>
 <p>As the glowing runes shot over, astonishing roars rang out instantly from eighteen withered figures. From those roars, one could unexpectedly sense the appearance of a sliver of dread.</p>
 <p>They tried their best to break free as black flames erupted berserkly from them, attempting to escape the restrainment of the light net.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s expression instantly turned grave as he hastily manoeuvred the power of the array to tightly bind those withered figures. He understood that this was the most critical moment. If any mishaps were to happen now, he may no longer have such an exceptional opportunity to deal with them again.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The Ancient Universe Formation slowly revolved, as astonishing amounts of energies continuously descended from it wave after wave, tightly pressing down on those withered figures.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>With the Ancient Universe Formation buying time, the eighteen glowing runes had finally shot over. In the next instant, they pressed on the heads of those withered figures that were pervaded by the black flames.</p>
 <p>The instant the glowing runes pressed down, the withered figures, who were originally struggling, suddenly froze. Waves of gentle and mysterious white brilliance gushed into their bodies. Under the attack of the white brilliance, the black flames that pervaded the insides of their bodies retreated and disappeared at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>Looking at those withered figures that had froze up, Lin Dong gave a deep sigh of relief in his heart. Looks like what Yan had said is true, it is indeed able to dispel the Yimo Qi.</p>
 <p>Strand by strand, the sinister Yimo Qi rapidly dissipated away from the bodies of the eighteen withered figures. After a moment, they were finally dispelled completely.</p>
 <p>The moment the Yimo Qi within the withered figures had completely disappeared, the Ancestral Stone transformed into a white ray of light once again, flying back into Lin Dong’s body.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Lin Dong gave a flick of his finger, causing the light net wrapping around those withered figures to tighten abruptly.</p>
 <p>Puff!</p>
 <p>This time, the withered figures, whose bodies were originally as tough as steel, exploded up, turning into ashes, fluttering as they dropped down to the ground.</p>
 <p>After losing the Yimo Qi, the fleshly bodies of those withered figures had also lost their protection and became extremely fragile.</p>
 <p>Looking at those withered figures that had turned totally into ashes, Lin Dong gently exhaled a breath of air, before looking with glittering eyes towards the sky. Present there, were eighteen jet black pills, whirling as they rotated around. Waves of destructive fluctuations could be faintly discernable as the radiated out.</p>
 <p>These fluctuations were Death Qi.</p>
 <p>“Deathly Silent Pills!”</p>
 <p>A scorching gaze flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes. Clenching his hand, a suction force immediately erupted from within his palm, directly drawing those eighteen Deathly Silent Pills into his hand. Each pill was worth millions of Xuan Yuan Pills. His reward this time around was indeed rather substantial.</p>
 <p>After keeping the Deathly Silent pills properly, Lin Dong made another grasp, keeping the Ancient Universe Formation back into his body. After completing that, he nodded his head in satisfaction, before turning around and smiling towards Mu Lingshan, whose face was now filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Wah! You’re so formidable, big brother Lin Dong!”</p>
 <p>Mu Lingshan’s big eyes glittered and sparkled as she stared at Lin Dong. Naturally, she knew how formidable those eighteen withered figures were and even she was unable to deal with all of them. However, right in front of her, Lin Dong used less than ten minutes to cleanly dispatch them. This caused the little miss to feel a little worship towards him.</p>
 <p>After being stared at by the little miss in this fashion, Lin Dong could not help but feel slightly joyous. However, just as he was able to speak, a clapping sound rang out in a distance not far away all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Truly formidable. You’re actually able to dispel the Yimo Qi…”</p>
 <p>The voice that suddenly appeared caused Lin Dong’s eyes to violent contract. Turning his head around in a flash, he noticed at the crown of a large tree not far away sat a figure covered in red robes. At this time, the latter was gently clapping, while a sliver of amazement was present in his words.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong stared tightly at this mysterious man dressed in red, while the Yuan Power within his body rapidly revolved while his eyes were filled with vigilance. This red robed man had managed to appear at a position so close to him. However, he was actually unable to detect an inkling of him?</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong started at the person in front of him for a while before speaking out in a low and deep voice.</p>
 <p>“May I know who you are?”</p>
