 <p><strong>Chapter 536: The Mysterious Qing Zhi</strong></p>
 <p>Above the vast electric sea, the black clouds were rolling over and over while numerous thunderbolts rained down from the clouds, covering the heaven and earth in the process. Rumbling thunders were extending downward from the sky till the horizon.</p>
 <p>Somewhere on the electric sea, the atmosphere seemed to freeze momentarily. Two astonish-filled gazes were focused suspiciously on figure sitting on the head of the Green Dragon. For a moment, their brains seemed to be somewhat blurry.</p>
 <p>Qing Zhi did not speak further. Instead, he lowered his head and smiled gently while looking in the direction of Lin Dong and Little Marten.</p>
 <p>Under his gaze, Lin Dong finally returned to his senses. A complicated look was on his face as he stared at Qing Zhi. He then muttered, “How can it be….”</p>
 <p>It was indeed impossible. Qing Zhi was definitely someone from the ancient times. No one knew how long had he been alive. In fact, not even the bones of the practitioners from that timeline would have remained till today. How could it be possible that someone from that time would still be alive?</p>
 <p>“It’s impossible for ordinary individuals to live so long. However, it’s a different story for those super-practitioners that have transcended beyond life and death….” Little Marten slowly explained as it finally came to its senses.</p>
 <p>“However, that kind of level is considered extremely rare even in the ancient times….”</p>
 <p>“Transcended beyond life and death.” Lin Dong shuddered at this thought. That idea of such level was completely foreign to him. Could the black-eyed old man whom he met previously at the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet, be of such level when he was at his peak?</p>
 <p>It seemed that this Green Dragon Qing Zhi was indeed mysterious.</p>
 <p>“According to what I know of, there was a calamity in the heaven and earth during the ancient times. During that period, many elite practitioners died....” Little Marten sighed deeply.</p>
 <p>“A calamity?” Lin Dong was startled. For some reasons, he suddenly remembered a vision of the ancient times from one of the body remains in the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet. Those dark and evil unknown entities and even the black-eyed old man, who possessed the Devouring Ancestral Symbol, were difficult to deal with.</p>
 <p>Could it be that there was some connection between these two events?</p>
 <p>“Haha, it seems that the Celestial Demon Marten tribe’s inherited memories are not completely shattered, you still remember the ancient calamity….” Qing Zhi chuckled at this moment. However, Lin Dong discovered that this mysterious individual’s eyes were somewhat solemn when the word ‘calamity’ was mentioned. Clearly, the calamity seemed to be an unforgettable event for him.</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong thought of this, he secretly trembled with fear. Was the so-claimed calamity so terrifying that even an exceptional practitioner like Qing Zhi would be so fearful of it?</p>
 <p>“During that time, it was due to pure luck that I am able to survive. Haha. Of course, my powers at that time were not considered top-notch in the heavens. It’s only after that period of time that I am able to achieve some accomplishments. If not, I’m afraid it will not be that easy to survive through that calamity.”</p>
 <p>Qing Zhi laughed plainly. Then, he came back from reminiscing the memories of the ancient times and stared at Lin Dong and said, “You’re quite ambitious to want my inheritance. However, I hope that you have the required talent to complement your ambition.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes slightly froze. Without saying anything else, he cupped his hands together towards Qing Zhi.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Qing Zhi raised his eyebrows. Then, he slipped out his palms from his green robe. A lustrous green glow was spiralling around his fingers.</p>
 <p>“Tcch!”</p>
 <p>Qing Zhi pointed his finger outward before a beam of green light poured out boundlessly and formed a mini-sized Green Dragon in the mid-air. The scales on the Green Dragon was sparkling. Through that display of might, even Lin Dong could feel an aura of danger.</p>
 <p>“The inheritance that I’m about to give you is contained within it. Whether you can obtain it or not, shall depend on your own abilities!”</p>
 <p>Qing Zhi stood up from his Green Dragon’s head and waved the sleeves of his robe lightly. Immediately, the mini Green Dragon roared towards the sky. As it roared, the black clouds in the sky began to churn and roll frantically while numerous lightnings bolts began to fall from the sky repeatedly.</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>The entire sky was filled with thunderbolts and the scales on the body of the mini Green Dragon became increasingly dazzling. At that moment, with a swipe of its dragon tail, the thunderbolts in the sky exploded.</p>
 <p>As the thunderbolts exploded, the Green Dragon transformed into a beam of green light. Accompanied with a destructive shock wave, it blasted towards Lin Dong with a lightning speed.</p>
 <p>Before the green light even reached the surface of the sea, a huge indentation that was a few hundred feet deep was already being created on the electric sea, where Lin Dong was standing on.</p>
 <p>The green light was imprinted on Lin Dong’s eye pupils. His face was becoming increasingly solemn as well. He could sense the terrifying energy that the beam of green light contained, If he was to be hit by it, even if he had a resolute will to live, he would die on the spot! However, at this point time, it was clearly not possible to retreat. If he wanted the inheritance, he must obtain Qing Zhi’s recognition. Apparently, this incoming attack was Qing Zhi’s test.</p>
 <p>If he could not withstand the beam of green light, he could only obediently accept the Green Dragon Hall’s inheritance. Given Qing Zhi’s haughtiness, he would not be satisfied to give his inheritance to a mediocre individual.</p>
 <p>At this moment, surging Yuan Power, Mental Energy and Devouring Power were all activated and channeled frantically by Lin Dong into the Ancient Universe Formation about his Dantian.</p>
 <p>Tch tch tch tch!</p>
 <p>Five black-colored light pillars shot out from Lin Dong’s body and blasted towards the sky. The black clouds in the sky were being ripped apart and the thunderbolts within the clouds were disintegrated by the light pillars.</p>
 <p>“This energy…..”</p>
 <p>Qing Zhi examined the light pillars that were shot out from Lin Dong’s body with a surprised look on his face, “It’s actually Fusion Force? Yuan Power, Mental Energy….. and Devouring Power?</p>
 <p>“Devouring Ancestral Symbol!?”</p>
 <p>The astonishment in Qing Zhi’s eyes was getting more and more obvious. At the same time, the strength of his vision was rather vicious. With a single look, he was able to identify which three types of energy was Lin Dong’s Fusion Force made up of.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t expect the Devouring Ancestral Symbol to end up in your hands. Did the black-eyed fellow die as well.” Qing Zhi muttered as his eyes darkened.</p>
 <p>“Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Hand!”</p>
 <p>Five greyish-black light pillars shot up into the sky and materialized into five greyish-black ancient huge fingers. Then, the huge fingers lined up together and formed a greyish-black huge hand that seemed to come from the ancient times.</p>
 <p>After the big hand was formed, the nothingness that followed the formation of the big hand exploded. The faintly discernable shadow that was of heaven and earth appeared once again.</p>
 <p>Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Hand. This was the most powerful martial art that Lin Dong could use. And right now, the energy that was fuelling this martial art was his most powerful energy, the Fusion Force!</p>
 <p>In other words, this move was his most powerful weapon!</p>
 <p>“Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Hand… The martial art of Great Desolate Emperor... Such an unpredictable fellow….” Qing Zhi gazed at the shadow in void with a complicated look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Break!”</p>
 <p>The Yuan Power in Lin Dong’s eyes were almost coagulating into solid substance and squirting out of his eyes. His whole body was filled with battle fervor. He held up his head undauntedly and looked at the incoming beam of green light. Then, without any fear, he took a step forward and clenched his fist. The enormous greyish-black hand in the sky then came whizzing downward as well!</p>
 <p>Boom boom!</p>
 <p>There were continuous rumbling sounds above the electric sea. It was as if the entire sea was being lifted up by the huge hand!</p>
 <p>Under the observations of the three persons at the scene, the huge hand whizzed downward and collided ferociously with that beam of green light!</p>
 <p>When the collision took place, it seemed that even the dimension of space was trembling. A few hundred feet tall tidal wave, which was made up of the electric liquids, was swept up. This huge wave knocked Lin Dong, who was standing closest to the point of contact, a few hundred metres backward. Luckily, he was able to adapt to the electric liquids after going through half a month’s training.</p>
 <p>Snap!</p>
 <p>Even though Lin Dong was knocked back, his gaze was still fixed tightly onto the collision. Then, he heard a light snapping sound. Soon after, he squinted his eyes and a look of ecstasy extended throughout his face. That was because the martial art that ruptured was that boundless beam of green light!</p>
 <p>Going all out on his most powerful martial art, Lin Dong clearly obtained the ultimate victory!</p>
 <p>The rupture of the green light was extremely quick and violent. Within seconds, it was completely disintegrated and a faint green-colored rainbow whizzed out of the explosion. Finally, it shot towards Lin Dong from afar and went through his body.</p>
 <p>Green glow engulfed Lin Dong’s body. However, he did not seem to suffer any injuries. At the moment when he was being struck by the green-colored rainbow, he could feel that a series of boundless information frantically surging into his brain...</p>
 <p>Lin Dong spread open his arms and let the green light wrecked havoc in his body. Meanwhile, he closed his eyes and continued to take in the huge amount of information that was surging into his brain….</p>
 <p>Finally, the information that was surging frantically into his brain came together and formed five dark-green coloured, ancient words.</p>
 <p>Green Heaven Materialized Dragon Skill.</p>
 <p>The ancient words were majestic and sublime. Indistinctly, there seemed to be an indescribable imposing aura seeping out of the words.</p>
 <p>This was the inheritance from Qing Zhi.</p>
