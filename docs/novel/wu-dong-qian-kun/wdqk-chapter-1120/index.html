 <p>Chapter 1120: Cooperation</p>
 <p>“Unite the Beast War Region?”</p>
 <p>In the great hall, the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio were a little taken aback. Soon after, they lifted their heads and looked at the smiling Lin Dong, before speaking without any change in their expressions, “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“The three of you should understand the meaning behind my words.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong grinned before he continued in a inattentive manner, “The Beast War Region is like loose sand, in other words, a terrible mess. The only way to fight ‘Mang Mountain’ is to gather the many factions and form an alliance. Otherwise, I’m afraid that we will not be able to resist them.”</p>
 <p>“The Beast War Region is chaotic to begin with. How can it be so easy to unite?” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander coldly snorted and voiced his thoughts.</p>
 <p>“There are indeed many factions within the Beast War Region. However, most of them are attached to our four great factions. As long as this is our intention, the matter will be more or less decided.” Lin Dong smilingly said.</p>
 <p>Although Deep Lightning Mountain was currently rapidly expanding, it was still far from the level that Lin Dong needed. Yet, it was pointless to be anxious in the face of this situation. After all, one might end up choking if one ate too quickly.</p>
 <p>However, the present situation was a rather good opportunity. If it was really possible to unite the factions within the Beast War Region, Lin Dong was confident in gradually making Deep Lightning Mountain the main faction of this alliance even if it was impossible to directly obtain full control of it. At that time, it was likely that even the three other great Demon Commanders would have no choice but to integrate themselves into Deep Lightning Mountain.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander had an indescribable expression. They had long thought of forming an alliance. From a certain point of view, it was indeed not difficult if they were willing. However… once they formed a new huge faction like 'Mang Mountain', who would be the leader of this faction? The similarly cunning three great Demon Commanders had naturally also thought about the hidden ambition of Lin Dong to unify all the factions under himself.</p>
 <p>However, the power of their three factions were on par with each other, and it was basically impossible to make one submit to either of the other two.</p>
 <p>“Ha ha, we merely need to deal with 'Mang Mountain'. There is no need to go so far, right?” The Ghost Condor Demon Commander laughed dryly. He possessed absolute control in his own faction. However, once an alliance was formed, his authority would naturally diminished.</p>
 <p>“If there is a ‘Mang Mountain’ today, there might be a ‘Min Mountain’ tomorrow. Don’t tell me that we are going to do this again when the time comes? This is a solution that solves the root of the problem. Moreover, even though the three of you are well known in the Beast War Region, you only possess a small territory here. If we were to unite, our strength will definitely soar. In future, our territory might no longer be limited to the Beast War Region…” Lin Dong smiled and spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“Of course, if the three of you are satisfied with being overlords of your own respective small territories, take it as if I did not say anything.”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio’s hands abruptly tightened after hearing Lin Dong’s last few words as excitement flashed deep within their eyes. All of them were quite powerful and the ambition in their hearts was naturally not small. They had thought of trying to make a name for themselves, but from a certain point of view, they had reached their limits in their present state.</p>
 <p>None of them possessed an overly shocking background. Although the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander had some relation with the Dragon tribe, it was clear that he had barely any say within it. This was despite him having a strength that could match some elders.</p>
 <p>Therefore, even though they might be able to become an overlord of a territory within this Beast War Region, they would at most be slightly well known in the entire Demonic Beast World. Therefore, an enormous faction consisting of a united region like 'Mang Mountain' did not give them any face and had attacked as it pleased.</p>
 <p>However, the three of them had no solution to this sullen state.</p>
 <p>“Even if we form an alliance, do you have any way to give us a background that others will not dare to look down upon?” The Golden Ape Demon Commander’s expression fluctuated as he continued in a deep voice, “The reason Mang Mountain can rule over the Mang Mountain Region is because that place is within the territory managed by the Nine Phoenix tribe. The five great leaders of Mang Mountain have also all pledged their loyalty to the Nine Phoenix tribe.”</p>
 <p>“Nine phoenix tribe?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was taken aback. He clearly did not expect that Mang Mountain would be related to the Nine Phoenix tribe, one of the four overlord tribes. It was no wonder that even the Golden Ape Demon Commander trio was so wary of them.</p>
 <p>“We are aware that you have a brother from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. However, even he will have difficulty getting the Celestial Demon Marten tribe to back us, right?” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander said in a cold voice.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong glanced at the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander and said, “My brother is temporarily unable to represent the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. However, I can pull the Dragon tribe to our side.”</p>
 <p>“Dragon tribe?”</p>
 <p>The Golden Ape Demon Commander and Ghost Condor Demon Commander were stunned. Soon after, they looked towards the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander with strange expressions. In this place, only the latter had some relation with the Dragon tribe. Yet, Lin Dong had spoken such words in front of him, making this scene seem a little comical.</p>
 <p>“Tch, the Dragon tribe has always been neutral. It is impossible for them to agree to back us. The Dragon tribe has never given me any help over the years while I was establishing Blood Dragon Hall. Even less needs to be said for yourself.” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander ridiculed.</p>
 <p>“You are you, I am I.” Lin Dong slightly lowered his eyes. His faint voice also contained some mockery.</p>
 <p>“What right do you have to utter these words?” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander was furious as he sneered, “If you believe that you can get us to agree to your suggestions with these words, I’m afraid that you are a little too naive.”</p>
 <p>“Heaven Dragon Demon Commander, you better be a little more polite!” Little Flame’s eyes were filled with a baleful aura as he stared at the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander and shouted.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong waved his hand. His eyes contained some playfulness as he stared at the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander. Soon after, he gently bent his long fingers as a purplish gold light flashed and appeared. A purplish gold dragon seal was held in his hand as he lazily asked, “Heaven Dragon Demon Commander, do you recognise this thing?”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s eyes immediately shot towards Lin Dong’s hand. Quickly after, the Golden Ape Demon Commander and Ghost Condor Demon Commander saw the sneering look on the former’s face stiffened little by little as rich shock and disbelief replaced it.</p>
 <p>“This… this is the Dragon tribe’s Punishment Seal? Why is it in your hands?!”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander was stupefied. He immediately cried out in anger, “How dare you steal the Dragon tribe’s Punishment Seal? Are you seeking death?! Do you know how serious of a crime this is?”</p>
 <p>“Crime? This was given to me by the Dragon tribe’s Grand Elder. What crime have I committed?”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong smilingly looked at the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander as his eyes gradually became ice-cold, “I am the new Punishment Elder of the Dragon tribe. Do you know that as a member of the Dragon tribe, you have already committed a crime by contradicting me?”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s expression changed as he raged, “Nonsense. How can an outsider like yourself take the position of the Dragon tribe’s Punishment Elder?!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong had an indifferent expression. He slowly stood up, holding the Punishment Seal in his hand as his skin gradually became akin to crystal. An indescribably pure and mighty pressure swept out from within his body and enveloped the large hall.</p>
 <p>The surrounding air seemed to freeze as this mighty pressure spread, causing even the Golden Ape Demon Commander duo to have grave expressions. They could clearly feel the pureness of this pressure.</p>
 <p>Even an expert who possessed the most authentic dragon bloodline did not possess such a pure dragon pressure!</p>
 <p>The both of them turned their eyes towards the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander, only to find that the latter’s face was pale. As a member of the Dragon tribe, it was obvious that the pressure emitted by the Primal Dragon Bones within Lin Dong’s body greatly suppressed him.</p>
 <p>“This pressure…”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s eyes trembled as they stared at Lin Dong. It was as though he was peering into Lin Dong’s body. The crystal clear bones deep in his body appeared just like a coiling jade dragon. This ancient being gave off an endless pressure.</p>
 <p>“These Dragon Bones… could it be that you actually possess the Ancient Dragon Bone?”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander involuntarily cried out. He could sense just how powerful the Dragon Bones in Lin Dong’s body were. It was likely that only the Ancient Dragon Bones possessed such dense and pure pressure.</p>
 <p>The corners of Lin Dong’s mouth curled slightly, but he did not bother to give any explanation. It was likely that the Ancient Dragon Bones were already able to deter the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander. Hence, he did not elaborate. It was always best to hold back a little.</p>
 <p>“I made a trip to the Ancient Dragon Transformation Pool. Now, are there any other questions?” Lin Dong asked in a flat voice.</p>
 <p>“Ancient Dragon Transformation Pool…”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander muttered to himself. That was a sacred land in his heart. The Dragon Bone in his body was only at the middle grade. If he could enter the Dragon Transformation Pool, it would likely raise the purity of his bloodline. Unfortunately, he did not possess the qualifications to enter that place. Although he was also considered a member of the Dragon tribe, he was merely a fringe member and it was likely that he would even have difficulty being accepted by the Dragon tribe if not for his Samsara stage strength.</p>
 <p>“Heaven Dragon greets the Punishment Elder.”</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander finally recovered from his absent-minded state. He hurriedly got up and greeted Lin Dong with the courtesy of the Dragon tribe. The Dragon tribe had strict rules. Additionally, the Punishment Elder possessed an authority which was second only to the tribe leader. He understood that if he was to offend Lin Dong, who was the Punishment Elder, he would only end up suffering.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he had finally kept all the disrespect he had for Lin Dong. The Punishment Seal in Lin Dong’s possession had a suppressive effect against the members of the Dragon tribe. Hence, he understood that he would likely end up in an extremely miserable state if Lin Dong used the Punishment Seal against him.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong quietly sighed in relief upon seeing that this untameable and proud fellow had submitted. Soon after, he waved his hand and said, “I am the new Punishment Elder of the Dragon tribe. If we form an alliance, I will let all of you have the protection of the Dragon tribe. Now, do any of you have any other questions?”</p>
 <p>The three great Demon Commanders exchanged glances with each other.</p>
 <p>“Heaven Dragon, although it is very difficult for an outsider to enter the Ancient Dragon Transformation Pool, I might be able to think of a way for you to enter in future.” Lin Dong smiled faintly and said.</p>
 <p>The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander’s body shook upon hearing this. He lifted his head and looked at Lin Dong with somewhat trembling eyes as he quickly nodded in a violent manner. “I will obey elder’s orders!”</p>
 <p>This temptation Lin Dong offered made it impossible for the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander to reject.</p>
 <p>“As for the two of you, both of you have already met my second brother. He is one of the potential successors for the position of tribe leader in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. If he succeeds, he will control the Celestial Demon Marten tribe in the future. At that time, we will have some relation with both the Celestial Demon Marten tribe and the Dragon tribe. Both of you should understand what this means…” Lin Dong turned his eyes towards the Golden Ape Demon Commander duo and warmly smiled.</p>
 <p>The Golden Ape Demon Commander duo opened and closed their mouths as a searing heat rose from deep within their eyes. If they really had two of the overlord tribes backing them, it was likely that their reputation would shake the Demonic Beast World!</p>
 <p>This honor was rarely seen even in the entire Demonic Beast World.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after a brief struggle, the two of them faced each other before heavily nodding.</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong looked at those two who had finally agreed as a satisfied smile appeared on his face. Once they boarded his ship, it was not going to be easy to leave…</p>
