 <p><strong>Chapter 329 Vengeance</strong></p>
 <p>The noisy plaza practically turned deadly silent in an instant as countless shocked gazes looked towards the figure that had appeared on the plaza, looking as if they had seen a ghost.</p>
 <p>Many people in the plaza had personally witnessed the huge battle half a year before. Under the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s chase, Lin Dong had been forced to raggedly escape into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice. After being missing for a whole half a year, many people believed that he had died in that dangerous place, and even Teng Sha shared this belief. After all, even with his strength, entering the Mysterious Black Yin crevice would result in only death!</p>
 <p>However, when everyone believed that Lin Dong had already died in the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, now… a figure full of life once again appeared in front of them. The impact that this had on them was practically incomparable!</p>
 <p>A breeze blew across the plaza while everyone was dumbstruck as gaze after gaze firmly fixed onto the figure...</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong?! Lin Dong!”</p>
 <p>The first to regain his senses was Teng Sha, the frozen sinister smile on his face suddenly intensifying to the max in an instant. His eyes held a trace of craziness as they locked onto Lin Dong’s body. The expression in his eyes was a mixture of sinisterness, hatred and an unconcealable wild ecstasy.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, you actually really didn’t die?! Even the heavens truly want to help my Ghastly Puppet Cult!” Teng Sha loudly laughed at the heavens.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, when Lin Dong disappeared, all traces of the mysterious treasure were also lost. Now that Lin Dong had appeared once again, no matter what, as long as he was captured, they would definitely be able to obtain news of the treasure. As long as they once again obtained the treasure, Teng Sha would definitely utilise all means to break its seal. At that time, he would obtain the treasure within and unify the Great Desolate Province factions, completely entering into the ranks of the top tier Great Yan Empire factions. While he himself would become a pinnacle like existence in the Great Yan Empire and receive the reverence of tens of thousands of people!</p>
 <p>“Heavens, it's actually Lin Dong? Actually returning alive from the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, isn’t that a little too terrifying?”</p>
 <p>“Agreed, even Manifestation stage practitioners would face certain death if they entered, yet he actually escaped from there!”</p>
 <p>“It seems he did not learn his lesson even after escaping. This is the Ghastly Puppet Cult headquarters, could he have forgotten how he had chased into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice half a year ago?”</p>
 <p>“Humph, arrogant fellow, the Ghastly Puppet Cult made him flee last time, let’s see how he flees this time!”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>On the plaza, the countless people who had been stunned quickly regained their senses. Immediately, voices dashed into the skies, spreading out in the sky above.</p>
 <p>“This kid… is actually still alive.” On the plaza seats, Mu Lei and Wu Zong were strongly affected as they stared at Lin Dong’s figure, clearly unable to imagine that someone was actually able to escape from the Mysterious Black Yin crevice.</p>
 <p>“This fellow is too hot-headed. Charging at the Ghastly Puppet Cult now will result in not only him being unable to save his Demonic Beast, but instead also offer his life up.” Mu Qianqian’s lily-white hands tightly clenched as she softly sighed and said.</p>
 <p>“That might not be so!” However, just as Mu Qianqian’s words fell, Mu Lei’s gaze flashed as he replied in a low voice: “Lin Dong’s aura is a lot stronger compared to half a year before, it is likely that his strength has made great progress over this half a year. Moreover… did you not see that Mental Energy light screen, such solid and powerful Mental Energy, even some middle level Soul Symbol Masters are unable to compare. Lin Dong’s current strength is not the same as it was half a year ago…”</p>
 <p>“Father means that he is now able to contend against Teng Sha?” My Qianqian’s lily-white hands could not help but cover her red lips in surprise as she gasped.</p>
 <p>“Although this kid is sometimes a little brash, he always has something to support his confidence. Since he dared to once again charge at the Ghastly Puppet Cult, he definitely has something up his sleeves…” Mu Lei slowly nodded his head and elaborated.</p>
 <p>“Heh, the Ghastly Puppet Cult has indeed offended a very troublesome fellow. Let us quietly watch for changes, even if Lin Dong loses today, the situation will have been disturbed, heh heh, if he wins, given his methods, the Ghastly Puppet Cult is going to be in trouble…”</p>
 <p>After hearing Mu Lei’s words, an extraordinary splendor involuntarily flitted across Mu Qianqian’s pretty eyes as she looked towards the figure in the plaza. Could he truly be capable of contending against the Ghastly Puppet Cult by himself?</p>
 <p>If that was so, Lin Dong would truly be a little frightening…</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Under the watch of countless gazes containing all kinds of feelings, Lin Dong turned around and looked at the heavily injured and extremely miserable Little Flame, as a scarlet red color immediately covered his eyes and a maniacal killing intent surged in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>Little Flame also opened its eyes and looked at Lin Dong in front of it as happiness flashed across its eyes. It struggled to crawl up, its huge head moving towards Lin Dong as it continuously released low roars of pain.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s hand gently stroked Little Flame, while the smile on his lips grew increasingly hair-raising. He patted Little Flame and softly said: “Little Marten, look after Little Flame.”</p>
 <p>Little Marten flew off Lin Dong’s shoulder, and took a look at the Little Flame who had been beaten black and blue, as an icy look of murder flashed across its eyes. Soon after, it nodded its head and landed on Little Flame’s head.</p>
 <p>After seeing Little Marten guard Little Flame, Lin Dong still did not feel reassured. He retrieved the high class Symbol Puppet and directly injected a hundred thousand Pure Yuan pills into it, before allowing it to stand guard beside the two beasts.</p>
 <p>After finishing all this, Lin Dong finally slowly turned his body and gazed at the wildly laughing Teng Sha, as his calm voice tinged with a trace of madness rang out on the mountain top.</p>
 <p>“Today, I will massacre the Ghastly Puppet Cult, unrelated people had best behave!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing these words, the countless people in the plaza turned silent for a moment. Soon after, pity surfaced on many people’s faces, of course, this was naturally not for the Ghastly Puppet Cult, but for Lin Dong. Massacring the Ghastly Puppet Cult on his own, this way of speaking was a little too much.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Lin Dong, you were as sorry as a dog when chased by my Ghastly Puppet Cult into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice half a year ago. Now that you manage to escape by some fluke, you actually still dare to walk right to us and say these foolish words, you are truly reckless!”</p>
 <p>At the Ghastly Puppet Cult area, a figure was the first to sneer before stepping out as Vigorous Yuan Power erupted outwards. It as the one who had once exchanged blows with Lin Dong, Cao Zhen. However, the the current him was still stuck at the half-step-to Manifestation stage, still unable to take that step.</p>
 <p>However, in response to Cao Zhen’s sneer, Lin Dong did not even glance at him. Instead, he only lifted his hand as an extremely berserk Mental Energy instantly gushed out of his Niwan Palace at a speed that ordinary people were unable to sense.</p>
 <p>The Mental Energy attack was extremely swift and ferocious, practically no one could respond as they watched Cao Zhen’s body being bundled up by a layer of seemingly solid Mental Energy.</p>
 <p>This Mental Energy gave off a gem like sparkle and looked exactly like a crystal bubble which completely sealed Cao Zhen within it.</p>
 <p>“Thump thump!”</p>
 <p>When his body was sealed by the crystal bubble formed by Mental Energy, Cao Zhen’s expression changed. Yet, he was after all a half-step-to Manifestation practitioner and immediately urged his Yuan Power to the limit as he frantically slammed at the crystal bubble. However, the shocking thing was that in the face of the full force of a half-step-to Manifestation practitioner like Cao Zhen, the crystal bubble formed from Mental Energy actually did not budge at all as a few tiny ripples spread out on it.</p>
 <p>“Trash, I let you keep your life last time yet you still dare to appear before me. Since that is so, die!”</p>
 <p>A sinister look surfaced on Lin Dong’s face as his hand violently clenched and the crystal bubble swiftly started to shrink. From the looks of it, he was actually going to squeeze Cao Zhen till he exploded.</p>
 <p>“Sect leader, save me!”</p>
 <p>The pressure that abruptly intensified around him caused Cao Zhen to be horrified. He never expected that the current Lin Dong was actually able to use only a bit of Mental Energy to easily control his life or death, hence, Cao Zhe hastily shrieked.</p>
 <p>“Humph, little bastard, this is my Ghastly Puppet Cult, it will never be your turn to behave badly!”</p>
 <p>“Great Devil Lion Fist!”</p>
 <p>When he saw this scene, Teng Sha’s expression turned a little serious, but soon after, he sneered as a fist punched out. Vigorous Yuan Power transformed into an angry roaring lion which flashed across the sky and ferociously slammed into the crystal bubble containing Cao Zhen.</p>
 <p>“If I want to kill someone, no one in the Ghastly Puppet Cult can stop me!” Upon seeing Teng Sha step in, Lin Dong declared in an indifferent tone. With a wave of his hand, a black hole appeared outside the crystal bubble, squirming a little as it directly devoured the giant lion formed from Teng Sha’s Yuan Power, before disappearing with a jolt.</p>
 <p>The black hole’s appearance was extremely strange and immediately many practitioners’ expressions to change intensely. Evidently, they were somewhat unclear on exactly what was this strange move of Lin Dong’s.</p>
 <p>“Cao Zhen, if you want to blame something, blame the fact that you followed a useless sect leader that does not even possess the power to save you!”</p>
 <p>Casually blocking Teng Sha’s attack, a ominous grin surfaced on Lin Dong’s lips. The words Teng Sha had spoken previously had been returned to him at this moment.</p>
 <p>As his words fell, Lin Dong’s expression hardened as his hand abruptly clenched!</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>As Lin Dong’s hand clenched, the crystal bubble wrapping around Cao Zhen’s body abruptly tightened. One could only hear a stuffy ‘bang’ sound as Cao Zhen’s body was directly crushed to pulp, flesh and blood flying everywhere!</p>
 <p>The entire place instantly turned silent!</p>
 <p>Even the Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners were dazed for a time. Dark red fresh blood had dyed the plaza in an incomparable red, as if asura had descended.</p>
 <p>A half-step-to Manifestation practitioner was directly crushed to a bloody pulp by Lin Dong!</p>
 <p>All the whispers came to a sudden halt at this moment as gazes turned to the young figure. With the embellishment of the bloody ground, the figure was just like an avenging asura that had crawled out from the nine hells, ice-cold and terrifying...</p>
 <p>At this very moment, everyone knew that Lin Dong had not come here to throw away his life… he was truly here for vengeance!</p>
