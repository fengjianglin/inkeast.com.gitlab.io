 <p><strong>Chapter 434 Harvest</strong></p>
 <p>Dong!</p>
 <p>Amidst that blood-red demonic horde, a figure violently flashed by, before his vicious shockwind directly blew away all the demonic beasts in his way. Meanwhile, while his body moved, he continuously turned to look behind him.</p>
 <p>That figure was naturally Lin Dong, who had volunteered to lure away the five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts. Right now, he had finally left the battle arena. However, everywhere he turned to look, he still saw endless demonic beasts. Therefore, one can only imagine just how terrifying this demonic horde was.</p>
 <p>“Five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts. It is a pretty good haul.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes turned to glance at that five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts that were approaching him. However, the words that he softly muttered were enough to shock several people to death. After all, even a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner would die if he was being chased by those five powerful demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was a reason why Lin Dong was brimming with confidence. Right now, he could rely on his Blood Soul Puppet that he had successfully subdued.</p>
 <p>He was not one to take outlandish risk and the reasons why he volunteered to lure away those five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts was because he wanted to break the siege, and also because he wanted to obtain the demonic crystals inside these five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was currently at advanced Manifestation stage. However, after training over these past few days, he had improved as well. Therefore, those demonic crystals filled with Nirvana Qi were precisely what he needed now. Since Jin Mu and the rest delivered such a lavish gift to his doorstep, there was no reason for him to reject it.</p>
 <p>“Growl!”</p>
 <p>Just as this thought flashed across Lin Dong’s mind, growls filled with a bloody stench suddenly echoed out from behind him. Following which, his figure flashed before he directly evaded a gooey and corrosive liquid. Then, his body hovered in mid-air while he stared at those five enraged half-step-to Nirvana demonic beasts. As they chased after him, the surrounding demonic horde had unknowingly dispersed and created an empty circle around him.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong glanced at those five demonic beasts, before he took a glimpse at a distance behind him. This was quite far away from the battlefield and he no longer saw any other people. This was exactly the type of environment that Lin Dong needed.</p>
 <p>Blood Soul Puppet was a lethal weapon in his arsenal. However, he did not want to reveal its existence in front of the crowd. Therefore, he chose not to summon it immediately when Hai Sha lured the demonic beasts to his campsite. Instead, he decided to spend a considerable amount of effort in order to lure those demonic beasts far away...</p>
 <p>“I am curious to find out just how powerful the Blood Soul Puppet is.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes burned fervently. Promptly, with a flick of his hand, a red flash shot out from within his palm, before it immediately transformed into a fiery-red figure.</p>
 <p>Right now, the Blood Soul Puppet was no longer filled with a shocking potent killing aura. At the same time, its blood-red body, which sent chills down one’s spine, had changed into a fiery-red color. Meanwhile, there was a liquid flowing beneath its skin and it looked quite peculiar.</p>
 <p>Even though there was a change in its appearance, when that Blood Soul Puppet appeared, it still carried an extremely formidable shockwave. This shockwave faintly appeared and when Lin Dong sensed that shockwave, even he involuntarily swallowed his tongue. After all, he understood that based on his current strength, if he fought against the Blood Soul Puppet, he would probably be defeated in less than ten bouts.</p>
 <p>“Growl!”</p>
 <p>When that Blood Soul Puppet appeared, it was as if the five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts detected danger, as a tinge of uncertainty and fear flashed across their agitated blood-red eyes.</p>
 <p>“Go.”</p>
 <p>However, right now, Lin Dong evidently did not plan to give them any opportunity to escape. After he had ran for so long to lure those fellows over here, how could he allow them to escape. Immediately, he jutted his finger out before a command echoed out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>The instant his command sounded out, a fearsome glint suddenly flashed across the eyes of that Blood Soul Puppet, which had been hovering in mid-air just like a statue. Then, its body moved before it immediately dashed towards those five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts.</p>
 <p>When they saw that Blood Soul Puppet charging towards them, the five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts quickly retreated, just as if they had detected how powerful the Blood Soul Puppet was.</p>
 <p>Right now, their speed was definitely incomparable to the Blood Soul Puppet. Therefore, in the blink of an eye, that Blood Soul Puppet appeared in front of those five demonic beasts. As it waved its bloody fists, an indescribable force emerged in mid-air, before it viciously slammed against a demonic beast.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A bloody mist erupted from that demonic beast’s body. Then, Lin Dong was shocked to see that large demonic beasts being blown in half by that Blood Soul Puppet’s punch, before it fell on the ground with a loud thud.</p>
 <p>An instant kill with one punch alone!</p>
 <p>Rip.</p>
 <p>At this moment, even Lin Dong involuntarily sucked in a breath of cold air. After all, in order for him to handle a half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beast, he must utilize powerful martial arts and use his lethal Heavenly Bone Crocodile spear in order to kill it. However, right now, the Blood Soul Puppet was able to blast that powerful demonic beast apart with a single punch.</p>
 <p>“Growl!”</p>
 <p>The four remaining demonic beasts were enraged by the Blood Soul Puppet. Immediately, the red hue in their eyes intensified. Meanwhile, a shockwave that was powerful enough to obliterate mountains rained down on that Blood Soul Puppet.</p>
 <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
 <p>Since the Blood Soul Puppet was able to rival a Nirvana stage practitioner, the four demonic beast’s combined counter attack could do little against it. In merely a dozen bouts, under Lin Dong’s bewildered stares, those four half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts were completely blown apart.</p>
 <p>A bloody mist spread out and all the surrounding demonic beasts were so stunned by this sight that they no longer dared to charge forth.</p>
 <p>“So powerful!” The shock in Lin Dong’s eyes quickly vanished before it was replaced with delight. Then, he waved his palm, before the five demonic crystals inside the five half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts all landed up in Lin Dong’s hand.</p>
 <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>
 <p>Once the demonic crystals reached his hand, Lin Dong activated his Devouring Force before he unceremoniously devoured them. Instant, rich streams of Nirvana Qi gushed out before it coursed through Lin Dong’s body and caused the Yuan Qi in his Dantian to strengthen.</p>
 <p>“At this rate, I should be able to reach peak Manifestation stage soon.” Lin Dong muttered to himself when he sensed the Yuan Power flowing in his Dantian as well as the burning sensation in his body. These five demonic crystals are practically equivalent to several thousand Nirvana Pills. Therefore, by swallowing them in one gulp, it was naturally extremely beneficial for him.</p>
 <p>“There should be other half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts within the demonic horde. Since you have already came out, you should make use of this opportunity to finish them off. I believe it will help you to break through to peak Manifestation stage.” Little Marten appeared at this moment. After it glanced at the stationary Blood Soul Puppet hovering in mid-air, it spoke with a smile.</p>
 <p>“That is exactly my plan.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong gently smiled. There are countless demonic beasts in the demonic horde and there should be several half-step-to Nirvana stage beasts within. Originally, if Lin Dong wanted to kill them, it would require a considerable amount of effort in order to locate them. However, right now, without deliberately searching for them, they showed up in front of him. Therefore, how could he give up such an opportunity?</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was a decisive man. Since he possessed the Devouring Cortical, he had no need to fear the suppressive effects of nightfall. Furthermore, he had the protection of his Blood Soul Puppet and even if he met a Nirvana stage demonic beast, he could escape safely. Moreover, those powerful demonic beasts should be located deep within the mountain range and since they possessed strong intellect, they would not appear easily.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong waved his sleeves, before that Blood Soul Puppet once again flew into his sleeves. Following which, his figure dashed out before he ran towards another direction.</p>
 <p>The demonic horde in Thunder Granite Mountain Range is extremely massive. Therefore, as he travelled, Little Marten helped him as well and gave off an aura which enveloped Lin Dong. This helped to prevent other demonic beasts from attacking him.</p>
 <p>Thanks to its protection, in the following time, Lin Dong could dedicate all his efforts on finding half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts. Therefore, he had a pretty good harvest.</p>
 <p>Thanks to the presence of the demonic horde, in merely three hours’ time, he had found a total of twenty half-step-to Nirvana demonic beasts. These demonic beasts were spread out across the demonic horde and they did not travel deep into the ancient battlefield. This turned out to be helpful for Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Thanks to the powerful might of his Blood Soul Puppet, these half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts, which many people were wary of, were all completely reduced into demonic crystals after a meaningless struggle, before they landed into Lin Dong’s hands...</p>
 <p>As a fearsome battle took place between man and beast, no one expected that there would be a phantom-like figure freely roaming around, before he completely picked off all the powerful half-step-to Nirvana stage demonic beasts, just like he was harvesting wheat.</p>
 <p>The massive battle raged on in the middle of the mountain range and the fearsome battle finally showed signs of ending only when nightfall gradually faded.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong sat quietly on top of a large tree in the middle of the forest. As he lowered his head and turned to look at that retreating demonic horde, a smile emerged on his face. Then, he flipped his palm, before twenty palm-sized fiery-red demonic crystals hovered in front of him.</p>
 <p>When this large number of demonic crystals appeared together, a rich Nirvana Qi instantly emerged and caused Lin Dong’s eyes to burn fervently.</p>
 <p>With these demonic crystals, his strength would surge once again!</p>
