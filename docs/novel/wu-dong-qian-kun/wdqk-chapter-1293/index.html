Following which, the Flame Master and the rest looked at Lin Dong with a complicated emotion in their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong slowly lifted his head, before he stared at the pretty figure in front of him. Meanwhile, when the latter saw that his eyes were filled with fury, she clenched her hands tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Heaven Seat King saw this complicated situation, he gave a faint smile. Then, he glanced at Lin Dong before he said, “Do you want to know why? I can tell you the answer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven Seat King gently stepped forward. Immediately, his warm and friendly looking face became extremely cold and insidious. Meanwhile, terrifying demonic aura, which could not be described with words, surged out from within his body. In fact, his demonic aura was so frightening that they were even able to block the shocking cold aura from Ying Huanhuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if the entire world was trembling under his demonic aura.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Flame Master and the rest detected how terrifying his demonic aura were, their expressions began to turn solemn. It seems like the Heaven Seat King had indeed made a complete recovery…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s because if she did not do so, all of you will die!” The Heaven Seat King gave a cruel smile. Currently, with the support of his dense demonic aura, he looked just like the devil himself. It was a terrifying sight to behold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me try!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fury surged within Lin Dong’s heart, before a buzzing sound was immediately emitted from the Divine Palace between his brows. Then, he stared at the Heaven Seat King, before his body moved and he rushed forward. However, an icy cold hand grabbed his shoulder just as he was about to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Currently, you are no match for him.” A clear yet exceptionally icy cold voice resounded beside Lin Dong’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s expression sunk. He jerked his shoulder before he pushed away that icy cold hand. Following which, silver light glimmered on his body, before he appeared right above the Heaven Seat King in a flash. Then, resplendent purple-gold light erupted before a hundred thousand purple-gold dragon light tattoos roared in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong threw a punch forward. Immediately, the one hundred thousand purple-gold dragon light tattoos immediately transformed into a massive purple-gold dragon, which was hundreds of thousands of feet in size. After which, it roared towards the sky, before it tore through the empty space and charged explosively towards the Heaven Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are quite skilled indeed. However, this is not enough.” When the Heaven Seat King saw Lin Dong’s attack, he gave a faint smile. All of a sudden, he extended his fair hands before he swung them downwards. Immediately, two extremely deep black light flashed, before that large purple-gold dragon was directly sliced apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Heaven Seat King sliced the huge purple-gold dragon, a vicious expression flashed across his eyes. After all, he realized how extraordinary Lin Dong was and knew that such an opponent posed a major threat to his Devil Prison. Hence, he wanted to kill him as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this thought in mind, the Heaven Seat King took a step forward before he appeared right in front of Lin Dong. Following which, he straightened two fingers. Meanwhile, both his fingers were actually covered with black demonic crystals. This transformation occured after his demonic aura had agglomerated until they reached their limits. In fact, with just a single finger, he could penetrate the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Dong saw the Heaven Seat King’s attack, his pupils hardened. Following which, three different rays of light erupted from within his body. Following which, his entire arm liquidized. Meanwhile, within his arm, the strength of three Ancestral Symbols swept forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven Seat King’s fingers jabbed Lin Dong’s liquidized palm. Immediately, a muffled sound appeared before Lin Dong’s surrounding space collapsed. After which, Lin Dong’s body shook before he took dozens of steps back while blood churned within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his strength had advanced at a terrifying rate, there was still a gap between him and a top expert from the ancient times like the Heaven Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Heaven Seat King saw that his finger attack was only able to push Lin Dong back without causing any severe injuries, he felt somewhat displeased. Promptly, his body shot forward in a phantom like fashion. Then, he appeared in front of Lin Dong again as he prepared to continue his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as the Heaven Seat King was about to attack, an icy-blue figure appeared in front of Lin Dong. After which, she angrily jabbed with her delicate jade like finger before she clashed head-on with the Heaven Seat King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The demonic aura and cold aura swept forward, causing the space itself to vibrate continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties clashed. After which, both their bodies shook before both of them retreated by a couple of steps. After which, the Heaven Seat King gave a faint smile before he said, “Ice Master, why are you so upset? I am helping you to teach him a lesson after I saw that he did not understand why you had to make a sacrifice for the sake of everyone else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You aren’t qualified to do so!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fearsome glint was glimmering within Ying Huanhuan’s crystal clear pretty eyes as she stared at the Heaven Seat King. Meanwhile, rich and dense murderous desire surged from within the deepest part of her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you have actually lost your temper. What a rare sight.” The Heaven Seat King teased. However, his eyes were not smiling at all. Instead, there was only pure ruthlessness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t act recklessly. I will give you a proper explanation once this is over.” Ying Huanhuan turned her head. Her crystal long hair was dancing gently with the wind. She looked at the skinny figure behind her before she softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong stared intently at this alluring figure. A moment later, he waved his hand before he said in a tired manner, “Alright then. Do what you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, Lin Dong retreated. When she heard this, Ying Huanhuan involuntarily clenched her fists. At this moment, even though her emotions were already frozen, she still felt a little upset when she heard his words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was indeed not the right time to be talking about this. Therefore, she inhaled a deep breath and suppressed the emotions in her heart. After which, she used her crystal clear pretty eyes before she stared at the Heaven Seat King with a smile. After fighting for so many years, this was the first time she felt such rich murderous desire towards this fellow that it nearly caused her to lose control.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A frightening chill spread. Ying Huanhuan clenched her jade like hand gently before an ice spear slowly extended. Following which, murderous desire surged within her pretty eyes, before she finally lost control as her delicate figure rushed forward. Ice and snow swept across the sky before her cold sharp spear shadow, which could even freeze space and time itself, charged straight towards the Heaven Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, have you lost it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven Seat King laughed out loud towards the sky when he saw this. Demonic aura surged before he rushed forward instantly. After which, an extremely frightening ripple swept across the sky.</span></p>

Subsequently, her body moved before she rushed towards the Second Seat King, “Leave this fellow to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave that big fellow to me!”</span></p>

Following which, purple-gold light surged across his body, before his body swelled rapidly and he quickly transformed into a hundred thousand feet tall giant. His feet stepped on the ground before he charged towards the Cosmic Evil Devil King in a rumbling fashion.</span></p>

Then, he turned to look at Lin Dong before he said, “It seems like you are quite a pushover. How about I take you out first?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With no emotions on his face, Lin Dong walked on the air. Suddenly, a hundred thousand feet large divine light erupted from between his brows. Faintly, a Divine Palace seemed to have appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Divine Palace Master level?” The Third Seat King’s pupils hardened after he saw that Divine Palace. Only then did he understand why Lin Dong was qualified to stand alongside the Ancient Masters.</span></p>

After which, without further ado, a resplendent divine light erupted from between his brows before he dashed straight towards the Third Seat King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flame Master’s group nodded upon seeing this. Currently, Lin Dong’s strength was on par with them. Therefore, thanks to his Divine Palace, it was possible for him to fight the Third Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Seat King’s face was still filled with smiles. He flipped his hand before a devil light shot out from the evil eye on his palm, intercepting the divine light that had shot out from the Divine Palace between Lin Dong’s brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong moved and appeared in front of the Third Seat King. The Flame Master and the rest also began their attack, as they intercepted the remaining members of the upper echelon of the Devil Prison.</span></p>

Meanwhile, the terrifying energy fluctuations from them affected the entire Western Xuan Region. In fact, even the citizens of the other three Xuan Regions could feel them as well. Soon after, countless pairs of anxiety filled eyes looked towards this extremely distant location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are quite impressive indeed. It has only been a year since we last met, yet you have actually formed a Divine Palace.” The Third Seat King looked at Lin Dong, who was standing in front of him, before he said with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong glanced at him indifferently. Currently, he was no longer in the mood for such an unnecessary conversation. Immediately, his body trembled before both his arms quickly liquidized. Following which, the strength of three great Ancestral Symbols erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he advanced to the Divine Palace Master level, Lin Dong’s control over the Ancestral Symbols have clearly reached a godlike level.</span></p>

He seemingly teleported as he appeared above the head of the Third Seat King instantaneously. Meanwhile, his Ancestral Symbol palm, which contained vast and mighty Yuan Power, ruthlessly smashed towards the latter’s head together with a terrifying force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!”</span></p>

Immediately, his body shook before viscous demonic aura gathered on his body. Then, they transformed into a ferocious looking black Devil Emperor Armour. Finally, he threw a punch and clashed head-on with Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A palm and fist slammed together furiously. Immediately, the surrounding space began to collapse an inch at a time. The shattered signs were startling obvious and shocking, and they looked just like cracked glass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After throwing a punch, the Third Seat King showed no mercy. Many dark black sharp thorns quickly appeared on his ferocious looking Devil Emperor Armour, before he turned his body and swept towards Lin Dong like a hurricane. In fact, this attack was so sharp that it even cut the empty space itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, Lin Dong did not step back after seeing this. Instead, the glow from his three Ancestral Symbols flashed wildly across his body. After which, his entire body gradually liquidized. In an instant, the liquidized Ancestral Symbols strength suddenly solidified. Then, they actually transformed into a black, lightning and silver coloured armour on his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Following which, he threw both his fists forward. Countless black holes, thunderbolts and silver light formed under his fists. Finally, they ruthlessly smashed against that incomparably sharp black hurricane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang clang clang!</span></p>

In fact, both of them were putting their lives on the line with every attack. The force within each punch could kill an elite Reincarnation stage expert. However, they also relied on their powerful armours to forcefully endure the attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Lin Dong and the Third Seat King fought manically, the fight within the few other battlegrounds in the sky quickly heated up. After all, both parties had fought for numerous years and they were well-aware of each other’s techniques. Therefore, they were completely merciless in this all-out fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
