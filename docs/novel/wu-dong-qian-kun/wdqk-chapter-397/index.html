 <p><strong>Chapter 397 A Change in the Blood Soul Puppet</strong></p>
 <p>Atop his bed, Lin Dong suddenly opened his eyes, while a formidable and resplendent glow flowed in his eyes. Right now, both of his eyes were tightly locked on the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear, that was silently hovering in mid-air. He could feel that the viciousness and the resistance coming from this bone spear had completely disappeared!</p>
 <p>After imprinting his seal, Lin Dong could clearly feel a intimate shockwave coming from that Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. From today onward, this Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear would become a potent weapon in his arsenal!</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes were burning as he slowly extended his palm and gently grabbed that Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. When that bone spear entered his palm, that thousand pound-like heavy sensation had actually completely disappeared. Instead, it was replaced by a light and gentle sensation.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was only be reserved for Lin Dong. If he used this spear to attack, the force behind that attack would surely be like a hurricane and it would be very difficult for anyone to counter against it.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s hand grabbed on his Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear, while he jerked his palm. Then, he waved that spear while a deep splitting wind sound instantly echoed out. Meanwhile, countless spear shadows formed, before they viciously flew out. As those formidable spear shadows flew out, the tables and the chairs in the room were all directly ruptured into dust with a loud boom. In fact, a deep crocodile’s growl faintly ricocheted across the room, causing one’s blood to boil...</p>
 <p>When he saw this situation, Lin Dong gently smiled. Promptly, with a flick of mind, a potent Yuan power gushed out from his arm and poured into his Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear.</p>
 <p>“Boom! Boom!”</p>
 <p>As his Yuan Power gushed in, that Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear began to vibrate gently before a buzzing noise echoed out. Meanwhile, countless tiny capillaries on that spear began to squirm, before an indescribable formidable aura slowly extended out and enveloped Lin Dong. It caused his entire body to look like a formidable blade and he looked extremely sharp and deadly.</p>
 <p>When he realized how formidable this Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear is, a tinge of awe flashed across his eyes. If he fought with Lin Langtian again, he would be able to use this spear to completely dominate the latter!</p>
 <p>“Not bad, in five day’s time, you have actually successfully refined this Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear…” Just as Lin Dong was overjoyed over the might of his Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear, Little Marten flashed before it appeared. When it saw this sight, it involuntarily nodded his head. Even though the previous seal in the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear had been eroded over the passage of time, it had been heavily fortified by the vicious aura within that Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. However, Lin Dong was able to refine it in merely five days. Even Little Marten could not find any fault with that.</p>
 <p>“Right, check out the stone talisman. It seems like there is something going on with the Blood Soul Puppet.” After Little Marten praised him, it suddenly said.</p>
 <p>When he saw Little Marten’s words, Lin Dong had yet to recover his senses. After a few seconds, his pupils suddenly shrunk before he turned to look at Little Marten and hurriedly said: “What is going on?”</p>
 <p>With regards to his Blood Soul Puppet, Lin Dong rather valued it. In this Great Yan Dynasty, the reason why he did not have to fear Nirvana practitioners like Lin Fan, was because of his Blood Soul Puppet. Furthermore, at the same time, it was his most important insurance once he entered the ancient battlefield. If something went wrong with it, he would lose a key tool in his arsenal. Even though he currently had the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear, unless it was a life-threatening situation, he would not casually summon it. After all, he only had one vital of dragon essence blood on his body and after he summoned it once, he could not summon it again!</p>
 <p>Even though he still had Little Marten around, and that fellow is extremely experienced, it was merely a Demonic Soul. Therefore, if he encountered a Nirvana stage practitioner, it could only stand by.</p>
 <p>Therefore, this clearly showcased the importance of his Blood Soul Puppet. In fact, even Lin Dong did not dare to call it out for an extended period of time. However, it could be used more than once and he could use it turn the table at critical junctures.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when he heard that his valuable Blood Soul Puppet had ran into an accident, he felt his heart violently skip a beat.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. It’s nothing ominous. Go take a look first.” When he saw Lin Dong’s expression change, Little Marten waved its claws before it darted into the stone talisman inside Lin Dong’s palm. Then, with a flick of his mind, a strand of Mental Energy quickly followed behind.</p>
 <p>When Lin Dong’s Mental Energy entered into the Stone Talisman Spiritual Domain, he immediately went to the location of the Blood Soul Puppet. As he swept his eyes across it, he involuntarily sucked in a breath of cold air.</p>
 <p>Standing in front of him, was a solid prison-like crystal bubble with the Blood Soul Puppet trapped within. Right now, though this crystal bubble was still there, it was filled with a rich blood-red hue. Faintly, Lin Dong could feel an exceedingly vicious aura emerging from that crystal bubble.</p>
 <p>“What is going on?” Lin Dong stared at the peculiar blinking symbols on the crystal bubble, as he involuntarily asked.</p>
 <p>“The strength and the viciousness of this Blood Soul Puppet has completely exceeded my expectations. At first, I thought that it was at most a first grade Soul Puppet. However, after being refined by the stone talisman, it had brought out the latent venomous aura inside its body. This is what resulted in this situation.” Little Marten said.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” Lin Dong furrowed his brows and asked.</p>
 <p>“What I mean is that the Blood Soul Puppet is borrowing the strength of the stone talisman to force out the latent energy inside his body. Even though there are no huge commotions now, if the current situation goes on, its strength would surely surge. At that time, it would probably be able to break the seal. However, there is nothing we can do. Even though the stone talisman is extremely powerful, you are still too weak…” Little Marten waved its claws as it said.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s expression gently changed. He had never imagined that this Blood Soul Puppet actually possessed such intellect...</p>
 <p>“What should we do now? If we cannot seal it, it will immediately dash out of the stone talisman and the first ones to suffer will be us.” Lin Dong’s head was aching as he asked.</p>
 <p>“It is not impossible for us to continue to seal it. However, this Blood Soul Puppet is truly peculiar. Therefore, it is best for us to refine it as soon as possible, else it would be a hidden time bomb.” Little Marten said.</p>
 <p>“Can you refine it?” Lin Dong involuntarily shook his head as it asked.</p>
 <p>“As long as you give me approximately thirty thousand Nirvana pills, I can completely get rid of its vicious aura.” Little Marten laughed awkwardly as it said.</p>
 <p>When he heard its words, Lin Dong was at a loss for words. Thirty thousand Nirvana pills, even if he sold everything he said, he could not afford that amount.</p>
 <p>“Can you control this situation for now? After I enter the ancient battlefield, I will try my best to obtain thirty thousand pills and resolve this problem.” Lin Dong sighed while he felt somewhat desolate. He never expected that he would be forced into such an awkward state.</p>
 <p>Little Marten waved its claws before it said: “Summon your Heavy Prison Peak into the stone talisman. If you want to stabilize this situation, you would have to rely on the stabilizing effect of your Heavy Prison Peak.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong nodded his head. With a flick of his mind, his Heavy Prison Peak transformed into a black beam before it dashed into the stone talisman. Then, it transformed into a tiny mountain and hovered in front of Lin Dong. Meanwhile, a black glow flowed on the surface of the mountain giving it an extremely earth-like solid sensation.</p>
 <p>Little Marten waved its claws, before several dark-purple glows completely enveloped the Heavy Prison Peak. Then, it jutted out its claw, before that Heavy Prison Peak howled forth and directly rammed into that crystal bubble, before it slowly ballooned. Countless black glows poured down, just like a sticky fluid, before it completely wrapped around that blood-red figure.</p>
 <p>“Growl!”</p>
 <p>When that Heavy Prison Peak dashed in, inside the crystal bubble, a beast-like deep growl instantly echoed out. Then, that potent bloody aura actually quickly retreated. Meanwhile, its appearance once again appeared in front of Lin Dong’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Right now, inside the large crystal bubble, the Heavy Prison Peak stood straight, while countless black glow continuously flowed. Meanwhile, the sealed Blood Soul Puppet was right below it. It’s body faintly appeared amidst that flashing black glow. However, due to the combined strength of the stone talisman and the Heavy Prison Peak, its vicious aura had significantly dimmed.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong stared at this sight as he gently heaved a sigh of relief. Promptly, he released a pained laugh as he said: “It seems like after I enter the ancient battlefield, I must immediately look for a way to obtain Nirvana Pills…”</p>
 <p>“It’s no big deal.”</p>
 <p>Little Marten smiled before it said: “At the very least, this incident revealed to us that the Blood Soul Puppet is much stronger than we expected. When we successfully refine it, we would have an even more solid ace up our sleeves.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong sighed as he nodded his head. Right now, this was the only way to comfort himself. He was only at Manifestation stage and it was a little crazy for him to try to control a Nirvana stage Blood Soul Puppet. If he did not have assistance from the stone talisman, he would have likely been ripped apart by that Blood Soul Puppet...</p>
 <p>After he resolved this issue, Lin Dong waved his hand at Little Marten before he left the Stone Talisman Spiritual Domain. Then, he slowly tightened his grip on his Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear. In the following five days, he could only silently wait.</p>
 <p>For the Hundred Empire War, he had already made all the necessary preparations. Therefore, Lin Dong was curious to find out how far he could go in that cruel battlefield.</p>
 <p>Whether he could ascend and fly like a dragon or crash and become a ghost in a foreign land, it would have to depend on his ability and fate...</p>
