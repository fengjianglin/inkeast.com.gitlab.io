However, the entire world was still affected by the deafening rumbling voice left behind by the Heaven Seat King prior to his death. Moreover, that voice was filled with excitement and brutality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the ancient times, in order to win the great world war, the world paid an extremely frightening price. In fact, countless top practitioners died and the legendary Symbol Ancestor even had to ignite his Reincarnation in order to draw a close to the war. However, was the scene from before about to be re-enacted right now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the desert, numerous individuals were staring at the sky with pale looking faces. Although they were unable to see beyond the sky, they could vaguely detect a scent filled with despair. After all, they knew that if the Yimo Emperor descended into this world, it was likely that there was no one who was able to stop him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that the countless living beings in this world would have to suffer the miserable fate of being enslaved by the Yimo tribe?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yimo Emperor… he has actually escaped from his seal…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a lost expression in their eyes, the Ancient Masters stared at the universe. Meanwhile, a trace of fear was actually present within their eyes. If they were only up against the Devil Prison, they still possessed some degree of confidence that they could exterminate their enemies. However, as of now, even their desire to fight was greatly extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all because of two words, “Yimo Emperor”. After all, they have been through the earth shaking ancient great world war, and they clearly knew just how frightening the Yimo Emperor was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong looked at the countless individuals, who had sunk into despair instantly, before he involuntarily clenched both his hands tightly. It seems like they have been played for a fool. All along, they believed that the Heaven Seat King and his gang were their final opponents. However, the latter and his gang had no intentions of fighting against them. Instead, their plan was both manical and terrifying. In fact, victory will definitely be theirs if they succeed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because there was no one in this world who could block the footsteps of the Yimo Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, there is no need to be overly worried. Even if they use all their strength, the seal between the planes was created by teacher. Therefore, how can it be destroyed so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the crowd sunk into despair, an icy cold voice suddenly sounded. Subsequently, everyone saw Ying Huanhuan rub off the trace of blood on the corner of her lips, before her crystal clear pretty eyes turned to look beyond the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan formed a seal with her hands. All of a sudden, the cold aura in the sky agglomerated and transformed into a massive ice mirror. In fact, the ice mirror was crystal clear and it looked as though both the moon and sun were travelling past it. Finally, the image on the mirror slowly darkened, as if it was reflecting a dark and empty void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the dark void, the crowd gradually saw a towering, seemingly endless ancient formation. That formation looked extremely obscure and when one took a single glance, it caused one’s Yuan Power to boil. In fact, one’s Yuan Power nearly showed signs of going berserk.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many rays of light were stacked on top of each other, before they blocked everything behind that formation. However, the crowd was still able to vaguely spot a huge crack behind that formation. Moreover, that crack looked just like the mouth of an evil devil and there was endless evilness sputtering out from within. However, they were all firmly blocked by the ancient formation and could not invade this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this… the seal between the planes left behind by the legendary Symbol Ancestor?” Everyone looked at this mighty formation within the dark void, before they muttered to themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clearly, the scene reflected within this light mirror was the scene that took place previously. Therefore, the crowd promptly saw the light pillar of destruction streak across the dark empty void before it ruthlessly smashed against the ancient formation, just like hundreds of thousands of meteorites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they were at a great distance away, everyone could feel the world tremble the instant the collision took place. In fact, all the natural Yuan Power in the world quickly fled and scattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was staring intently at the ancient formation. Meanwhile, they felt as though their hearts had reached their throats. This was because the seal left behind by the Symbol Ancestor was their final hope. In fact, if this seal was really broken, then every living being in this world was doomed. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the light pillar of destruction collided with the formation, everyone saw a hundred thousand feet tall energy wave sweep out from within the seal like a thunderstorm. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, an ancient glow erupted from within the seal at this moment. That light looked extremely obscure and they seemingly transformed into a glowing elderly figure, who was so tall that he extended beyond one’s sight. Following which, that large glowing figure swiped his enormous hand, before that destructive shockwave stealthily disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Life Death Master’s group saw this elderly figure, they were momentarily stunned as they muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, many destructive shockwaves continuously swept forward. However, they were repeatedly blocked by that glowing figure. In fact, it seemed like the two of them were in a stalemate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was staring at this stalemate with their hearts in their mouths. Meanwhile, unwittingly, their hands were all drenched with cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was also staring intently at the scene reflected in the mirror, without even blinking his eyes. He had been to that place before. In the past, when he was refining the Spatial Ancestral Symbol, he had been to that place and he had personally experienced just how frightening the seal formation was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, although the devil avatar’s self-destruction was also extremely terrifying, it was likely no simple feat to break the seal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stalemate continued for a long time. Subsequently, everyone saw that the light pillar of destruction was gradually weakening. Clearly, its strength was being slowly exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earth shaking cheers immediately erupted in the desert. Indeed, even though the Heaven Seat King used all his techniques, it was clearly easier said than done when it came to breaking the Symbol Ancestor seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, there was no way the Heaven Seat King could hold a candle to the Symbol Ancestor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, when Lin Dong heard the earth shaking roars, he did not let his guard down. Instead, he continued to stare intently at the ice mirror. Meanwhile, as he stared at the ancient glowing light figure above the seal, an uneasy sensation suddenly surged within his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why was he feeling queasy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong lifted his head and looked at Ying Huanhuan, only to see that she had clenched her jade like hands at this moment. Meanwhile, her face was filled with a solemn icy cold expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Lin Dong was feeling uneasy in his heart, the seal between the planes, which was reflected within the mirror, suddenly trembled violently. In fact, it seemed like a blurry diabolical figure had suddenly appeared behind the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh.</span></p>

Suddenly, a tiny black ray of light shot out from behind the seal, before it ruthlessly penetrated the area between the brows of the Symbol Ancestor glowing figure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless individuals stared in shock at that seemingly inconspicuous attack, while their eyes were all filled with shock. Where did that attack come from? Moreover, how did it penetrate the seal between the planes?</span></p>

This was because they could detect a familiar fluctuation from that previous attack. In fact, it belonged to the Yimo Emperor.</span></p>

By taking advantage of the opening created by the Heaven Seat King, the Yimo Emperor had made his move. All along, were they planning on executing a pincer attack from both sides in order to destroy the seal between the planes?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, it was likely that the Heaven Seat King knew from the start that they could not destroy the seal between the planes on their own. In fact, in order to accomplish this step, they would have to borrow the Yimo Emperor’s strength.&nbsp;</span></p>

This would subsequently allow the Yimo Emperor to take advantage of the situation and find an opening to make his move!</span></p>

Could it be that the Yimo Emperor was probing using his hand? In fact, could it be that thousands of years ago, when the Yimo Emperor was being sealed, he had already predicted what would happen today? Was that why he decided to rip off one of his own arms and use it as a mole in order to prepare for his comeback in the future?</span></p>

At that spot, the ancient glowing figure was slowly fading away. Clearly, after it was penetrated by that tiny black ray of light, it had broken the perfect equilibrium of the seal.</span></p>
