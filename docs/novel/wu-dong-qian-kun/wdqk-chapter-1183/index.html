The chirps of birds seemed to join together in waves as it spread into the distance.</span></p>

One could see the azure blue sky slowly distort at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack.</span></p>

A huge spatial crack slowly appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following the tearing of space, a baleful aura that could fill the sky swept out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This baleful aura slowly spread as the temperature of the area gradually dropped. After which, the spatial crack slowly shook and a skinny figure was the first to step out from within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those pitch-black eyes looked towards the land the moment he stepped out from the spatial crack.

He deeply inhaled a breath of cool air that belonged to this region and muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space behind Lin Dong shook as a couple of figures walked out. Soon after, the baleful aura suddenly strengthened. Countless figures with ferocious auras seemed to cover the sky and land as they rushed out and gathered behind Lin Dong. Although there were so many of them, not the slightest unusual sound was emitted. Their movement and breathing made them appear like a single entity, a sight that was rather shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this the Eastern Xuan Region? I have never been here before.” Liu Qing observed the area and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother, where are we?” Little Flame looked around before asking. Although he was certain that they had arrived in the Eastern Xuan Region, given how vast it was, no one knew where they had landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will know when we walk around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong waved his hand. His eyes looked to his front as his body shot forward. Everyone, including the eight thousand strong Tiger Devouring Army, immediately followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were extremely quick. Within a short ten minutes or so, they had already travelled a thousands of miles. However, the earlier peacefulness no longer existed. All that entered their eyes was a torn and tattered land. It looked as if the land had experienced a terrible war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that the war started by Yuan Gate has enveloped the entire Eastern Xuan Region.” Little Marten frowned and said as he watched this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong nodded. He had seen many people fleeing along the way. However, most of these were ordinary folk and the strongest amongst them was only within the three creation stages. With such strength, they did not even have the ability to discover any signs of Lin Dong’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is a large group heading towards us from in front. Some of them seem to have a little ability.” First elder Zhu Li suddenly looked forward and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s Mental Energy swept forth upon hearing this. He discovered that there were over ten thousand people in this group. Their overall strength was much stronger than the groups they had seen earlier. Moreover, one of them seemed to have reached the initial Profound Death stage. Even in the super sects, such a strength would allow one to have an elder position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these people wore an express of panic and were clearly from a defeated party. The only thing to find out was where they came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother?” Little Flame looked at Lin Dong to get the latter’s opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need to waste time.” Lin Dong shook his head. The Eastern Xuan Region was currently extremely chaotic. Most of it was due to the war between the empires under Yuan Gate and those under the other super sects. They did not have the mood to bother with a fight of this level. Once they finished off Yuan Gate, all of the chaos would naturally disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Flame nodded upon hearing this. He was just about to wave his hand and give the order when he saw Lin Dong’s expression suddenly freeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.” Lin Dong narrowed his eyes and peered into the distance as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?” Little Flame also looked into the distance and inquired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There seems to be an acquaintance…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled faintly. His expression seemed to suggest that he was reminiscing the past. Just how many years had it been?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A somewhat miserable flood of people surged past on the road. They gazed behind them from time to time with eyes filled with anxiety and panic. At the very front of this group was a pale faced middle-aged woman travelling with great speed. She seemed to be seriously injured and was unable to endure such torment. Muffled moans continuously emerged her throat as blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Martial aunt Mo, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cry of alarm came from the side as a lady hurriedly moved closer to her. This lady was wearing a blue dress. Her face was pretty and her slim body was like the willows on the lakeside, giving her an extremely alluring appearance. At this moment, she was looking at the middle-aged woman with a worried expression. Her tone was filled with concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lan Ying, I’m fine. If they manage to catch up, I will go and stop them. You will immediately lead everyone back to the Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. They will be safe only after reaching it!” The middle-aged woman shook her head and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But martial aunt, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No more nonsense. These are all that is left of your Celestial Empire’s imperial family. Do you wish for your entire clan to be wiped out?” The middle-aged woman’s eyes turned stern as she said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Ying bit her red lips tightly upon seeing this and fresh blood came flowing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged woman called martial aunt Mo also sighed softly in despair. She was about to speak when her expression changed drastically. She hurriedly lifted her head and looked to her front. “Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large group immediately slowed in a miserable fashion as many pairs of eyes looked to their front. Their expressions changed. After which, thousands of spear wielding troops rushed forward, guarding the group from the front. Their eyes were filled with caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a large black army stood in the sky to their front. The baleful aura that seeped out from the bodies of these people was extremely dense, and caused even the air itself to solidify.</span></p>

This sight caused her to have difficulty breathing.</span></p>

Instead, it was the ten figures at the front of the group that did so. Every single one of them caused her heart to tremble.</span></p>

However, she quickly opened her mouth and said. This was because she did not feel any hostility from this mysterious army.</span></p>

She hurriedly got down from her horse and respectfully said, “Elders, may I know who you are? This junior is Mo Yun, an elder of the Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. I hope that elders will forgive us if we have offended you in any way.”</span></p>

With their approach, the frightening baleful aura caused the faces of Lan Ying’s group to pale. Their hearts were filled with uncertainty. Just what faction did this mysterious group in front of them belong to? Such a lineup was something that even their Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace could not produce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Ying and the rest secretly lifted their eyes as they bowed in respect.

However, a warm laughter was suddenly transmitted from the front. This caused her to be startled. These elders were actually acquainted with Lan Ying?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Ying was also taken aback. She exchanged a glance with martial aunt Mo. After which, she carefully lifted her head and saw a few people standing in front of her. At the very front was a skinny young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man was of similar age to her.

She was not careless just because this person looked young. The pressure from the latter’s body caused her to be unable to even circulate the Yuan Power within her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you… you are Lin Dong?!”</span></p>

Shock and disbelief covered her pretty face.</span></p>

Which Lin Dong?” Elder Mo looked at Lan Ying with a lost expression. She thought for a long time but was unable to recall such a peak level individual within the Eastern Xuan Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is that Lin Dong from Dao Sect! The same Lin Dong who was forced to leave the Eastern Xuan Region by the three great heads of Yuan Gate three years ago! He came out together with myself from the Hundred Empire War back then!” Lan Ying hurriedly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Dao Sect’s Lin Dong?”</span></p>

She suddenly recalled something and shock quickly surged on her face. Her eyes looked as though she was seeing a ghost when she looked to the smiling young man in front of her again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ha ha, it seems that miss Lan Ying still remembers me.”</span></p>

He looked at the familiar pretty face of Lan Ying and felt somewhat emotional. Everything had changed now that they had met again so many years later. Lin Dong had quite a good impression of this Lan Ying in the Hundred Empire War. At the very least, the latter did not look down on him just because he was from a low rank empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… I heard that you were forced to leave the Eastern Xuan Region by the three great heads of Yuan Gate… I never imagined that you are still alive… Do you know? Martial junior Su Rou frequently thinks about you. And martial senior Qingzhu. She also mentioned you. They will definitely be extremely happy to learn that you are still alive.” Lan Ying’s pretty face became a little flushed from her excitement. Even her voice had become a lot more hurried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Su Rou…”</span></p>

Soon after, however, a complicated emotion rose within his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu.</span></p>

It was precisely because of her that Lin Dong had left the small Great Yan Empire. Regardless of what had changed, Lin Dong knew that he would never forget the only lady whom he had performed intimate acts with. He wondered how she fared over the years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough.”</span></p>

The present Lin Dong was clearly no longer that tender Dao Sect disciple from back then. Based on the order in which this group of people in front of them stood, it was obvious that Lin Dong was the leader. Moreover, the most terrifying thing was that the strength of these people were not weaker than the palace master of their Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was really unable to imagine how a Dao Sect disciple could become so frightening within a short three years.</span></p>

She immediately let loose a cry and hurriedly took a step back.</span></p>

He was about to speak when the expression in his eyes hardened. Those indifferent eyes looked into the distant where a large group of people were rushing towards them. Some strong individuals were also hurrying over in the air. These people had extraordinary auras.</span></p>

His body moved and disappeared. A short while later, a miserable cry was suddenly transmitted from behind. Lan Ying and the others hurriedly turned their heads. Next, they saw the strong individuals from Yuan Gate, whom even martial aunt Mo could not beat, being killed in an instant. Moreover, they did not even have the power to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh.</span></p>

There were not traces of blood on his body. However, the powerful intimidating aura caused those behind Lan Ying to tremble as they tightly sealed their mouths.</span></p>

Her face had turned a little red because she had escaped the danger. She quickly thanked him with gratitude.</span></p>

He said, “Miss Lan Ying, do you know which part of the Eastern Xuan Region we are in?”</span></p>

The Celestial Empire was under Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. Since Yuan Gate had declared war on Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, it would naturally not let off these subordinate empires.</span></p>

All of us have been fleeing from Yuan Gate during this period of time. It has been a long time since we have received information from the palace.
