 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong finally understood the meaning of “Purgatory” after entering this place. In this place, he no longer had his formidable physical body and his majestic Yuan Power. Instead, all he had was his pathetic Mental Energy body. With his current Mental Energy body, any one of these trials in “Purgatory” could easily kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after one entered this place, there was no turning back. Moreover, he was not qualified to make a decision. Therefore, all he could do was to persevere on. Otherwise, the only thing awaiting him would be death.&nbsp;</span></p>

Fortunately, this was within Lin Dong’s expectations. There was no strength in this world that came for free. After all, if it was so easy to reach the Symbol Grandmaster level, there wouldn’t be so few of them in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to metamorphosize, it was natural that one had to experience endless pain.</span></p>

Meanwhile, the yellowish ground had already turned white. A cold chill, that was visible to the naked eye, permeated the entire place. In fact, even the air itself showed signs of crystallization.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At a certain corner of this snowy land, a skinny figure was trembling while snowflakes fell around him. Currently, he was seated on the ground with a dark green glow undulated on his skin. His blood, muscles and bones seemed to have been corroded by the chilly air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi chi.</span></p>

However, no blood flowed out from those wounds and he looked just like a withered corpse.</span></p>

A lethargic aura was scattered around his body and he looked just like a dead person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sharp blade-like snowflakes continued to brush past his body before bloody wounds continuously emerged. However, he did not budge at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

The snowflakes and hail, which drifted down from the sky, finally began to gradually weaken before they completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the snowflakes disappeared, the chill, which permeated the entire place, also began to dissipate a little at a time.</span></p>

After which, his body began to tremble violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clenching both his hands tightly, his nails pierced into his palms. After which, his wounds, which covered his entire body, gradually began to turn scarlet. Subsequently, blood spurted out from them just like a fountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, he became a person completely covered with blood.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was like the sound of a dying beast, as it reverberated across the land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, he was kneeling on the ground, with his head lowered to the ground, while he pounded his fists heavily against the ground. Previously, his body was corroded by that chilly air, causing him to lose all senses. Therefore, he felt nothing despite being slashed by countless sharp blade-like snowflakes. However, the most frightening thing was that this intense pain did not disappear. Instead, it was accumulating and it finally erupted after the cold air dissipated and he regained control of his body. Moreover, this intense pain which suddenly erupted, could even cause a tough-minded individual to go mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That painful low roar continued for an hour, before that figure finally stopped. After which, his body collapsed feebly onto the ground. In fact, he did not even have the strength to move his fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damned… Purgatory.”</span></p>

Time in this place flows at a different rate compared to the outside world. However, Lin Dong had already spent two months in this place experiencing that abnormal torture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each day was spent in endless agony. Moreover, he would genuinely feel the threat of death each time. Although he had frequently toed death in the past, that sensation was exceptionally prominent here. That was because Lin Dong’s tightly guarded consciousness had nearly been lost amidst the terrifying pain, for more than ten times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once it was lost, his Mental Energy body would also vanish and he would no longer have the opportunity to return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The icy cold chill this time around is stronger than the previous one.”</span></p>

He could detect that the icy chill this time around was stronger than before. Clearly, the trials in this place were constantly changing and becoming stronger. Once his body failed to strengthen accordingly, he would end up failing to persevere on and would naturally suffer a terrible fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to survive in this place, one must get used to its cruel tempo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The constant, intense feeling of danger also forced Lin Dong’s current body to become much tougher after experiencing those frightening trials. The only thing that Lin Dong found comforting was that his current body was slowly becoming stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not his real body, but his Mental Energy body. In other words, his Mental Energy was gradually becoming stronger and he was slowly advancing towards the Symbol Grandmaster level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was improving slowly, it still gave him a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>

Then, he lifted his head and looked at the boundless land. His eyes contained a steely determination, which could not be extinguished despite experiencing numerous hardships over the years. Therefore, he believed that one day, he would be able to face Purgatory with a nonchalant expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just you wait!”</span></p>

After which, he struggled before he climbed up and walked miserably towards the horizon. That was because he knew that the next trial was coming soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The longer Lin Dong stayed in Purgatory, he began to vaguely feel that he was not the only one in this place. Moreover, this faint feeling told him that this person was likely the linchpin that would decide whether he could leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">　　……</span></p>

Moreover, the crazy trials, which could drive one insane, came continuously and left Lin Dong with little time to catch his breath. At times, he would even forget how it felt like when his body was not in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The concept of time was rather blurry in Purgatory. Moreover, time seems to flow at a different rate in this place compared to the outside world. The Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers might be peculiar, but they were indeed powerful.</span></p>
