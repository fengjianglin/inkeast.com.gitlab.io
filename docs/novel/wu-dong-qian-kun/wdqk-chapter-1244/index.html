 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was taken aback when these two words escaped the mouth of the Seventh Seat King. After which, their eyes peered into the distance in a startled manner where a lightning world was rumbling towards them. A well-built figure towered within the lightning filled sky. The thunderbolt under his feet leaped forward, traveling over a hundred thousand feet in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was also a little shocked as he looked at the figure atop the thunderbolts. Was this person the Thunderbolt Master of the eight ancient masters mentioned by the Flame Master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure was extremely quick. He was still at the edge of the sky when the thunder rumbled. However, lightning had was already gathering in the sky above by the time the thunder faded, and a figure appeared before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong and the rest were now finally able to clearly view this figure. He was rather burly and seemed to be middle-aged. With a head full of silver hair, his appearance was a little rough around the edges. A pair of lightning pupils were present under his thick eyebrows. Those eyes were filled with coldness and violence. A thunderbolt tattoo was present on his bare arm. An ancient and berserk ripple faintly emanated from it, causing the surroundings to tremble slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning in the sky grew increasingly dense and concentrated as those silver eyes of his slowly focused on the Seventh Seat King’s group, while an indescribable pressure spread from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have been searching for you people all over the world. I never imagined that you would actually dare to show yourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared at the Seventh Seat King as his low voice thundered across the area. Even the air seemed to shudder in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thunderbolt Master, you are really persistent!” The Seventh Seat King was grim as he looked at the Thunderbolt Master and said through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can I compare to you people?” The Thunderbolt Master said in a faint voice. His stern appearance gave one a cold and strict feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since I have found you, why don’t you tell me where those fellows are hiding?” The Thunderbolt Master stared at the Seventh Seat King and said in a deep voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tsk, you really like you boast as much as you did back then. Are you planning on fighting our Demon Prison alone? If that is the case, why were all of you forced into a slumber back then?” The Seventh Seat King laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At the very least, you aren’t qualified to speak to me in such a manner!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunderbolt Master said in an indifferent manner. Soon after, a lightning glow flashed within his eyes and his large hand suddenly clenched. Endless lightning gathered at his palm, turning into six fist-sized lightning balls. Lightning arcs danced wildly over the lightning balls as a destructive ripple spread from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not show any courtesy. With a wave of his hand, the six lightning ball disappeared. In the next moment, they had already shot out from the space behind the Seventh Seat King’s group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seventh Seat King hurriedly turned around as monstrous Demonic Qi surged. A hand covered by the Devil Emperor Armor threw a punch and ruthlessly smashed onto the lightning balls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning glow spread wildly as a moan emerged from the Seventh Seat King’s throat. His body was sent flying a thousand feet back and his arm had been charred black. It was likely that just this attack alone would have crippled one of his arms if not for the protection of the Devil Emperor Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Seventh Seat King had blocked this attack, the other five Yimo kings did not possess the strength to do so. The lightning balls rushed at them and the Demonic Qi on their bodies crumbled almost instantly. Incomparably violent thunderbolt power erupted in front of them and the five of them emitted a miserable screech. After which, their bodies began to melt away at a frightening speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within a short period of time, five Reincarnation stage experts were killed by the Thunderbolt Master in a single move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was slightly startled upon seeing this scene. The two grand elders from Darkness Palace were dumbstruck while their bodies trembled violently. Such strength had robbed them of the courage to even fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” The Seventh Seat King gnashed his teeth in anger after seeing that the five Yimo kings had been killed by the Thunderbolt Master in the blink of an eye. Murderous desire erupted from the former’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will you tell me where those fellows are hiding now? Especially that fellow called Heaven Seat King. Is he still unwilling to show himself after hiding for tens of thousands of years?” The Thunderbolt Master’s eyes were emotionless as he said in a faint voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven Seat King?” Ridicule was revealed in the Seventh Seat King’s eyes when he heard this. “Thunderbolt Master, you nearly died at his hands back then. Yet, you still dare to search for him? I think it would be better to invite the Ice Master out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems that you are unwilling to speak…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunderbolt Master shook his head and frightening desire to kill erupted within his lightning eyes. After which, he took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seventh Seat King’s pupils shrunk the moment the Thunderbolt Master took a step forward. &nbsp;Demonic Qi exploded while his body turned into a flash of black lightning as he pulled back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are far too slow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space behind him was torn open just as his body pulled back and the Thunderbolt Master appeared in a ghost like fashion. Five fingers were tightly grasped as lightning danced wildly on his arm. After which, his punch heavily smashed onto the back of the Seventh Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning shot in, and the body of the Seventh Seat King turned into a black ray of light as it fell, directly flattening a mountain in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Thunderbolt Master extended two fingers and pressed them onto the air. Frightening lightning spluttered out and viciously dashed towards the collapsed mountain. Soon after, the rubble was turned into dust. The figure within could not dodge in time and was blasted by the lightning. A mouthful of black blood was spat out and his body was smeared across the ground, creating a hundred thousand feet deep scar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seventh Seat King, who had forced Lin Dong into an extremely dangerous situation, had been utterly crushed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seventh Seat King miserably pushed himself up from the ground. His eyes dripped with venom as he maliciously glared at the Thunderbolt Master. There were many dents on the Devil Emperor Armor on his body. His strength was equivalent to someone who had experienced two Reincarnation Tribulations. The Thunderbolt Master however, was a peak level expert who had already experienced three Reincarnation Tribulations. Without the protection of the Devil Emperor Armor, he would now be seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has been so many years, yet you are still only able to rely on this tortoise shell of yours.” The Thunderbolt Master looked at the ragged figure of the Seventh Seat King and shook his head. “This Devil Emperor Armor might be strong, but it will not be able to protect your life if I wish to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Seventh Seat King’s expression was grave. With a cold snort, both of his hands suddenly formed a seal. Monstrous Demonic Qi swept out as his body distorted. In the next moment, he turned into a dozen figures that fled in every direction.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was clear that all of them were the real Seventh Seat King and not mere illusions.</span></p>

In the next moment, the former’s body strangely disappeared.</span></p>

Lin Dong lifted his eyes and saw lightning appearing in front of a black figure as though it had teleported. The figure was shattered with a single punch. In the next instant, the bolt of lightning had already appeared in front of another black figure…&nbsp;</span></p>

The dozen figures had barely made any headway before they were blasted apart.</span></p>

However, it did not explode into Demonic Qi. Instead, the figure flew backwards as black blood uncontrollably spurted out. It was obvious that this fellow’s actual body had been forced out.</span></p>

Have you become stupid?” The Thunderbolt Master coldly looked at the exceptionally miserable Seventh Seat King as heart palpitating killing intent slowly rose in his lightning eyes.</span></p>

I will just have to kill you to prevent the contamination of this world.” The Thunderbolt Master clenched his hand and endless lightning converged in the sky. Finally, it turned into a ten thousand feet large lightning seal which gave off an incomparably berserk fluctuation.</span></p>

It was accompanied by a destructive power as it ruthlessly crushed the Seventh Seat King, causing the land to crumble and instantly creating a deep abyss.</span></p>

Monstrous Demonic Qi surged as he forcefully resisted the lightning seal. However, his Demonic Qi grew increasingly weak and thin under the suppression of the lightning seal.</span></p>

However, just as it was about to crush the Seventh Seat King, the space behind him was suddenly torn apart, forming a ten thousand feet crack in space. After which, a ten thousand feet large devil hand suddenly extended from the crack and forcibly blocked the lightning seal, before flinging it away.</span></p>

Therefore, there is no need to waste your strength. You can be reassured that there will ultimately be a battle between our Devil Prison and you ancient masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The devil like figure laughed softly. Soon after, his eyes looked towards Lin Dong and said, “You are that Lin Dong right? How extraordinary. It is unexpected that even old number seven has failed. Consider yourself lucky this time…”</span></p>

The thunderbolts that filled the sky turned into a hundred thousand feet large lightning lion that pounced forth. It was accompanied by an incomparably wild and violent power as it charged towards the Fifth Seat King.</span></p>
