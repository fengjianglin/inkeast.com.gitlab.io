Meanwhile, countless powerful experts from the alliance army had pale expressions on their faces as they stared at the huge ice mirror in the sky. As of now, although the seal between the planes was still reflected in the ice mirror, as the ancient glowing figure slowly disappeared, it was clear that the main backbone of the formation would gradually weaken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After its backbone was broken, was the seal between the planes still able to block the Yimo Emperor, who had already escaped from his own seal?</span></p>

Was this the end result of all their hard work?</span></p>

After which, they lifted their heads, before they looked at the delicate and alluring figure in the sky. Currently, she was standing in the sky, while her crystal long hair was dancing with the wind. At this juncture, she was most likely the only one who could possibly reverse the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it was because they had detected where the Life Death Master’s group had directed their attention, countless experts from the alliance army also began to turn their heads, before they focused their attention on Ying Huanhuan. After all, based on the words left behind by the Symbol Ancestor before he vanished, it was clear that the key to turning things around lied with the legendary Ice Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps she was the only one who had the ability to turn the situation around, and save every living being in this world from the miserable fate of being enslaved by the Yimo.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was the only glimmer of hope that they could see amidst the despair.</span></p>

This pressure was as heavy as a mountain and it was pressing heavily on her tender shoulders.</span></p>

Promptly, he clenched his teeth gently before he turned his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the sky, while she was being stared at by countless individuals with hope in their eyes, Ying Huanhuan slowly lowered her head. However, she did not look at these people, who were now regarding her as the savior of the world. Instead, all she did was to look at Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was looking into the horizon and it seemed as though he had not detected her actions. &nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, countless individuals in this place were shocked as they turned to look at Lin Dong in bewilderment. Clearly, they could not fathom the relationship between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stalemate between the two of them continued for a long time. Finally, Lin Dong curled his lips, before he turned around and looked directly at Ying Huanhuan. Meanwhile, the latter’s crystal clear eyes were quietly staring at his. In fact, it seemed as though there was an extremely complicated emotion flowing within them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Lin Dong saw her eyes, he felt a flash of uncertainty within his heart.</span></p>

However, if the Yimo Emperor wants to destroy the seal left behind by teacher, he would need at least a year to do so.” Ying Huanhuan’s voice reverberated through the sky, causing everyone to rejoice while fretting at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were rejoicing because they still had one year left. However, they were fretting over what would happen after one year.</span></p>

If we want to stop doomsday from arriving in one year’s time, there is only one solution.” Ying Huanhuan lowered her pretty eyes before she softly said, “That’s to create another Symbol Ancestor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless experts were speechless when they heard this. After all, everyone knew that the calamity could be avoided if there was another Symbol Ancestor. However, how could it be so easy to reach the Symbol Ancestor’s cultivation level?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong stared intently at Ying Huanhuan, while the uneasy sensation in his heart slowly intensified.</span></p>

Meanwhile, her icy cold voice sounded sterner than before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Assist me in becoming an Ancestor!”</span></p>

In fact, rich and dense shock promptly surged out from within their eyes. However, soon after, wild and unrestrained joy began to climb onto their faces. If Ying Huanhuan was truly able to advance to the legendary Ancestor stage, wouldn’t that mean that there would be a second Symbol Ancestor in this world?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Death Master’s group was in shock as they stared at Ying Huanhuan. Was she finally going to mobilize that power in an attempt to break into the Ancestor stage?&nbsp;</span></p>

In fact, it was a long while later before he finally calmed down. After which, he clenched his teeth and said, “What are the odds that you will successfully break into the Ancestor stage? Moreover, what will happen to you if you fail?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan used her crystal like pretty eyes to look at Lin Dong before she replied, “Thirty percent. If I fail… my Reincarnation will shatter and I will perish.”</span></p>

Thirty percent? Why was it so low? Countless experts looked at each other, before they promptly gave a bitter laugh. It seems like they were overly optimistic. After all, how could it be so easy to advance to the Ancestor stage? In fact, even a legendary figure like the Ice Master only had such a low chance of success..&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the consequences should one fail were far too horrifying…&nbsp;</span></p>

This was something that he had anticipated. However, he still felt that something was amiss. Hence, he hesitated for a moment before asking, “What happens if you succeed?”</span></p>

What more do you want to know?”</span></p>

The latter hesitated for a moment, before she sighed quietly and said, “Little junior sister, at this juncture, there is no longer a need to hide it from him. If you fail in your attempt to break into the Ancestor stage, your Reincarnation will be shattered. However, if you succeed, it is likely that all your emotions will be frozen as well. In fact, teacher mentioned this before, that you are different from the rest of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed.”</span></p>

Following which, he stared intently at Ying Huanhuan before he chuckled, “How noble of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Putting it in this way, regardless of the outcome, there would be no happy ending. Why was this woman always behaving like this!</span></p>

Meanwhile, there was unquestioning determination within her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This staredown lasted for a moment, before Lin Dong’s expression suddenly lightened up. This was because he could see the helplessness and hesitation hidden beneath her determined exterior. Therefore, he softened his voice and asked, “Can it be someone else?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there anyone else that is a better candidate than me?” Ying Huanhuan’s crescent like eyebrow lifted haughtily before she asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Currently, I am a pretty decent candidate, right?” Lin Dong clenched his teeth and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, as of now, he had advanced to the Divine Palace Master level. Perhaps, he was a little weaker than Ying Huanhuan. However, as of now, there was no way he would lose out to any of the other Ancient Masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No way!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my destiny.” Ying Huanhuan softly replied.</span></p>

Meanwhile, his body was trembling as he stared at Ying Huanhuan. A long while later, he suddenly inhaled a deep breath of air, before the expression on his face became a lonely and downtrodden one. His voice was a little hoarse as he said, “Is this your final decision?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It is obvious that I currently possess the qualifications. Why must you insist on acting this way?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong gave a faint smile. Meanwhile, there was lethargy in his smile, which could not be concealed. Promptly, an indifferent expression appeared on his face as he said, “In that case, good luck.” After he spoke, he turned around and prepared to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait. During the final stage, I will require the strength of the Ancestor Stone and the Ancestral Symbols. I hope that you can control them and assist me.” When Ying Huanhuan saw Lin Dong turning around to leave, a bitter sensation gushed into her icy cold heart. However, she forcefully suppressed her emotions before she promptly spoke up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s body trembled gently. He turned around before he stared at Ying Huanhuan lethargically. Right now, up against his gaze, even Ying Huanhuan did not dare to meet his eyes head-on. Instead, she gently averted her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can I ask you one final question?”</span></p>

Then, he stared at Ying Huanhuan before he articulated every word clearly, “Right now, are you the Ice Master or Ying Huanhuan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan descended into silence.&nbsp;</span></p>

Clearly, they realized that there was a complicated relationship between the two of them. They turned to look at each other though they did not dare to speak up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong looked at Ying Huanhuan, who had descended into silence. As if he came to a sudden comprehension, he gave a faint smile before he said, “It’s just as well. Allow her to remain in my heart then. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, Lin Dong flicked his arm. Immediately, three ancient symbols shot out from within his body and flew towards Ying Huanhuan. Finally, a trace of blood flashed across Lin Dong’s finger, before he gently drew a line in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As that blood line was drawn, the three Ancestral Symbols suddenly shook violently. Faintly, buzzing noises erupted while an unwilling emotion spread.</span></p>

A trace of blood had actually appeared on the corner of his lips, while his face had also became much paler. It turns out he was actually unilaterally severing his connection with the three Ancestral Symbols.</span></p>
