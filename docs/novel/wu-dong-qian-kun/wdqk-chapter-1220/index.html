His golden robes was noble looking, while his handsome face appeared warm and gentle. Meanwhile, when he stared at Ying Huanhuan, a warm ripple rose within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ying Huanhuan felt a little uneasy at the manner in which that man was staring at her. Promptly, she took two steps back before she glanced quizzically at him and asked, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red haired man was startled. However, he quickly recovered and laughed, “Little junior sister has yet to fully awaken.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he mentioned this point, he paused before he continued, “I am the Flame Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, other than Lin Dong, everyone’s expression changed. Following which, many pairs of eyes were filled with shock as they turned to stare at that red haired man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flame Master? One of the eight legendary Ancient Masters?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To most people here, the name Flame Master merely existed in legends. Therefore, they had only read from some ancient texts that described how powerful this top-tier expert from the ancient times was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During that ancient great world war, countless Yimo would immediately shudder in fear upon hearing his name. However, this legendary top expert had currently showed up in person in front of them. Hence, how could they possibly remain calm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Flame Master?” Ying Huanhuan was startled upon hearing this name. Then, she used her pretty eyes to glance at him before she took another two steps back. Finally, she shook her head and said, “I am Ying Huanhuan, not the Ice Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You will be sooner or later.” The Flame Master smiled nonchalantly before he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard his words, a cold aura surged onto Ying Huanhuan’s pretty face. However, even before she could speak, a human figure had already walked over from behind before he stood in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Flame Master has arrived. It has been a long while since we met.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong looked at that somewhat familiar figure standing in front of him, before a smile appeared on his face. After all, he was loosely acquainted with the Flame Master. Back when he first entered the Chaotic Demon Sea, he had barged into the mysterious magma realm and found the latter in a slumber. Back then, Lin Dong even took a Divine Flame Tablet from the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Flame Master saw Lin Dong, who was standing in front of him, a tinge of shock flashed across his face. Although he was in a slumber back then, he could still detect Lin Dong’s actions within the magma realm. However, back then, Lin Dong was no different from an ant in his eyes. Therefore, he never expected Lin Dong to become so powerful after only a few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flame Master’s eyes were glimmering as he scanned Lin Dong’s body. Meanwhile, the shock in his eyes grew even denser. It was a long while later before he sighed, “Did you obtain the Devouring Master’s inheritance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong nodded. Given the Flame Master’s abilities, it was not difficult for the latter to spot this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flame Master descended into silence. Meanwhile, there was a complicated expression in his eyes. Back then, the Devouring Master ignited his Reincarnation in order to protect them. However, he had to sacrifice his own life in order to do so. As of now, since his inheritance was already given to Lin Dong, it was likely that the Devouring Master had truly perished from this world. This caused the Flame Master to involuntarily feel a little upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the two of them were talking, Ying Huanhuan was slightly startled as she stared at the figure standing in front of her. Promptly, the cold chill on her face gradually faded away, before a slight arc was lifted on the corner of her lips.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is he jealous? This is truly a rare sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With slight joy in her heart, Ying Huanhuan extended her icy hand before she gently held Lin Dong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The icy cool sensation suddenly transmitted to Lin Dong’s hand startled him. However, he quickly recovered his senses, before a smile appeared on his face. After which, he gently held that icy cool hand and slowly increased his grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their actions were naturally seen by the Flame Master. The latter frowned immediately. Then, he hesitated for a moment before calling out, “Little junior sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should call me Ying Huanhuan. I prefer that name.” Ying Huanhuan shook her head slightly before she softly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong’s heart shook upon hearing this. This lass had finally became so understanding. After which, when he saw the Flame Master’s expression, he involuntarily asked in his heart, “Yan, what is going on with the Flame Master? You’d better not tell me that he and the Ice Master were a couple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cough…” Yan coughed dryly and said, “The Ice Master likes to be alone. How could she possibly have a lover? However, someone like her is extremely attractive and the Flame Master always had a crush on her. Nevertheless, despite his efforts, she remained unmoved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it is a one-sided crush.” Lin Dong came to a sudden understanding. He never expected that this renowned legendary figure, whose name was passed down since the ancient times, had actually failed in romance. It seems like the Ice Master was indeed a proud and arrogant person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flame Master remained nonchalant after hearing Ying Huanhuan’s words. Instead, he stared at Lin Dong and said, “In that case, I’ll listen to you. I will address you as such after you return to being the Ice Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong frowned. That was because he realized that the Flame Master was looking at him with a slightly peculiar expression. In fact, it seemed like it contained a trace of pity. This caused Lin Dong to feel a little irritated in his heart. Why did this fellow immediately conclude that Ying Huanhuan would transform into that darned Ice Master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Lin Dong was irritated, for some unknown reason, his heart also became depressed. As that mysterious emotion surged into his heart, it caused him to involuntarily tighten his grip over Ying Huanhuan’s hand. Promptly, the latter seemed to have detected his action as well. Immediately, she lowered her pretty eyes before she curled her hand and grasped Lin Dong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, I didn’t expect… that even the Flame Master has showed up. However, from your appearance, it seems like this is not your actual body.” An indifferent laughter was transmitted from a short distance away, just as emotions were churning within Lin Dong’s heart. Then, he saw that the Fourth Seat King was looking at the Flame Master, who had just arrived, with a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he heard those words, Lin Dong glanced at the Flame Master. Only then, did he realize that there was a faint glow being emitted from the latter’s body. From the looks of it, it seems like his actual body did not arrive. Instead, just like the Fourth Seat King, he had created an avatar using his formidable powers, which was now stationed far away from his actual body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wouldn’t you have fled already if my actual body came?” The Flame Master looked at the Fourth Seat King, before he waved his hand and continued, “Get lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Flame Master appeared extremely gentle in front of Ying Huanhuan, he revealed the might and domineering pride that belonged to one of the eight Ancient Masters, when he faced the Fourth Seat King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh, just a fellow avatar. Do you really think that I am afraid of you?” An ugly expression flashed across the Fourth Seat King’s feminine face before he chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flame Master stared indifferently at the Fourth Seat King. Following which, a crimson glint flashed across his eyes before the entire place became searing hot. In fact, even the clouds in the sky had turned bright red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud sound suddenly reverberated across the sky. After which, everyone lifted their heads before they were all stunned when they saw that a flaming meteorite had unknowingly appeared amidst the clouds. After which, it streaked across the sky before it ruthlessly smashed towards the Fourth Seat King.</span></p>
