 <p><strong>Chapter 276: Forcibly Taking</strong></p>
 <p>“Mu Qianqian, this place was first discovered by my Ghastly Puppet Cult, your Great Devil Sect better not go overboard!” Within the metal net of the Symbol Puppet lair, Teng Lei’s warned with a somewhat dark expression as he stared at Mu Qianqian and the rest nearby.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, Teng Lei, you should not say such words. Everything inside the Ancient Tablet space does not have an owner, and ownership should not be determined by who came first or later. Or else, besides the first person who entered, won’t everyone else not be entitled to enter?” In response to Teng Lei’s shout, Mu Qianqian merely covered her mouth and let out a laugh.</p>
 <p>“Humph, it is unknown how many people my Ghastly Puppet Cult lost initially when clearing out this area. To think that you people want a share of the profits today, how can such a good thing possibly happen in this world!” Behind Teng Lei, a Ghastly Puppet Cult elder had a dark expression as he shouted.</p>
 <p>“The treasures in this place will be obtained by those who can, what is the point of saying anything else?” Mu Qianqian lazily stretched, displaying her curvaceous and enticing figure, before chuckling: “Truth be told, we do not want much. As long as you give the high class Symbol Puppet below to my Great Devil Sect, we will leave immediately.”</p>
 <p>“In your dreams!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Mu Qianqian’s words, the Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners instantly roared out together in rage. No one knew better than them how powerful a high class Symbol Puppet was. There were only two high class Symbol Puppets in the entire Ghastly Puppet Cult, and even then, the two were considered broken. Yet, the two were also what the Ghastly Puppet Cult relied on to establish themselves in the Great Desolate Province and intimidate the other factions with absolute battle power.</p>
 <p>If they were able to obtain this high class Symbol Puppet, the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s power would undoubtedly soar. Hence, no matter what, this high class Symbol Puppet could not fall into the Great Devil Sect’s hands.</p>
 <p>Likewise, Mu Qianqian and the rest held similar thoughts. The Ghastly Puppet Cult already owned two high class Symbol Puppets. If they were allowed to obtain this one, the pressure on the Great Devil Sect would greatly increase. After all, in the Great Desolate Province, every great faction fought each other for benefits, and if a competitor’s power rose, it would mean that their own power would become weaker. A weak person and faction did not have the qualifications to obtain resources in the Great Desolate Province...</p>
 <p>Thus, they absolutely cannot allow this high class Symbol Puppet to be obtained by the Ghastly Puppet Cult!</p>
 <p>“Since your Great Devil Sect’s intentions are clear, don’t blame my Ghastly Puppet Cult for not giving you face!” In response to the Great Devil Sect delaying them, Teng Lei’s expression turned cold. His gaze slightly flickered, as he waved his hand and shouted in a low voice: “Stop them!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Teng Lei’s shout, the numerous Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners immediately shouted loudly in reply. Mental Energy and Yuan Power whizzed about, while a large portion of the group retrieved low class Symbol Puppets from their Qiankun bags, before ferociously rushing towards the Great Devil Sect to kill them.</p>
 <p>“Humph!”</p>
 <p>When she saw the Ghastly Puppet Cult make their move, Mu Qianqian also coldly snorted. Her lily-white hand waved, as intense black light immediately burst out from the Great Devil Sect practitioners behind her. One could see their bodies starting to swell and in the blink of an eye, they transformed into small giant-like existences, the skin all over their bodies glowing with a dark light, as they had been covered in a layer of oil, while giving off a feeling of power.</p>
 <p>“As expected, the Great Devil Sect specialize in cultivating their bodies…” Hidden in a secret spot, Lin Dong watched the Great Devil Sect practitioner’s swelled up bodies, as shock flashed in his eyes. However, it was clear that the body cultivating martial arts these people practised were far from being comparable to his Great Sun Thunder Body and Devil Ape Transformation.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>The battle below practically started in an instant. Practitioners from both parties ferociously clashed together, as a powerful force swiftly spread out like a ripple.</p>
 <p>“Teng Lei, let me see today just how far your Mental Energy cultivation has progressed!” While both sides were fighting, Mu Qianqian’s white foot gently stepped onto the metal chain, as her frail as a butterfly body dashed forward. Soon after, a wave of black light flickered on her delicate body, condensing into a slim black energy armor. The armor was clearly not oversized and instead completely displayed Mu Qianqian’s curves. The sight of her ample bosom and arced back would cause any man’s blood to boil.</p>
 <p>“To think that she is actually able to form Yuan armor. Being able to cultivate her body to this step shows that this woman is tough indeed.” As it stared at the black armor that hugged Mu Qianqian’s curvaceous body, Little Marten was also a little surprised as it commented.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong lightly nodded his head. The body enhancing martial arts Mu Qianqian practised was evidently rather powerful. After all, being able to form this kind of Yuan Power armor meant that not only strength and speed increase, even defense would be exceptionally strong. The defense of this Yuan Power armor would not lose out in the slightest to some middle-grade Soul Treasures.</p>
 <p>“It’s been half a year since we last met and you’ve actually practised the Great Devil Armor Art to this stage. This is truly shocking, however, just this is not enough!”</p>
 <p>In response to the fact that Mu Qianqian was able to form a Yuan Power armor, Teng Lei did not find this unexpected at all. Evidently, he understood Mu Qianqian rather well, as his body slowly floated up into the air, vigorous Mental Energy rippling around his body. Soon after, ‘pu chi’ sounds could be heard as Mental Energy fire appeared around his body. It was clear that this guy’s Mental Energy had already reached the Soul Symbol Master stage, and from how easily he was able to condense Mental Energy fire, it was very likely that he had already reached the middle stage Soul Symbol Master level.</p>
 <p>“Swish swish!”</p>
 <p>As the Mental Energy fire appeared, they instantly swept forth under Teng Lei’s control, leaving a trail of fire as they flashed towards Mu Qianqian.</p>
 <p>“Devil Termination Palm!”</p>
 <p>Faced with Teng Lei’s Mental Energy fire attack, Mu Qianqian did not dare to be the slightest bit slow, as this kind of flame could directly burn one’s mind. Immediately, waves of black light swiftly gushed out from her body, transforming into a huge palm made of black light that was dozens of meters large, as it ruthlessly slapped onto the Mental Energy fire.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>Though each wisp of Mental Energy fire seemed small, when they touched the huge black light palm, an extremely formidable Mental Energy shockwave erupted, directly exploding on the huge palm and causing cracks to form.</p>
 <p>“Teng Lei’s control over Mental Energy is not bad…” As he stared at the two’s intense battle below, Lin Dong was a slightly astonished. The fact that Teng Lei was able to reach the middle stage Soul Symbol Master level at this age meant that his Mental Energy cultivation talent was rather strong. Hence, it could be said that he was the same as Mu Qianqian, both could be considered as well known figures among the younger generation.</p>
 <p>“However, from the looks of it, it seems that they plan to delay for time. Moreover, why does Teng Lei not summon his Symbol Puppet?” Lin Dong’s eyebrows suddenly furrowed. He realized that up till now, Teng Lei was only using Mental Energy to fight with Mu Qianqian and had yet to summon his Symbol Puppet.</p>
 <p>“That guy...why does it seem like he’s delaying for something?” Little Marten narrowed its eyes a little and mumbled.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was a little taken aback. Soon after, his gaze suddenly turned towards the area below the Symbol Puppet lair. There, he was faintly able to sense minute undulations.</p>
 <p>“The Ghastly Puppet Cult already has people below refining that high class Symbol Puppet!” When he sensed this tiny undulations, Lin Dong’s expression abruptly changed. It turned out that these guys were purposely delaying the Great Devil Sect while they had practitioners secretly refining the high class Symbol Puppet below!</p>
 <p>“Heh, truly cunning. Let’s go down!” Little Marten let out a strange laughter. They had almost been tricked by the Ghastly Puppet Cult. After all, a high class Symbol Puppet was too important, and even Teng Lei would not feel at ease letting someone else subdue and refine it. Yet, in this situation, it was evident that this guy had still managed to make such an amazing decision.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong nodded his head as his body moved. Borrowing the darkness of the shadows, he noiselessly swept down into the Symbol Puppet lair as his figure swiftly descended.</p>
 <p>As his body quickly descended, Lin Dong saw that there were indeed countless holes along the walls of the huge hole. However, the Symbol Puppets within were already completely without energy undulations, and had clearly already been completely scrapped off.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s eyes vigilantly swept over the landscape below. After descending for several minutes, his eyes suddenly concentrated, only to find a lean elder in a nearby cave below, greedily staring at the Symbol Puppet seated within. Waves of Mental Energy endlessly gushed out from his Niwan Palace, before quickly pouring into the Symbol Puppet’s body, trying to leave behind a Mental Energy brand and gain control over it.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed someone from the Ghastly Puppet Cult!”</p>
 <p>When he sensed the elder’s gloomy Mental Energy, Lin Dong’s gaze flashed, but he did not immediately make a move, and instead swiftly flew into a cave. This elder was a middle stage Soul Symbol Master, and was very powerful, thus even Lin Dong was unable to quickly kill him. Hence, Lin Dong needed to wait for a chance, a certain kill chance!</p>
 <p>If this was an ordinary scenario, a middle stage Soul Symbol Master would definitely not give him this kind of fatal blow chance, however, the situation now was different. For the old guy to create a Mental Energy brand on the Symbol Puppet, he needed to use up an extreme amount of energy. When this kind of consumption reached the peak, his power would instantly drop to an extremely low level, and that was what Lin Dong needed to wait for.</p>
 <p>In the cave nearby, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder had an expression of ecstasy on his face as he gazed at the Symbol Puppet which was gradually emitting light. The Mental Energy he was pouring into the latter was swiftly forming into a Mental Energy brand. When the brand was formed, he would truly be able to control this high class Symbol Puppet. At that time, even within the Ghastly Puppet Cult, his position would immediately rise accordingly!</p>
 <p>When he thought about this scene, the smile on the elder’s face grew increasingly wider. This smile lasted for several minutes, before finally reaching its peak in an instant, because, at this moment, a Mental Energy brand was slowly surfacing on the Symbol Puppet’s forehead...</p>
 <p>“Haha!”</p>
 <p>As he stared at this sight, the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder could not help but raise his head upwards and laugh wildly.</p>
 <p>“Swish!”</p>
 <p>In that instant, an invisible flame swept out from the darkness, like a thunderbolt as it heavily slammed into the former’s chest. Immediately, the frightening burning effect of Mental Energy fire caused the Ghastly Puppet Cult’s Niwan Palace to fall into turmoil.</p>
 <p>“Who?!”</p>
 <p>Mental Energy rebelled, as the Ghastly Puppet Cult elder practically lost control of his body in an instant. As a Symbol Master, he mainly cultivated Mental Energy. Hence, with his strength, the Mental Energy rebellion immediately reached an extremely unbearable stage, such that even stabilizing his body was extremely difficult.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, this old guy’s was rather experienced. Although he lost control of his Mental Energy, his mind immediately nudged with the intention of controlling the high class Symbol Puppet to protect himself.</p>
 <p>However, just as this thought flashed across his mind, he felt a chill at his back. Quickly, a sharp Ancient Halberd pressed against his neck, while a soft chuckle floated from behind him like a ghost.</p>
 <p>“Shall we see which is quicker, you moving the Symbol Puppet or me cutting your throat?”</p>
