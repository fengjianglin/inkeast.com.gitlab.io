Meanwhile, a tinge of joy and excitement, which could not be concealed, surged onto the faces of all the Celestial Demon Marten tribe members present. Their tribe leader had been in a cultivation seclusion for a hundred years. Although there were elders handling the tribe’s matters, they only acknowledged the tribe leader as their true leader.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the kneeling figures, Little Marten stood up straight. He stared at the imposing figure in the sky, before he curled his lips slightly. However, there was joy and relief rising deep within his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten also knew that as of now, he was still unable to shoulder the burden of the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe. This responsibility still had to be carried by his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing in the sky, Hao Jiuyou’s expression changed drastically when he saw that the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader had appeared. However, he quickly concealed his expression, before he knelt down respectfully and greeted the tribe leader. Nevertheless, he involuntarily clenched his fist, which was hidden under his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tribe leader!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, the two elders, who were planning to attack Lin Dong, also had a drastic change in their expressions. In fact, there was a trace of fear in their eyes as they hurriedly knelt down in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That imposing figure standing in front of Lin Dong, calmly surveyed the situation in front of him. After which, he turned his head and looked at the only tall figure standing below. Immediately, a complicated expression flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You unfilial son. So you are still alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Marten glanced at the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. His lazy voice held little respect as he said, “Old man, are you so anxious to attend the funeral of your own child?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Outrageous, how rude!”</span></p>

However, judging by the smile on his face, everyone could tell just how happy he was after he finally saw his own son again, who had been missing for a hundred years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tribe leader, you have finally left your seclusion.” Zhu Li also stood up at this moment. His body moved before he appeared in front of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader. Promptly, joy surfaced on his elderly face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First elder, you have truly let me down this time around.” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader looked at Zhu Li, before he frowned and spoke in a deep voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tribe leader?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhu Li was startled. Clearly, he did not understand why the tribe leader was reprimanding him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Heavenly Cave is an important place to our Celestial Demon Marten tribe. However, the Yimo had planted the ‘Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers’ within, causing all the experts who were undergoing a cultivation seclusion within, including me, to fall into a hallucination. If it is not because young friend Lin Dong snuck in to rescue us, it is likely that our Celestial Demon Marten tribe would have suffered a severe blow!” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe cried out sternly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhu Li’s face turned ashen pale upon hearing this. In fact, every Celestial Demon Marten tribe member below also stood up suddenly, with faces filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They were indeed being set up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold expression flashed across Little Marten’s handsome face. He vaguely guessed that something was amiss in the Heavenly Cave. However, he never expected it to be truly the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tribe leader, is this for real?” Zhu Li was trembling as he asked. Clearly, he had suffered a great shock. If all the top experts undergoing a cultivation seclusion in the Heavenly Cave were wiped out, their Celestial Demon Marten tribe would suffer a massive blow that could potentially lead to their downfall. At that time, they would no longer be considered as one of the four overlord tribes. Therefore, if this incident was true, he would not be able to atone for his sins even if he was to die ten thousand times over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Yimo had indeed secretly planted ‘Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers’ inside the Heavenly Cave. All the powerful individuals, who were undertaking a cultivation seclusion within, had all descended into a hallucination.” Standing beside him, Lin Dong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young brother, may I know who you are?” Zhu Li hurriedly cupped his hands together before he asked in an extremely polite manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, my name is Lin Dong, Little Marten’s sworn older brother. Little Marten is the one who invited me to the Celestial Demon Marten tribe.” Lin Dong smiled before he glanced at Little Marten below. Since Little Marten called him over to deal with such a troublesome matter, he naturally had to take advantage of Little Marten as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Celestial Demon Marten tribe members in the vicinity were stunned as they turned to stare at Little Marten. They were well aware of just how proud Little Marten was. In fact, even the elders in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe could not get him to lower his head. Yet, this human called Lin Dong was actually his sworn older brother?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Standing below, when Little Marten saw the bewildered stares directed at him, the corner of his lips twitched involuntarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This young friend Lin Dong is a pretty decent guy. At least, he is much more reliable than that little fellow.” The tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe said in a faint voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong laughed secretly in his heart. This father and son duo was quite interesting. However, he quickly regained his focus, before he turned somewhat sharp eyes towards the two Celestial Demon Marten tribe elders, who were standing in front of him, as well as Hao Jiuyou, who was at a short distance away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First elder, not only did the Yimo set a trap in the Heavenly Cave, but they have also snuck into your tribe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhu Li’s expression changed drastically. His eyes, which were glowing, suddenly became sharp. A frightening aura suddenly swept out from within his body and enveloped the sky. Everyone could feel that Zhu Li was currently probing for the Yimo hidden amongst them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his probing was clearly completely futile. Hence, he withdrew his aura while wearing a gloomy expression a moment later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First elder, the Yimo have many mysterious techniques and you will not be able to detect their presence by using an ordinary probing.” Lin Dong laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does young brother Lin Dong have a solution?” Zhu Li was also an experienced individual. Promptly, he rotated his eyes and stared at Lin Dong. The latter was merely at the advance Profound Death stage, yet, he was able to rescue the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader, who had fell into a hallucination in the Heavenly Cave. This was not something that an ordinary Profound Death stage brat could accomplish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave this matter to young friend Lin Dong.” The leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe smiled faintly. Subsequently, he took a step forward before his eyes swept across the square. Immediately, the surrounding Yuan Power became a little violent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to find out what Yimo, dares to act so wantonly within my Celestial Demon Marten tribe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong nodded. After which, his eyes loomed towards the two elders of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who were planning to attack him previously. He smiled faintly and said, “Are the both of you going to continue concealing yourselves?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This little brother… The both of us do not know what you are saying?” The two elders’ expressions gently changed. Promptly, their voice was a little hoarse as they said.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong smiled. He clenched his hand before an ancient stone symbol surfaced. A warm white light rose and transformed into a mysterious light symbol. After which, Lin Dong flicked his finger, before the light symbol split apart and turned into two light rays that enveloped those two elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle sizzle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the warm white light shone onto the bodies of those two elders, they immediately circulated their Yuan Power in an attempt to block that light. However, they quickly realized that the white light posed no harm to them. Instead, they were stunned when they saw traces of black Qi seeping out from the surface of their skin whenever the white light shone on them. Moreover, that black Qi was filled with an extremely evil scent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two!”</span></p>

His sharp eyes stared intently at the both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both of your bodies should contain a devil seed, am I right? It is unexpected that members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would actually accept such an evil object.” Lin Dong looked at the two of them, who were currently bewildered, as he said with a faint smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!”</span></p>

Suddenly, the both of them shot forward while evil demonic auras surged from within their bodies. Their auras also began to soar at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two traitors!”</span></p>

Taking a step forward, vast and mighty Yuan Power gathered around him. Not only did his Yuan Power contain a perfectly merged Life Qi and Death Qi, but it also had an additional mysterious ripple. It was the scent of Reincarnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First elder Zhu Li had actually touched Reincarnation. Hence, his strength far exceeded that of an ordinary Samsara stage expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First elder Zhu Li waved his large hand before the sky dimmed. Following which, two large glowing claws descended from the sky and directly enveloped the two elders, who were wrapped with demonic aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang bang!</span></p>

Following which, evil demonic aura transformed into ferocious large pythons that blocked that huge glowing claws. Then, their bodies moved before they rushed ten thousand feet forward. Clearly, their strength had soared with the help of the Yimo Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humph.”</span></p>

He extended his hand and grabbed at the two of them from a great distance away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

After which, the both of them spat out blood due to the frightening pressure from their surroundings. Their auras also became feeble almost instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two ultimate Samsara stage experts were subdued the moment the tribe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe made his move. The strength of a Reincarnation stage expert was truly terrifying.</span></p>

However, I never expected that the both of you would actually commit such a traitorous act!” The Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader’s icy cold voice contained some fury, as it reverberated across the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fury rose in the eyes of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe members below when they saw this scene. As members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, they possessed their own pride that was inherited from the ancient times. Yet, such an embarrassing incident still ended up occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The demonic aura has already invaded their minds when they activated the devil seeds. Hence, their minds have been corrupted. Tribe leader, there is no point in being angry at them.”</span></p>

Devil seeds were extremely well hidden and even he had difficulties locating them. Yet, it was obvious that Lin Dong possessed some special means to do so.</span></p>

After which, his eyes swept across the many members of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who were standing below. Everyone felt a chill over their skin when they saw that pair of eyes looking over.</span></p>

Finally, in front of many startled onlookers, his eyes paused on an indifferent looking Hao Jiuyou.</span></p>

They were startled as they stared at Hao Jiuyou, who was standing in the sky. Could it be that he… was also corrupted by the Yimo?</span></p>
