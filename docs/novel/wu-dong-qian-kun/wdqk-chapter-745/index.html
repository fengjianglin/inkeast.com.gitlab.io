 <p><strong>Chapter 745: Surge in Strength</strong></p>
 <p>The golden light whizzed and spread within the Dantian. That palm sized golden illusory figure appeared to have been formed from within the golden flame. It trembled slightly and extended outwards.</p>
 <p>“Buzz buzz!”</p>
 <p>As that small golden illusory figure slowly grew, those golden lights that had originally shot out suddenly froze at this moment. After which, they ricocheted at a shocking speed before they finally rushed back into the tiny golden illusory figure.</p>
 <p>Chi.</p>
 <p>The latter’s small body vaguely became a little more lifelike the moment that final trace of golden light entered the golden figure.</p>
 <p>At this moment, one could faintly discern the appearance of that illusory golden light figure. Its appearance and features were basically identical to that of Lin Dong. However, that figure was shrunk by many times. From the looks of it, it seemed simple, honest and cute. It looked somewhat different from Lin Dong’s actual self…</p>
 <p>The Yuan Spirit agglomerated. However, it was still quite fictitious. Strictly speaking, Lin Dong’s Yuan Spirit was not fully developed and it was a little lacking compared with the Yuan Spirit that was agglomerated by the experts at the Mysterious Life Stage. However, since Lin Dong was only at six Yuan Nirvana Stage, he still had quite a lot of time to hone and refine his Yuan Spirit. This would be greatly beneficial to him when he advanced into the Mysterious Life Stage in the future.</p>
 <p>After Lin Dong’s Yuan Spirit absorbed all the golden light within his Dantian, he finally began to descend slowly. Soon after, he landed on the Dragon Yuan Ring below. His knees were bent before he sat down. His miniature hands also formed a mysterious training seal at this moment.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>A strange muffled thunder seemed to suddenly resound within Lin Dong’s body the moment the Yuan Spirit training seal had been formed. Waves after waves of galloping torrent like majestic energy suddenly swept out from within the Yuan Spirit. Finally, it coursed along the meridians within Lin Dong’s body.</p>
 <p>These energies coursed through the meridians. At the same time, waves after wave of energy charged directly to Lin Dong’s mind. Finally, it entered into his Niwan Place in an overbearing fashion. Immediately, a monstrous storm was raised within it.</p>
 <p>Buzz buzz!</p>
 <p>Golden light spread over every part of Lin Dong’s body and they wrapped around the small world within his Niwan place. Lin Dong could also clearly sense that the Yuan Power and Mental Energy within his body were soaring in an extremely shocking fashion.</p>
 <p>This was a feedback from the Yuan Spirit!</p>
 <p>The Yuan Dan of the past no longer existed as the Yuan Spirit had replaced it. Clearly, with regards to being a centre for Yuan Power, the Yuan Spirit was undoubtedly a more powerful and evolved version…</p>
 <p>In contrast to the amount of Yuan Power required to activated the Yuan Dan in the past in order to achieve a certain offensive impact, the current Yuan Spirit merely needed half of it. This was the obvious gap between the two.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>Vast and mighty Yuan Power as well as Mental Energy coursed wildly through Lin Dong’s body and his Niwan Palace. In the face of this skyrocketing strength, Lin Dong quickly sensed an invisible barrier that seemed to be blocking him, in an attempt to block his Yuan Power and Mental Energy to continue advancing.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong laughed softly when he sensed that obstruction. After which, a low mutter that was accompanied by some wild heat, suddenly sounded.</p>
 <p>“Breakthrough…”</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The moment Lin Dong muttered within his heart, an extremely wild and violent heated ripple suddenly erupted from within his body. Black Nirvana flames appeared to have surged out from within his flesh. After which, they began a wild and violent rampage.</p>
 <p>The next Nirvana Tribulation had finally arrived once again!</p>
 <p>Wild and violent black Nirvana flames raged fearlessly. The meridians within Lin Dong’s body and his bones once again had some dense green scales appearing on them, blocking the destruction from the flames.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh!”</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Yuan Spirit that was sitting on the Dragon Yuan Ring within his Dantian also slowly opened its tightly shut eyes. Golden light permeated those eyes before a unique pressure spread.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>The Yuan Spirit slowly lifted his small hands before a golden light ray rushed out explosively from his hand. Finally, it swept towards the rising black flames. The black flames seemed to have been pressured when that golden light rushed over as they gradually weakened.</p>
 <p>Having a Yuan Spirit clearly provided an extremely great boost when dealing with the Nirvana Tribulation.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong’s heart suddenly moved when he was facing the Nirvana Tribulation within his body. After which, his seated body on the mountaintop slowly opened his eyes, which had been shut tightly for a long time.</p>
 <p>After both his eyes opened, Lin Dong’s eyes immediately looked at the sky. There were storm clouds gathering at that spot. Silver snakes swam within the dark clouds, emitting a loud rumbling noise.</p>
 <p>“Wind Lightning Tribulation.”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong looked at the gathering storm clouds. However, his eyes did not contain the slightest tinge of shock. It was likely that he was already numb towards experiencing a twin tribulation.</p>
 <p>Dense black light whizzed out from Lin Dong’s head. After which, it directly transformed into an enormous ancient symbol. The symbol rotated, transforming into a black hole that directly rushed towards the storm clouds.</p>
 <p>Rumble!</p>
 <p>The dark cloud immediately churned wildly after the Devouring Ancestral Symbol charged within. A loud and clear thunder roar rumbled and resounded over the place, shaking this mountaintop until it trembled repeatedly. However, not a single thunderbolt fell…</p>
 <p>“This fellow seems to have gained increased mastery over the Devouring Ancestral Symbol …” On the mountaintop, when Little Marten saw this scene, he involuntarily smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Beside Little Marten, was Little Flame, whose figure was just like a metal tower. At this moment, he had also withdrew from his training state. Moreover, it seemed like his aura had been greatly strengthened after this training.</p>
 <p>“It seems like this Wind Lightning Tribulation is unable to pose even the slightest threat for big brother…” Little Flame parted his mouth and smiled.</p>
 <p>Little Marten nodded gently. Being in possession of a divine object like the Devouring Ancestral Symbol and having successfully agglomerated a Yuan Spirit, even a Nirvana Tribulation and Wind Lightning Trial arriving together would no longer pose much problems for Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>This development of the matter was also just like what the Little Marten duo had expected. Following the wild manner in which the Devouring Ancestral Symbol charged into the Wind Lightning Trial, the wild and violent energy contained within the latter also disappeared at a shocking pace. Clearly, it was being devoured by the Devouring Ancestral Symbol...</p>
 <p>Rumble.</p>
 <p>After the final muffled thunder sound appeared, the storm clouds in the sky finally completely scattered. The Devouring Ancestral Symbol rushed back and entered Lin Dong’s Niwan Palace. Soon after, a wave of invisible majestic fluctuation spread apart like a storm with Lin Dong at the middle.</p>
 <p>Lin Dong suddenly opened both of his eyes when the majestic Mental Energy swept apart. After which, he heavily slammed his palm onto the ground in front of him.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The palm fell and an enormous crack line immediately erupted. Within the blink of an eye, it had extended towards the edge of the mountain. Immediately, the mountain began to sway a little.</p>
 <p>Wild and violent Yuan Power and Mental Energy whistled around Lin Dong while golden light flickered from both of his eyes. This continued for quite a while before it gradually scattered.</p>
 <p>“Huff.”</p>
 <p>The glaring golden light disappeared before Lin Dong slowly spat out a mouthful of hot air. After which, he stood up. His body moved and some crackling sound was emitted. A majestic force quietly surged like a shocking thunder.</p>
 <p>Seven Yuan Nirvana Stage. Six seal Heavenly Symbol Master!</p>
 <p>With the agglomeration of his Yuan Spirit, Lin Dong’s strength had undoubtedly soared once again this time around!</p>
 <p>“Not bad…”</p>
 <p>Standing beside him, when Little Marten’s eyes scanned Lin Dong’s body, a tinge of shock flashed across his eyes before he smilingly nodded.</p>
 <p>“Thanks.” Lin Dong grinned at Little Marten.</p>
 <p>“The Earth Core Spiritual Brewing Saliva isn’t of much help to me.”</p>
 <p>Little Marten laughed faintly. Subsequently, his eyes looked towards a certain direction with some surprise. He softly said, “Moreover, compared to you, it is likely that she is even more worrisome…”</p>
 <p>Lin Dong was startled upon hearing these words as he hurriedly turned his head. His pupils shrunk slightly when he saw the young lady seated on a rock. Her ponytail was scattered while her jet-black hair had turned into a somewhat strange icy-blue colour…</p>
