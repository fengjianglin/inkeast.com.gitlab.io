Hence, everyone could only vaguely see a skinny figure within that ice barrier. However, with the passage of time, even an ordinary Dao Sect disciple could detect that an extremely frightening Yuan Power fluctuation was slowly gathering within that ice barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thick layers of clouds rolled in the sky above Dao Sect. Those clouds were all formed from Yuan Power. Meanwhile, the density of the Yuan Power within had reached an extremely frightening stage.</span></p>

Currently, Ying Xuanzi was a top expert who had touched Reincarnation. However, he was ultimately unable to take the final step. This was because not only was his knowledge of Reincarnation lacking, but the density of the Yuan Power within his body had not reached that abnormal level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since his Yuan Power was lacking, he was naturally unable to create Reincarnation Will.</span></p>

He could sense that the Yuan Power gathering in the sky had gradually reached their limits. After all, if the Yuan Power continued to accumulate, it was likely that the entire place would collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

Immediately, countless Dao Sect disciples lifted their heads in shock. Then, they saw that the Yuan Power clouds, that were spread over three hundred miles, were slowly distorting at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strange rays of light penetrated through the clouds and shone downwards. Anyone who was shone by those light rays immediately felt absent-minded. Meanwhile, the Yuan Power within their bodies grew stealthily.</span></p>

Subsequently, he directed his attention towards that mountain peak, which was covered by a layer of ice. Lin Dong had finally taken this step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If he advanced to the Reincarnation stage, he will be qualified to join the ranks of the elite.”</span></p>

Soon after, he frowned gently. Then, he used his palm to touch his chest before a dark expression flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those fellows… they have finally made their move.”</span></p>

In the next moment, a thunderous noise suddenly appeared. After which, everyone was stunned when they saw that the layers of clouds were actually forcefully ripped apart, before a ten thousand feet large Yuan Power torrent suddenly poured downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Yuan Power torrent looked just like a waterfall that hung from the sky, as it descended together with a frightening momentum. Finally, it descended onto the ice barrier in front of countless pairs of stunned eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack.</span></p>

Promptly, she clenched her small hand, before black light spread. However, just as she was about to intervene, an icy cold hand stopped her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is something that one must personally experience in order to break into the Reincarnation stage. No one else should intervene. Otherwise, it will only be detrimental towards him.” Ying Huanhuan said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, Qingtan gently bit her lips. Then, she looked at that mountain peak in a somewhat worried manner. That Yuan Power assault was truly frightening and there was no telling if Lin Dong could withstand it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That ice barrier was shattered. Immediately, countless pairs of eyes turned to look in that direction. Then, they saw that the skinny figure seated on that mountain peak had also stood up at this moment. As he stared at that descending Yuan Power waterfall, there wasn’t the slightest hint of fear on his face. Instead, there was wild heat surging within his dark black eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Buzz.</span></p>

After which, an enormous black hole appeared above his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That Yuan Power waterfall landed, before it charged ruthlessly into that black hole. However, this attack was so terrifying that it even caused that black hole to tremble. Then, Lin Dong suddenly took a step back. In fact, it seemed like his inner organs were displaced after that attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Dong also knew that there was no way he could shrink back at this moment!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black hole began to rotate at an increasingly rapid pace. Meanwhile, the Devouring Power within Lin Dong’s body was unleashed to its limits as it crazily devoured the frightening Yuan Power. Subsequently, it was transmitted into Lin Dong’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As those mighty Yuan Power entered his body, it looked as though there were countless Yuan Power snakes wiggling on his body. It was quite a frightening sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One end of the Yuan Power waterfall was connected to the clouds in the sky, while the other was pouring into the black hole. In fact, it looked like a huge dragon that connected the sky to the ground. It was a spectacular sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was clearly not an easy task to advance to the Reincarnation stage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after the first Yuan Power waterfall descended, the Yuan Power clouds suddenly churned once again. After which, everyone was stunned when they saw ten Yuan Power waterfalls whizzing down from the clouds. They looked just like white dragons, as they bared their claws and charged ferociously towards Lin Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this sight, Ying Xuanzi and the rest’s expressions changed drastically. In fact, Qingtan even clenched her small hand tightly. Meanwhile, standing beside them, Ying Huanhuan’s icy blue eyes were staring intently at that figure on the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huff.</span></p>

Immediately, his pupils shrunk gently. Soon after, a ruthless expression flashed across his eyes. If he could not survive this trial, how could he possibly dream about surpassing the Ancient Masters?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Devouring Ancestral Symbol!”</span></p>

Soon after, an extremely pure black light came whistling from his head. After which, black light gathered rapidly above his head, before they finally transformed into a massive black symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As that symbol slowly wiggled, frightening amounts of Devouring Power erupted. Due to that Devouring Power, everyone was shocked when they realized that the Yuan Power within their bodies were actually showing signs of spluttering forth.</span></p>

Soon after, it swiftly turned into a black human figure, who looked exactly the same as Lin Dong. However, his eyes were just like black holes as they looked extremely deep and mysterious.</span></p>

Then, a terrifying amount of Devouring Power erupted from his mouth. In fact, even the sky itself was devoured until it became distorted. Moreover, the ten Yuan Power waterfalls were also affected by it, as they crazily poured into the mouth of that black figure together with a frightening momentum.</span></p>
