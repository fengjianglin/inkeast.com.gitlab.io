Lin Dong grabbed at the latter as he gritted his teeth and said, “Yan, you asshole!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan dodged Lin Dong’s hand and helplessly said, “You are really as stubborn as a rock. If I don’t say anything, you would never have asked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You meddle far too much!” Lin Dong clenched his teeth together in anger. He attempted to grab Yan a couple of times, but a sheathed longsword suddenly swept in front of him and stopped Lin Dong just as he was about to grab Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu glanced at Lin Dong. After which, she looked at Yan, frowned and asked, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am the Ancestral Stone Spirit. I have always been in this fellow’s body.” Yan’s eyes paused on Ling Qingzhu. His gaze looked straight at her. This was not due to Ling Qingzhu’s appearance. Instead, it was due to the extremely faint but unforgettable ripple from her that only he could detect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, where are you looking?” Lin Dong stepped forward and blocked Yan’s gaze. His expression was unfriendly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter how beautiful a woman is, she would be nothing but a skeleton in my eyes. What are you being jealous for?” Yan glanced at Lin Dong and rudely said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong felt his face flush and glared at Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu was a little amused as she glanced at Lin Dong. After which, she asked Yan, “Why do you know that I have a ripple similar to the Symbol Ancestor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Symbol Ancestor is my first owner. I am naturally extremely familiar with this fluctuation.” Yan smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Ling Qingzhu lightly nod. She tilted her head slightly as her clear eyes stared at Lin Dong and asked, “Do you wish to know why I have such a fluctuation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong hesitated for a moment under Ling Qingzhu’s gaze, which seemed to be able to look straight into his heart. He was ultimately unable to give a direct answer. This caused Yan to be inwardly irritated. This little fellow was usually extremely decisive. Yet, he became extremely hesitant when it came to these two women. Was romance really so troublesome?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Lin Dong did not reply her directly, Ling Qingzhu was extremely intelligent. She slowly retracted her gaze and was quiet for a moment. Finally, she said, “Every palace master and the successor of our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace has practiced a mysterious martial art called the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ since young. This martial art does not have any combat capabilities and cannot be used to battle our enemies. However, it is compulsory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zenith Sensing Art?” Lin Dong and Yan were stunned. They exchanged a glance. It was clear that neither of them had heard of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This martial art is extremely profound. Countless predecessors of our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace have been unable to attain any progress despite using their entire life to study it. However, due to the rules of the palace, we have never given up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moreover, practising this martial art requires one to be pure of mind and body. Hence, the practitioner must… be a virgin. Otherwise, the art will be broken.” An astringent expression flashed across Ling Qingzhu’s eyes when she spoke until this point. Her eyes glanced at Lin Dong, causing the latter’s back to be covered in perspiration. This meant that one time back then had ridiculously destroyed ten years of Ling Qingzhu’s bitter training? No wonder she hated him to the point of wanting to kill him back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But now… you seem to have successfully mastered it?” Yan looked at Ling Qingzhu and asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu nodded slightly and said, “Back then, teacher was exceptionally furious when she learnt that all my hard work was ruined. However, in the subsequent eight years, my proficiency in the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ grew at an increasing rate. Some time ago, teacher used her life and the help of many elders to allow me to successfully master the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’. It was also at that time… that my body gained a trace of the so called fluctuation similar to that of the Symbol Ancestor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This power is indeed very formidable. Although I am only at the Samsara stage, if I was to use this power, it will be difficult even for those Samsara stage experts who have touched Reincarnation to stop me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan nodded. He had saw Ling Qingzhu break open the Devil Feast World, which the Tian Yuanzi had created from their self-destruction, with a slash. Such power might appear inconspicuous, but it was extremely frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan looked at Lin Dong. Seeing that Lin Dong did not react, he involuntarily coughed dryly in his a resentful manner. Where had the usual quick wittedness of this fellow gone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerless feeling swept over Lin Dong after hearing the dry cough. He was naturally aware of what Yan wanted him to do. However… damnit. How could he bring himself to utter those words?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he could only choose to ignore Yan’s reminder. He laughed dryly and said, “It is already quite late. Su Rou and the others are still waiting for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu glanced indifferently at Lin Dong. She had clearly seen the expressions of Lin Dong and Yan. Given her intelligence, she was naturally aware of the thoughts in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I shall take my leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu nodded after seeing that Lin Dong had nothing to say. After which, she turned around decisively. Her graceful figure revealed her tempting curves in front of Lin Dong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are really far too disappointing!” Yan involuntarily scolded when he saw that Ling Qingzhu was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong felt a lot more relaxed in his heart as he watched Ling Qingzhu’s figure. He waved his hand towards Yan and laughed, “Why do you need to be so persistent. There are countless paths in this world. I do not believe that there are no other methods to catch up with the Ice Master. Let’s go. We should also return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was just about to turn around as he spoke. However, he was suddenly stopped by Yan. After which, the latter pointed to their front. Lin Dong raised his head and saw that Ling Qingzhu had stopped. Soon after, she slowly turned around. The sunlight shone on her, emphasizing her enchanting curves. Her long eyelashes moved slightly and the expression in her eyes changed. Finally, she stared at Lin Dong and asked, “Do you wish to learn this ‘Zenith Sensing Art’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong blankly stared at Ling Qingzhu. In the end, he let out a long sigh. If he kept being unreasonable, it would not fit his character at all. He immediately nodded and obediently answered, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu remained where she stood. She gently bit her red lips as she looked at Lin Dong, while her hand gripped her sword scabbard a little harder. There was a struggle in her eyes. This continued for a long time, before she finally sighed softly in her heart as if she had come to a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will you be going outside during this period of time?” Ling Qingzhu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was stunned by these rather strange words. After which, he nodded and said, “I will be heading to the Northern Xuan Region to bring Qingtan back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that case, I will accompany you.” Ling Qingzhu thought for a moment and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Lin Dong was stunned. “Can you really? You are after all the palace master of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many elders in the palace. It doesn’t matter if I leave for some time.” Ling Qingzhu had an indifferent expression. Her clear eyes looked at Lin Dong as she said, “But you must promise me something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not ask me anything related to the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ from now onwards. If I believe that the time is right, I will try and see if I can let you learn it.” Ling Qingzhu said in a faint voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a tightly guarded secret of your Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. Will it…” Lin Dong hesitated for a moment before speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am currently the palace master of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. Moreover, you are a big benefactor of our Nine Heaven Supreme Purity Palace. It is likely that the other elders will not object.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong looked at Ling Qingzhu’s extremely calm expression. Finally, he lightly nodded and said, “Alright, I promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Other than that…” Lin Dong paused. Soon after, he gritted his teeth slightly and said, “Do you know why I want to learn this ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ from you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu’s clear eyes stared at Lin Dong. She softly said, “Everyone has to make their own choices. You have chosen to look for me, and I have chosen to teach you the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I do not need a reason.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will ask Su Rou and the others to go ahead and return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu did not wait for Lin Dong’s reply after she finished speaking. She turned around and left the forest. Lin Dong felt a little stunned as he looked at her figure. In the end, he let out a long sigh. Did she intend to make him feel terribly guilty…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ugh, you are really extremely lucky. It is fortunate that it is you. Otherwise, we can forget about obtaining this ‘Zenith Sensing Art’...” Yan watched from the side as he sighed. The ‘Zenith Sensing Art’ was clearly a tightly guarded secret of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace. Even if someone else had done a great favor for Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, they would definitely not take out something of such importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Ling Qingzhu was extremely intelligent. She had clearly guessed the reason Lin Dong wanted to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’. However, she did not comment about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This girl really likes to silently endure and stubbornly keep everything to herself. This feeling was just like drinking water. Only the person would know if it is hot or cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The most difficult thing to repay in this world is the debt of feelings.” Yan patted Lin Dong’s shoulder and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong was silent. His heart was plagued by complicated emotions. After which, he walked forward and coincidentally saw Ling Qingzhu saying something to Su Rou. The latter held the former’s hand with a bright smile. From Lin Dong’s angle, he could see the tips of Ling Qingzhu’s tender ears turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Lin Dong, we will be leaving senior sister in your care. Please help us take good care of her.” Su Rou waved her small hand towards Lin Dong and said in a lovely voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ling Qingzhu’s sword scabbard knocked onto her forehead with embarrassed anger. This caused some pain to appear on Su Rou’s small face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of young ladies from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace joked around and teased Ling Qingzhu for a while. Finally, their lovely laughter gradually became distant. The clear laughter continued to echo in the mountain forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Qingzhu watched them leave. Only then did she turn around and arrive in front of Lin Dong. She asked, “When do you plan to leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tomorrow. I will return first to notify them.” Lin Dong pondered for a while. Now that there were no problems in Dao Sect, he should hurry and head to the Northern Xuan Region to bring Qingtan back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Ling Qingzhu nodded gently and did not speak any further. Lin Dong turned around after seeing this and the both of them returned to Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They coincidentally met Ying Xiaoxiao after returning to Dao Sect. The latter’s eyes involuntarily became somewhat strange when she saw the both of them. However, she did not comment, and Lin Dong did not explain anything either. He merely asked Ying Xiaoxiao to arrange for Ling Qingzhu’s accommodation, before heading straight to Ying Xuanzi to inform the latter that he had to leave for the time being. Ying Xuanzi was a little surprised, but did not voice any objection. He only instructed Lin Dong to be careful. After all, the world was currently not at peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After which, Lin Dong headed to the back mountain and informed Ying Huanhuan. The latter agreed when she heard that Lin Dong was planning to bring Qingtan back. She was acquainted with Qingtan and the both of them had a relatively good relationship. She wanted to follow Lin Dong but her current condition was unsuitable. Hence, she could only regretfully remain in Dao Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Dong looked at a distant mountain after coming out from the back mountain. He pondered a little, before instruction a disciple to bring two jars of good wine. After which, he carried it to that particular mountain. On the mountain peak, he saw a red haired figure seated on a rock.</span></p>
