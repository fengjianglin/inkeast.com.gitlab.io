 <p>Sky Lightning Island.</p>
 <p>Although the treasure hunt within the lightning cave dwelling dwelling had ended, the Sky Lightning Island region was still quite lively. Several experts had gathered in this location, and none of them showed any signs of leaving after two whole months.</p>
 <p>There was only one reason why they were gathered at this location. All of them were waiting for one person, the one who had obtained the most treasures in the lightning cave dwelling. That person was obviously Lin Dong.</p>
 <p>Even though Mo Luo, an elite expert renowned across the Chaotic Demon Sea, also entered that realm, no one here dared to trouble him. Hence, if they wanted to find out what treasures were hidden within the Thunder World, they would have to pry it out from Lin Dong’s mouth.</p>
 <p>This Sky Lightning Island was a path that one must cross to exit the Sky Lightning Sea Region. Hence, they were guarding this location. Once Lin Dong comes out, it would be nearly impossible for him to escape from their grasp.</p>
 <p>Moreover, on the Sky Lightning Island now, were reinforcements from the Nine Serene Gate and the Mysterious Sky Hall. If Lin Dong showed up, it would be nigh impossible for him to evade capture.</p>
 <p>There was a huge formation spreading in the sky above the Sky Lightning Island. In the middle of the formation, was a light prison. Currently, a green clothed girl with pigtails was trapped within the prison. It was precisely Mu Lingshan.</p>
 <p>Bang bang!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mu Lingshan was furiously swinging her Life Death Coffin Cover and ruthlessly smashing it against the light rays. However, this formation was set up by four initial Profound Death stage experts. Hence, she was unable to escape regardless of how she struggled.</p>
 <p>The four corners of the formation were four individuals, who wore indifferent expressions on their faces as they stared at a struggling Mu Lingshan. Two of them were familiar faces. They were the gray haired old man from the Nine Serene Gate and the middle-aged man from the Mysterious Sky Hall, whom Lin Dong had met before. The other two had cold and indifferent faces as well. The insigma in front of their chest, indicated that they were from the Nine Serene Gate and the Mysterious Sky Hall. They were also at the initial Profound Death stage.</p>
 <p>“It has been two months… yet that fellow has not shown himself. Could he have been killed by Mo Luo?” Standing below the formation, Pang Hao looked at the deepest region of the Sky Lightning Sea Region, with a gloomy expression on his face. His amputated arm had already regrown thanks to the nourishment from his own Profound Life Qi and some medical pills.</p>
 <p>“Mo Luo is overbearing, but he is also a proud individual. It is unlikely that he will kill a younger generation member.” Standing beside him, Liu Xiangxuan shook her head gently and said.</p>
 <p>“Since he had not appeared after such a long time, it can only mean that he had a significant chance encounter within the Thunder World...”</p>
 <p>Rich jealousy and hatred surged within Pang Hao’s eyes after he heard this. He gritted his teeth, “Damned Lin Dong. Damned Mo Luo. The treasures inside the Thunder World should have been ours!”</p>
 <p>Liu Xiangxuan frowned slightly. For some unknown reason, she felt vaguely uneasy. She had originally planned on leaving after everyone exited the lightning cave dwelling. However, the sect ordered her to obtain information regarding the treasure that was located inside the Thunder World. Clearly, an item that Mo Luo held in such high regard was definitely no ordinary item…</p>
 <p>Given Mo Luo’s ability, it was obvious that no one in this Chaotic Demon Sea would dare to question him. Hence, they could only target Lin Dong, who was considered a soft persimmon.</p>
 <p>However, after witnessing how formidable Lin Dong was, Liu Xiangxuan did not think that this so-called soft persimmon was actually a soft one…</p>
 <p>“Let’s wait for another half a month. We will have no choice but to give up if he still doesn’t show up by then.” Liu Xiangxuan softly said. She was aware that there were many experts on this island opposing Lin Dong at this moment. Just their Nine Serene Gate and the Mysterious Sky Hall had a total of four initial Profound Death stage expert. Moreover… those three from the Yuan Gate were also at that level.</p>
 <p>That was equivalent to seven initial Profound Death Stage experts. Given such a lineup, Lin Dong would definitely be unable to escape should he dare to show up.</p>
 <p>“We cannot wait any longer. The sect wants me to head to the Flame Sea Region.” Pang Hao nodded and said.</p>
 <p>“Flame Sea Region…” Liu Xiangxuan’s pretty eyes flashed as she said, “It’s because of the so-called Lightning Competition that the Flame Divine Hall is organising, am I right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Pang Hao’s eyes were searing hot. He greedily said, “The eventual champion will be able to obtain the legendary Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol. That is a truly a divine object. Whoever obtains it will definitely become a top tier practitioner in the future.”</p>
 <p>“The reason why Mo Luo can act in such an overbearing fashion is because he owns the Blazing Ancestral Symbol, am I right?”</p>
 <p>“Champion?” Liu Xiangxuan glanced at Pang Hao indifferently and said, “We are both ranked just below the top thirty individuals on the rookie list. It is not going to an easy task for any of us to become the champion.”</p>
 <p>“It is likely that only the top ten monsters on the rookie list, will have a shot to become the champion. For example, the Flame Fairy from the Flame Divine Hall, Tang Xinlian, the Little Elephant King of the Thousand Elephant Mountain, Zhou Ze, the Dark Demon of the Dark Sea Stream, Teng Kui... “</p>
 <p>Pang Hao’s expression involuntarily turned a little ugly after he heard those well-known individuals in Chaotic Demon Sea. This world did not lack geniuses. Although he was considered as a top ranked younger generation member of Nine Serene Gate, he was merely ranked thirty on the rookie list for the entire Chaotic Demon Sea. Those powerful individuals that Liu Xiangxuan had previously mentioned were all amongst the top ten…</p>
 <p>When faced with those fellows, even the haughty Pang Hao had no choice but to admit that there was quite a big gap between them.</p>
 <p>“Given Lin Dong’s strength, it is likely that he will be able to squeeze into the top twenty rankings on the rookie list. I wonder what are his chances against those ruthless individuals.” Liu Xiangxuan suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you think too highly of that brat. It is not so easy to squeeze into the top twenty rankings on the rookie list. Moreover, even if he had the ability to do so, he must first pass through this checkpoint of death.” Pang Hao spoke in a sinister manner.</p>
 <p>Liu Xiangxuan did not answer, but she silently agreed with him. Indeed, even those top ten powerful experts on the rookie list could only hide, when faced with seven initial Profound Death Stage expert. Even less needed to be said about Lin Dong...</p>
 <p>Three figures were quietly sitting on a mountain a short distance from Liu Xiangxuan and the rest. Their expressions were indifferent and there was an extremely powerful Yuan Power ripple vaguely emitted from them. They were the Huo Yuan trio.</p>
 <p>“A short while earlier, there was a fluctuation being emitted from the little girl’s hand. It is somewhat similar to a message.” The silver haired Li Lei suddenly spoke in a faint voice.</p>
 <p>“It seems like Lin Dong has already left the Thunder World.” Huo Yuan smiled faintly and said. “Given his character, he will definitely come once he knows that this little lass is trapped at the Sky Lightning Island.”</p>
 <p>“This time around, our mission is considered a failure. The fluctuation from that great lord has completely disappeared. It is likely that he has been killed by Mo Luo…” Huo Yuan lowered his eyes and said.</p>
 <p>“That fellow is simply too powerful.” The Li Lei duo shook their heads. They could not hardly resist when facing Mo Luo.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, finishing off Lin Dong can help us to partially atone for our failures. After which, we should also hurry over to the Flame Sea Region.” Huo Yuan said.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Is it the competition that the Flame Divine Hall has organised?” Li Lei was startled as he spoke. “However, given our strength, there is no guarantee that we will win, no? The top ten fellows on the rookie list in the Chaotic Demon Sea are no pushovers.”</p>
 <p>“The sect has informed me that senior Hua will be going as well. Hence, we will most likely emerge as the champions.” Huo Yuan spoke in a calm tone.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Even senior Hua has been dispatched? In that case, we got this in the bag. Hee, the chief once said that if senior Hua was born a century earlier, all the glory reserved for the younger generation members in Eastern Xuan Region, would not be monopolised by Zhou Tong from Dao Sect alone…” The Li Lei duo replied in a startled voice.</p>
 <p>“If I am not mistaken, the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol should be the treasure that Mo Luo obtained from the Thunder World. It is unexpected that the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol was actually hidden in that place…” Huo Yuan smiled and said.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know why Mo Luo is willing to give away the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol, but our Yuan Gate will be happy to take it from him since he has voluntarily done so.”</p>
 <p>“It is only natural for him to spit it out after snatching our things.” Li Lei duo laughed coldly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuan nodded. He was just about to speak when his expression suddenly changed. He suddenly lifted his head as he looked at the deepest part of the Sky Lightning Sea Region. A dark chillness suddenly surged from the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“He is coming.”</p>
 <p>The Li Lei duo rejoiced upon hearing this before they revealed a dense smile. Has he finally came out…</p>
 <p>“Someone has came out from the Sky Lightning Sea Region!”</p>
 <p>After the trio discovered Lin Dong, many exclamations quietly resounded over the lightning island. Subsequently, many figures rose into the air. Their eyes watched the deep parts of the sea region with great excitement.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a green light cut through the sky. It rushed towards the Sky Lightning Island with a shocking speed. Finally, it slowly halted in front of many pairs of eyes. A skinny young man clearly appeared in front of everyone’s vision after the green light scattered.</p>
 <p>“Lin Dong, you have finally shown yourself!”</p>
 <p>Pang Hao’s eyes were vicious as he looked at the young man who had shown himself. Dense murderous intent began to spread.</p>
