 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing and Li Kuanglan moved at extreme speeds, running toward the firearm and food supply crates respectively. As for the other stuff, there was no helping it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After recovering the supplies, they each found a corner to hide from the wind and watch Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were wisps of origin power dancing amidst the raging winds. Like invisible blades, they were so powerful that they could carve out gashes in the rocky ground of the camp. The two ladies had no choice but to activate their origin defenses, otherwise, their clothes and armor would be cut up by the void origin power. There was no way to replace damaged clothes in this accursed place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fierce winds formed a tornado which stretched all the way into the swirling clouds. Flashes of blood-red lightning flickered along the walls of the tornado, almost as though the end-times were near.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the winds didn’t last too long. The tornado scattered after a while, and the swirling clouds gradually dispersed. The spatial lacerations in the sky also faded away unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qianye opened his eyes, there were flashes of sanguine lightning arcing in the depths of his pupils. At this moment, it felt as though his body was full to the brim and leaking with origin power. His newly transformed body was full of violent power, yet it was also itchy, painful, and inexplicably uncomfortable. All he wanted was to smash something to vent this feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a scene of carnage welcomed him as he opened his eyes, and the two girls were hiding far off in the distance, watching him as though he were some kind of monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” Qianye was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s your doing of course! You dismantled our home!” Li Kuanglan wanted to continue blaming Qianye, but Ji Tianqing pulled her back. The latter then asked, “Qianye, were you cultivating just now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye nodded. “The injection activated all the muscles in my body and condensed a new origin vortex. I had to cultivate for a while to replenish my origin power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing asked, “What cultivation art is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This problem cut straight into Qianye’s core secrets, but he neither avoided nor hesitated with his reply. “The Combatant Formula.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, Ji Tianqing wasn’t quite surprised. She pondered for a moment before continuing, “Didn’t you sense anything abnormal just now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye was puzzled. “No, it’s just like before. I sensed the void origin power and then guided it into my body for absorption.” At this point, he thought of something. “If I have to point out something, it’s probably that the area I can sense seems to have grown a bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How big is your usual area of perception?” Ji Tianqing kept up with her questions. Li Kuanglan also seemed quite interested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“About a hundred meters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can sense and control void origin power within that range?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye nodded. “But there’s really too much void origin power around, and I can only absorb so much. Most of it ends up going to waste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an incomparable heartache to ordinary cultivators as they would need fairly good luck to absorb just a small amount of void origin power. Qianye, on the other hand, could converge all the void origin power in the vicinity into a tempest. If people were to hear about this, their jealousy would surely turn to hate, and they might even want to chop him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing, however, was focused on something else entirely. “Qianye, when you’re guiding the void origin power, can you direct it anywhere else apart from your own body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye thought back to the cultivation process before nodding. “I might be able to, but it won’t be accurate. The amount of void origin power is massive, I can only control a small part of it. I probably won’t be able to control more at my current stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The human mind was ultimately limited in capacity. It was impossible to concentrate on too many things unless one cultivated a specific secret art for it. This type of secret art was also extremely difficult to perfect, and only the most important scions of the aristocratic families would have access to it. Song Zining was able to sneak out the Song Clan Ancient Scroll but not the secret inheritance related to concentration. Thus, Qianye knew he was still a ways off from being proficient in this regard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ji Tianqing and Li Kuanglan both looked surprised. The latter disguised her astonishment with a cough, saying, “Qianye, being able to sense and control origin power in the environment is a sign of a divine champion. Although some people are able to pull it off before reaching that level, only divine champions are able to exceed a hundred meters in range. Your performance just now might be lacking in technique, but the power is definitely at the divine champion level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing chimed in, “Many divine champions can stir up a tempest with a single attack, their might spanning over a hundred meters in an instant. In truth, the amount of origin power they can control might not be superior. It’s just that they have special techniques and arts. For instance, some of them can only control one portion of origin power, but that one portion can affect ten, then a hundred meters . That makes their attacks look awe-inspiring, but the truth is that they’re even weaker than you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something lit up in Qianye’s heart after listening to this, almost as though he had achieved a certain enlightenment. The principle was similar to rowing in the water, the initial movement only existed in a small area, but the ripples could spread out far and wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing him in thought, JI Tianqing said, “This kind of secret art isn’t difficult to find. Basically, every family that has ever produced a divine champion will have several of them. I’ll help you find a couple of them after we leave this place. They might not be as good as the Zhao clan’s, but they won’t be so bad, either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye nodded in gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His time in the Zhao clan was short, and he was still far from the divine champion realm back on the void continent. Naturally, the clan wouldn’t hand him divine champion level arts under those circumstances. All major clans had their own rules about when to do what, regulations that couldn’t be messed up. Hence, Qianye still had no idea how to break through to the divine champion realm or what to do afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing said, “Okay, that’s enough. Time is of the essence, so you go and cultivate now. I need to talk to Kuanglan, don’t eavesdrop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding, Qianye gathered his concentration and began refining origin power. The newly formed origin vortex was full of void origin power, which he needed to slowly convert into Venus Dawn. Only then would the vortex become stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was still some time before midnight. Ji Tianqing and Li Kuanglan began organizing what remained of their camp, whispering to one another all the while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the Combatant Formula that powerful?” Li Kuanglan still couldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing replied, “Who knows? Strictly speaking, only three people have ever fully succeeded in cultivating the Combatant Formula: Grand Ancestor, Martial Ancestor, and Martial Monarch. I heard grandpa say that the formula encompasses the might of the heaven and earth, and is one of the most powerful arts in the world. It’s just that only the Grand Ancestor had ever reached perfection. The Martial Ancestor was slightly inferior, and the Martial Monarch even more so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan was astonished. “It’s that awesome?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, grandpa said that the Grand Ancestor is the most talented person throughout our history. He invented countless unimaginable secret arts and single-handedly laid down a thousand years of the empire’s foundation. For some reason, however, no one else managed to cultivate those powerful arts to their peak. Prince Greensun was the most likely to crack the Combatant Formula in the current dynasty, but unfortunately, he gave up at the introductory stage and switched to his own clan’s arts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan pondered for a while. “Judging from the power of Qianye’s cultivation art, he’s very likely reached the introductory realm. Don’t tell me the Combatant Formula requires a vampire bloodline? Besides, the contents of the art don’t look like they can take you very far.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing pointed upward, whispering, “Careful, or those above will hear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who?” Li Kaunglan was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who knows? Those divination bastards just love eavesdropping. If you happen to utter the words they want to hear, you might be unknowingly connected and they’ll figure out what you’re doing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan was shocked out of her wits. She only calmed down after thinking back to the two days prior and recalling that she hadn’t really spoken much during the times she couldn’t be seen. She became sullen after the initial panic. “Which school’s divination arts are so wretched? I’ll destroy them once we get out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not too hard to guess. Just think about it, whose divination arts are powerful enough that they can peep on you, and at the same time understands you enough? Someone who can avoid your sister’s attention and yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This hint was enough to confirm her suspicions. Li Kuanglan’s voice was like shattered ice as she uttered the name word by word, “Song Zining!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You said it, not me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan snorted. “So what if he knows? It makes no difference even if he knows I’m going to teach him a lesson after I leave this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing blinked innocently. “Why not tell your sister? With her skills, I’m sure she can make Song Zining never want to get involved again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s a good idea.” Li Kuanglan was quite straightforward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Tianqing gazed at Li Kuanglan’s abdomen and then whispered in her ear, ”Didn’t your sister tell you about that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan’s cold expression disappeared. Her face flushed red as she reached out to choke Ji Tianqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter, however, had run far away. There was no way she would get caught like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back on the Eastern Sea continent, a large horde of imperial warships was gathering outside of Tidehark, seemingly ready to storm the city. The Evernight army inside the city only consisted of some arachne and vampire forces. In terms of military power, they were only slightly stronger than the forces under Song Zining’s control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining was standing on the deck of his ship, gently flapping his fan as he waited for the airships to finish assembling. There were a couple of airships still on the way. These were actually vessels belonging to the various powers and families of the neutral lands. Having inherited the characteristics of the neutral lands, they were old, rickety, and possessed little to no fighting power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the two sides were equally matched on paper, the best time to engage in a big battle. Song Zining had brought these weak airships along because he wanted to let these native forces witness his might. There was no need for them in battle, anyway. All they needed was to sit quietly and watch from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was feeling happy, Song Zining suddenly felt as though someone had poured a bucket of ice water on his head. An intense chill penetrated his bones and almost froze him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His folding fan fell to the ground with a plop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guards and aristocratic family heads around him crowded over to check up on him. Song Zining, however, was in no mood to maintain his carefree attitude. His face was pale, and his hands were trembling constantly. The only thing he could think of was where this tremendous menace was coming from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even the most talented youngster in divination arts had no clue at all.</span></p>
