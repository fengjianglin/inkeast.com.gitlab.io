 <p>“First, let me assure you with my life’s honor that the Zhang family won’t pursue this matter. Everything will end here.” This was the first term Zhang Xuance was bringing forth.</p>
 <p>Qianye didn’t say anything and merely looked on with a strange smile.</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance’s livid expression went from red to white, white to blue. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, “That… we can also ignore the death of City Lord Luo.”</p>
 <p>Qianye said indifferently, “Zhang Buzhou had a hand in Luo Bingfeng’s death. He should be thanking me instead.”</p>
 <p>“Sire Qianye, you can’t put it that way…”</p>
 <p>Qianye cut him short. “Are there any other terms?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance was shaken. He immediately forgot about the argument he was about to utter and said in a loud voice, “Of course! There’s a lot we can discuss!”</p>
 <p>This time, Zhang Xuance began listing real offers. There was land, rare resources, and even a major mercenary corps. If he hadn’t said it, no one would’ve thought the owner behind the corps was Zhang Buzhou.</p>
 <p>Qianye was rather patient, even when the young man—perhaps from the excitement or forgetfulness—sounded somewhat confused. He spoke when Zhang Xuance finally stopped, “That’s it?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Zhang Xuance’s expression shifted. Was the bounty not enough to sate Qianye’s appetite? Just as he was feeling perturbed, he heard Qianye ask, “Do you think you’re worth that much?” Zhang Xuance choked on the words he was about to say. He couldn’t decide whether he should swallow or spit them out in a sigh.</p>
 <p>As Qianye saw it, the terms suggested were ten times greater than Zhang Xuance’s own worth. The value would only be recouped if he could cross the divine champion threshold one day.</p>
 <p>The young man, on the other hand, thought that Qianye was doubting he would deliver on his promises. “Don’t worry! I can have the things shipped over first, and you can let me go after everything is in order. That way, you won’t have to worry about getting scammed.”</p>
 <p>This fellow was rather considerate. Qianye said after some thought, “It seems I don’t have a good reason to decline.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance sighed. “It’s great that you agree.”</p>
 <p>“When did I say I agree?”</p>
 <p>Qianye’s words slammed Zhang Xuance down from the sky and into the dust. He looked confused as to what expression he should be wearing. After a moment, he stammered, “S-Sire… you…”</p>
 <p>Qianye stretched out a finger. “I only have one condition. If Heavenly Monarch Zhang agrees, then I’ll let you go. If he doesn’t, he’ll have to come and collect your corpse.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance trembled. “What is it? Please tell me.”</p>
 <p>“I want Tidehark.”</p>
 <p>“What!?” Zhang Xuance trembled all over, unable to believe his ears.</p>
 <p>“I want Tidehark,” Qianye repeated.</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance felt a shiver run down his spine, and even his fingers were numb. He finally suppressed his terror and said, “He won’t agree!”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I understand.” Qianye nodded and made no further indication.</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance clenched his teeth. “Sire! Even if he does agree to give you that position, it’s just a name! The Wolf King is just beside Tidehark, do you think you can hold that place? Won’t the city return to the heavenly monarch if he reneges on his words once I’m back at home?”</p>
 <p>Qianye shot him a meaningful glance. “You’re quite thoughtful, aren’t you?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to die yet.” Zhang Xuance was about to cry.</p>
 <p>“Fine, how about this? The things you mentioned just now and the nominal title of Tidehark City Lord. That’s it.”</p>
 <p>“T-This…” Zhang Xuance had no idea what to say.</p>
 <p>The title of Tidehark City Lord sounded impressive, but it was no different from sitting atop a volcano. Not everyone could handle such a position. Only someone like Luo Bingfeng could occupy it with such stability, and no one dared question him. Qianye, on the other hand, might not even require Zhang Buzhou to take action. The backlash from nearby forces was probably enough to remove him from the position.</p>
 <p>For instance, the city lord of Southern Blue had always been Ji Rui even though everyone knew the true master was Qianye. This city lord could only manage his own residence and private properties.</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance felt that just the title alone wouldn’t make much of a difference if there were no armies garrisoned or blood drawn. Naturally, he wouldn’t risk his life to object since Qianye was so intent on it.</p>
 <p>“I need Zhang Buzhou to announce that he recognizes me as the city lord.”</p>
 <p>This condition wasn’t too difficult to accept. Zhang Xuance agreed after some thought.</p>
 <p>Now that both parties had reached an agreement, the young man mentioned an agent in Southern Blue who would be able to bring news to the heavenly monarch’s residence.</p>
 <p>Qianye didn’t find this surprising. Southern Blue had always been a trade city, counting all kinds of people as its residents. Every power would have a few assets here. Even those without ambition would have some people here to gather intelligence and inquire about certain things.</p>
 <p>Qianye allowed Zhang Xuance to withdraw. Naturally, there were people who would bring him along to get things done. There was no need for Qianye to worry about the details.</p>
 <p>After the young man was gone, Qianye stood in front of the window in silence and watched the gloomy skies.</p>
 <p>Three days and three nights passed in this manner.</p>
 <p>Some servants and subordinates came to persuade him during this period, but Qianye simply waved them away and remained standing. He left his spot only when someone came to report the arrival of a representative from the heavenly monarch’s residence.</p>
 <p>Several people were already seated in the parlor, with Zhang Xuance standing on the side. Everyone stood up to greet Qianye as he walked in.</p>
 <p>Qianye shot them a glance. “Did that old master accompanying Zhang Xuance not come?”</p>
 <p>The group from the heavenly monarch’s residence looked rather embarrassed. They glanced at one another before an elder said, “Master Modao’s status is extraordinary. His movements are never known to people like us.”</p>
 <p>Qianye was naturally asking about that divine champion in charge of protecting Zhang Xuance.</p>
 <p>Qianye sat down at the master seat and asked casually, “What is Master Mo’s position?”</p>
 <p>The elder replied, “Master Modao’s surname is Su. He’s a guest elder of the residence and an old friend of the heavenly monarch. Master Modao’s name shouldn’t be mistaken."</p>
 <p>Qianye nodded with a smile.</p>
 <p>Judging from their reactions, Qianye knew that Su Modao’s injuries hadn’t healed just yet. Otherwise, why would he not appear and find a way to reclaim his lost honor? Forced to flee by a young man who wasn’t even a divine champion and even abandoning the heavenly monarch’s favorite grand-nephew, he really had no face left to speak of.</p>
 <p>The Shot of Inception attacked one’s life force. It wasn’t easy to heal after being struck. The Wolf King had only suffered an ordinary attack back then, but he had to use ancestral power to suppress the injury.</p>
 <p>Qianye scanned everyone in the room. “I won’t delay things since you’ve come a long way. Did you bring the items?”</p>
 <p>“Everything is being shipped in. Your esteemed subordinates are checking them at the warehouse.”</p>
 <p>“And that matter about the city lord title…”</p>
 <p>“The heavenly monarch has agreed and sent notices to all the major cities announcing the assignment.”</p>
 <p>“Let me see the notice.”</p>
 <p>Qianye’s attitude could be considered rude, but no one could do anything about it since Zhang Xuance’s life was in his hand. The leader of the group seemed to have come prepared—he immediately produced an envelope and presented it with both hands.</p>
 <p>Qianye went through the contents briefly. The general content was about confirming Qianye as the new city lord of Tidehark after Luo Bingfeng. The literature was concise and contained no other message. Although the writing implied that Qianye was a subordinate of the heavenly monarch, the latter didn’t really mind.</p>
 <p>He placed the letter to the side and glanced at Zhang Xuance. “It seems the heavenly monarch does consider you important. Since the promise has been kept, you’re free to go now.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance didn’t move, however, and glanced anxiously at Qianye. “Sire, about the poison in my body.”</p>
 <p>“I only let her blow some air, you were never poisoned.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance patted his chest in relief. “I knew it, but there’s no way I would dare to gamble.”</p>
 <p>Qianye laughed. This young man was rather interesting.</p>
 <p>Zhang Xuance left hurriedly, but the elder remembered to greet Qianye on his way out. “Sire Qianye, take care.”</p>
 <p>Qianye acted as though he never realized the implication. “I will.”</p>
 <p>After Zhang Xuance’s entourage was gone, Qianye summoned the leaders from the workshops and mercenary corps. He announced that he would be leaving for a while in the near future and instructed them to continue operations as usual.</p>
 <p>Everyone exchanged glances, not expecting Qianye to leave as soon as he had returned. But since Qianye had already returned from the Great Maelstrom, his existence itself was a formless intimidation. There would probably not be a second Zhang Xuance. Besides, it wasn’t easy to devour a large city in the neutral lands without the backing of someone like Zhang Buzhou.</p>
 <p>As for where Qianye was going and what he was doing, no one dared ask about it.</p>
 <p>This was an ample arrangement as far as Qianye was concerned. He left the conference room and flew up from the headquarters with Zhuji, vanishing into the sky.</p>
 <p>All the Dark Flame mercenary leaders sighed in admiration—just that speed of flight was comparable to a divine champion. But they soon realized something was wrong—now that Qianye was gone again, there was no one to oversee Southern Blue.</p>
 <p>Thinking back to when Dark Flame had risen to power, Song Zining had taken control of the entire situation and laid out the entire factory system. With the Ningyuan Heaven Industries at the lead, he had pushed all major companies to invest a large amount of money. On the other hand, Ji Tianqing was everywhere and nowhere at the same time, uprooting the disloyal people early on. This Young Miss Ji looked kind, but most of her opponents had disappeared without a trace. Just thinking about it drenched one in cold sweat.</p>
 <p>As for Qianye…</p>
 <p>He seemed to have done nothing apart from taking on the role of commander.</p>
 <p>His handling of Zhang Xuance was rather clean and tyrannical, but why was he leaving again so soon?</p>
 <p>Thinking about it carefully, it would seem this Qianye wasn’t that good of a leader.</p>
