 <p>Even someone of Zhang Boqian’s ability had to stop when he saw this shadow.</p>
 <p>The shadow drew closer and closer until it gradually took the shape of a giant spider. Just its body alone was bigger than the largest warship. The boundless void was so vast that the world felt like a piece of paper in comparison, yet this shadow’s presence seemed to blot out the skies and cover up the earth. This was a mysterious feeling in the void.</p>
 <p>Compared to the thousand-meter arachnid shadow, Zhang Boqian was as small as a speck of dust. Yet he only seemed serious and cautious, not fearful.</p>
 <p>“This monarch is honored by the Spider Queen’s arrival. You must’ve been waiting for quite a while?”</p>
 <p>It was actually one of the three Supremes of the Sacred Mountain, the Spider Queen! Her leaving the Crystal Kingdom would be an event that would shake the entire Evernight world. Hence, this was likely her clone or projection.</p>
 <p>A female face emerged on the giant shadowy spider. Her appearance was beautiful, but after some thought, one would find that there was no word to describe or praise her—only the breathtaking impression of the moment remained in one’s consciousness.</p>
 <p>What appeared afterward was a black-robe with purple hems. It was studded with platinum and silver emblems, depicting various arachne in different poses. The dress covered her down to the ankles, but strangely enough, one could still sense her perfect curves with great clarity…</p>
 <p>Her cold voice contained a hint of hoarseness, but there was a strange stickiness to it. Hearing her voice filled one with an inexplicable sensation, almost like an itch breaking out from deep inside.</p>
 <p>“I waited for two days.”</p>
 <p>“That’s quite a rare occurrence for someone of your status.”</p>
 <p>“It’s worth it even if I have to wait a couple more days for Prince Greensun.”</p>
 <p>“Wouldn’t you have wasted your time if I never appeared?”</p>
 <p>“If you didn’t appear, then our plan would have succeeded. How is that a waste of time?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian’s gaze turned cold. “But I’m here now!”</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen wasn’t angry, though. With a wave of her hand, a tea table and two mats appeared in the void.</p>
 <p>“I heard you human experts like drinking tea. I happen to have a pot of good tea that was left behind by your Martial Ancestor, aged for several hundred years in the caverns of time. As for the tea set, it was carved from the bones of a void colossus and likely a good fit for someone of your status. Why don’t we sit down and discuss some things over tea?”</p>
 <p>“What do you want to discuss?” Zhang Boqian didn’t act out immediately.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen walked out from the giant spider shadow and sat down before the tea table. Her clothing style should’ve stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the tea set and table, but it didn’t look at all out of place at the moment. Her style was carefree and relaxed, without a hint of pressure belonging to the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>“There are many things we can discuss. No one knows what will happen when the new world opens up. Although the Evernight Council has decided to stop the holy war, the ten-thousand years of enmity between the four major races can only be held back temporarily. How can anyone forget? So, there’s definitely space for cooperation, just like many of your race are already doing.”</p>
 <p>“Who are these people?” Zhang Boqian asked. He had noticed a double meaning in the Spider Queen’s words—one was that the Evernight faction didn’t understand much about this legendary new world, and the other was that they hadn't relaxed after the temporary halt on the holy war. On the contrary, they were even more cautious against one another.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen chuckled. “That I don’t think I can tell you. It’s naturally those smart people who want to be in certain places and take advantage of the situation. Especially the descendants of Lilith and Kane, they think they are the favored children of the darkness. But how come you humans have expanded to your current state in just a thousand years? Maybe after another thousand years, your race will have a seat on the Sacred Mountain!”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about trading pieces?” Zhang Boqian scoffed.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen didn’t understand his reaction. “That word is something we learned from you humans. If Prince Greensun wants to play trade, I’m fine as long as it isn’t from our race.”</p>
 <p>“You’re willing to take such a clear loss?”</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen chuckled. “Why not? The demonkin and vampires have been using my descendants to exchange for favors. They really went too far during the battle at the void continent. They actually touched the foundations of my Crystal Legion. Now that the holy war has stopped, I don’t want to offend Lilith’s group openly. All I can do is look for you people in order to get even with them. Who else can be a better candidate for a deal than Prince Greensun?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian frowned. “What merits do I have?”</p>
 <p>“A lot! For instance, there’s no one you can’t finish off in the void as long as I provide the information. I can also provide you with things you urgently need, that way, you won’t go back on the agreement. Also…”</p>
 <p>“No need to continue, I won’t be working with the dark races.” Zhang Boqian’s reply was decisive and resolute, making no exception just because the one across from him was a supreme of the Sacred Mountain. He didn’t express it, but he was indeed slightly moved. Something he urgently needed? What could that be?”</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen’s appearance had been utterly weird and unlike their race’s usual straightforward methods. If she were seeking outside allies due to the dangerous shift in power balance within their faction, who had managed to persuade her? Who could even incite her?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian’s reply didn’t discourage the Spider Queen. She changed her posture, propping her elbow and chin on raised knees as she said with a smile, “Prince Greensun should think about it. This is something beneficial to your race, so why wouldn’t you do it? Isn’t there a saying in your race that the end justifies the means?”</p>
 <p>“There are some things one should and shouldn’t do. How can I ignore the methods just to get results? If I do that, how will I be any different from those lowlifes?”</p>
 <p>“From your races’ perspective, that can’t be considered vile, can it? Striving for the race’s benefit is a virtuous cause. As for some personal gains that happen along the way, it’s rather understandable.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian replied calmly, “No need to talk about this again, it’s impossible.”</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen replied as though she didn’t know anger, “Fine, let’s talk about the terms then. If Prince Greensun is willing to sit with me and finish this cup of tea, I’ll gift you a demonkin fleet led by a grand duke. I’m sure they won’t be able to escape your grasp as long as I give you their whereabouts.”</p>
 <p>“So generous, huh?”</p>
 <p>“This is just interest for my children. Of course, it’s also fine if you want the vampires, it’s just that they’ve increased the number of active great dark monarchs. What about it, will you think about it? Besides, we’ve already spoken for so long, you only need to sit here a while longer.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian said calmly, “We both know why you’re here and why I’m here. Though, I must admit I never imagined that a supreme would actually take action from afar. I was talking to you all this time in order to recover my origin power and force you to make way. Thank you for the tea, but I like wine more.”</p>
 <p>The smile on the Spider Queen’s face disappeared. “Prince Greensun, must you pass no matter what?”</p>
 <p>“What else?” Zhang Boqian sneered.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen revealed a reluctant expression. “Prince Greensun is powerful, but you’re still too young. Even though I’m just a projection, you have virtually no chance of defeating me in half a day. I must see how you intend on passing!”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian said in a serious tone, “Then don’t blame me for being rude!”</p>
 <p>He stood up and took a step forward, slashing down at the Spider Queen with his palm! A dazzling light lit up at his fingertips as the palm-blade descended, leaving a scorching trail behind. That trail revealed its true form upon extending completely, and it was actually a half-illusory sword made of light.</p>
 <p>A series of whistling sounds echoed in the void as the attack was about to appear. The formless sound waves spread out rapidly, causing the giant spider shadow that was shrouding the area to tremble slightly.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen’s expression froze. Zhang Boqian had attacked with unprecedented momentum from the get-go.</p>
 <p>The heavenly monarch would die if she could block this attack, but the spider projection would be destroyed if she could not. There was no third possibility!</p>
 <p>No, there had to be a third possibility.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen’s expression didn’t change much. Countless thoughts ran through her mind, but in the end, she got up elegantly before the tea table.</p>
 <p>This movement was clearly performed while standing in place, but the entire space seemed to have shifted. There was no longer any obstruction in Zhang Boqian’s path.</p>
 <p>The whistling stopped abruptly as the heavenly monarch retracted his palm blade. The origin power ripples expanding wildly through the void vanished without a trace.</p>
 <p>Even the Spider Queen had to raise her brows at the level of control.</p>
 <p>Just as Zhang Boqian was about to disappear, the Spider Queen said, “Zhang Boqian, are you willing to throw away even your life?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Boqian smiled indifferently without turning back. “Of course not, it’s just that you’re more valuable than I am.”</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen finally revealed an angry smile, but she simply couldn't trade her projection for Zhang Boqian. Now that great changes were imminent, it was the most dangerous time for every race. She couldn’t risk losing any power.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen stood in the void and watched Zhang Boqian travel further away. She sighed softly all of a sudden, washing away all of her visible emotions with it. That beautiful robed figure almost looked like an exquisite doll, devoid of any vital aura.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>In a different part of the void, a high-speed airship was jumping out from the darkness toward a rendezvous point, where a small but impressive fleet was waiting.</p>
 <p>The captain stared momentarily at the terrifying shadow behind the fleet through his binoculars. “Send a signal, seeking permission to approach.”</p>
 <p>Soon after the corvette sent the signal, a bright light flashed back from that unforgettably sleek battlecruiser. That was a signal that the other party could approach.</p>
 <p>The captain glanced doubtfully at the distant Martyr’s Palace. Although there were only three cutting-edge battlecruisers in the Empire, and most captains had never even set foot on one, he was more interested in going aboard the legendary Martyr’s Palace.</p>
 <p>Qianye and his Martyr’s Palace had almost single-handedly turned the battle around outside of the void continent. Just as the Minister of the Right was about to admit defeat, the dragonship had appeared out of nowhere, destroying two duke-grade flagships and forcing back the Evernight reinforcements.</p>
 <p>In the contribution report to the Emperor, the Minister of the Right actually attributed four parts to the vanguard fleet and six parts to Qianye, Song Zining, and Dark Flame. Some generals believed that it wouldn’t be too excessive to credit eight parts of the victory to Qianye, but the Minister of the Right was a veteran politician. He knew that the vanguard fleet had taken severe damage, so it would reflect poorly on the Imperial court if the difference in rewards was too great. A four-six split was a sweet spot where the court wouldn’t dispute the results and the powerhouses of the Imperial Guard wouldn’t lash back.</p>
 <p>Although the official memorandum stated thus, the Imperial Guard soldiers who had taken part in the battle knew what exactly had happened. As veterans, they knew even better how difficult it was to destroy a duke-grade flagship. This was evidenced by how the Imperial fleet had bombarded the two flagships at a slight advantage but still couldn’t destroy them. On the contrary, the enemy had almost turned the tables on them.</p>
 <p>After the battle, the Martyr’s Palace became accepted as the Empire’s number one warship. There were rumors that it might even be more powerful than the Emperor’s flagship.</p>
 <p>That was also the reason why every sailor longed to board the Martyr’s Palace and have a look for themselves.</p>
 <p>But a legendary warship like that wouldn’t just let anyone get on, and the captain was mentally prepared for that. He suppressed the regret in his heart as he lined up with the battlecruiser and passed a sealed box into Song Zining’s hands.</p>
 <p>Song Zining was about to see the captain off after checking that the seal was intact when an attendant said, “Seventh Young Master, I’ll stay behind to help you.”</p>
 <p>Song Zining was startled. The shocked captain roared, “Are you crazy? Who allowed you to speak!?”</p>
 <p>The attendant ignored the captain and made a hand gesture at Song Zining.</p>
 <p>After a momentary daze, Song Zining issued an order to his subordinates. “Bring General Liu inside to rest. The men he has brought must be tired as well, take them all inside to rest. Divide some crew from the corvettes to take over General Liu’s airship.”</p>
 <p>The captain surnamed Liu was shocked out of his wits, but he was dragged away and placed under house arrest, kicking and cursing all the while.</p>
 <p>Song Zining then dismissed his men, leaving only him and that attendant in the room. “We can’t hide the fact that we’ve detained an Imperial warship for very long.”</p>
 <p>The attendant laughed. “Other people might not be able to, but you surely have a way. Besides, the void is so vast and the war is so chaotic. Who knows when the Imperial Guard will find out that one of their warships is missing. The war will be over by that time, so what’s there to worry about?”</p>
 <p>Song Zining stared at the attendant for a good while. He then sighed. “Okay, let’s get down to business. What is the Empress’ command?”</p>
 <p>“The Empress didn’t say anything. She only asked me to go over and watch.”</p>
 <p>“Go over andwatch?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“What were her exact words?”</p>
 <p>“Those are her exact words, nothing else.” The attendant shrugged.</p>
 <p>Song Zining paced about with his hands behind his back, silently digesting the words.</p>
