 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining looked rather serious. “Both Qianye and Kuanglan are highly talented in the martial arts. This child will be a genius in this regard. Why would you need me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your martial prowess isn’t bad, either.” Empress Li glared at Song Zining. “That kid from the Ji family will probably start building a foundation from birth and focus on the martial path in the future. We are hardly the elder prince’s match in this respect. I hope our kid will be smart and not do dumb things like his father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining bowed deeply. “Since you’re placing this important duty on my shoulders, I will do my utmost not to disappoint you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blacksun Valley is still dangerous, you must be careful when you go back there. Be sure to come back alive, I don’t want the qualified teacher I just found to become a dead person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining said seriously, “Rest assured, not many can kill me if I don’t want to die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress Li sighed. “You’re as sly as a fox, not many people can trick you. If only Qianye was half as cunning as you are. Enough about that, time for me to go back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining called out to her, “Empress, Qianye… is he really dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress Li’s face turned pale. Her aura weakened noticeably, and a trickle of blood dripped down the corner of her mouth. “I tried confirming before but the result was the same.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining smiled wryly. “I never underestimated Nighteye, but who would’ve thought she would be so powerful? Who exactly was her past incarnation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That existence is definitely from before the Empire. We have very little information from that era, so we can’t investigate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The era before the Empire appeared to be a strangely slow period of development for the dark races. Their society rarely underwent any changes throughout the millennia. Historical records were mostly incomplete, especially those regarding the major characters. Their stories were more legends than historical facts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when the founding ancestor rose to power and established the Empire did a clear boundary between the two factions become clear. Humans developed a great amount of new technology, which they put to use on the battlefield. And from the battlefield, these inventions eventually found their way to the Evernight faction and triggered a revolution. Countless new inventions began to surface and that, in turn, affected their society as a whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was then that the vampires split into new and conservative factions. The werewolves formed the Summit of Peaks to contend against their ancestral faction. The demonkin warlocks gradually faded away from the battlefield. The arachne, however, didn’t undergo a lot of change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, the intensity of factional wars had weakened throughout the millennium. There were little to no instances where several provinces were rendered uninhabitable after the war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial history books summarized the past era as the dark era. That wasn’t an attempt to smear the other side but simply because the Evernight faction’s past was shrouded behind a curtain of darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Observing the dark races’ history from the Empire’s perspective felt rather strange. Perhaps because those long-lived species didn’t have that great a memory after living so long, there would always be some problem with the stories that had been passed down through word of mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The worst were the vampires; they had actually forgotten the replacement of an entire clan and second-generation primogenitor. This meant that there was little reference about whether the character Nighteye had awakened was from the dark ages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining was no longer in the mood to sleep after Empress Li’s departure. He began going through the battle reports until dawn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone picked him up the next morning and sent him to the airship port for his return to Blacksun Valley. Once in the car, an aide secretly handed him a letter. Song Zining realized what it was after seeing the Profundity Monarch’s insignia on a corner of the envelope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining opened the letter and looked through the contents before destroying it completely. The aide remained silent throughout the entire process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later, the airship took to the sky and flew off into the distance. Song Zining revealed a cold smile as he watched the scenery moving along outside the window. “They really sent their men. Good! Do they really think the world is full of idiots like that Wei Wild Boar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The “generals’ quarters” were made up of a neat row of small buildings, arranged like a barracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place was in the military district. There were few idle personnel as most of the generals qualified to live here had been assigned to the new world and various warzones. There wasn’t so much as a single shadow in the entire street block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A standard military vehicle stopped in front of a small building. There was only the driver and a single passenger on board, the latter clad in the city-garrison uniform and covered in a field cloak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He alighted and entered the courtyard with great familiarity before entering the building. It was as though he were the owner of the house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rooms on the second floor were a tad different from an ordinary barracks. On each side of the corridor were rooms of the same size without any extra decorations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guest entered one of the rooms and removed his cloak—it was actually the Emperor of the Great Qin Empire. There was one other person in the room. Prince Greensun, clad in long, wide-sleeved robes, was boiling tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This small building was assigned to Zhang Boqian when he was just a general. Later on, he was granted the title of Duke Dan and given his own residence in the Imperial Capital. He never transferred his residence in the military district until this day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor sat down in front of Zhang Boqian without bothering with formalities. The latter kept on brewing his tea and finally poured a cup for the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Monarch Zhang, how are your injuries?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing.” With that, Zhang Boqian flicked out a ball of greyish energy and passed it to the Radiant Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor produced a wisp of dark green energy and engulfed the greyish energy with it. After sensing the foreign power for a while, he said, “The laws of the new world are indeed strange.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The greyish energy shrunk by half at this point, yet it gave off a feeling of increased concentration. The Radiant Emperor put away the ball of energy and said, “Did you gain anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said, “It’s the vampires again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected.” The Radiant Emperor summarized the contents of Fang Qingkong’s report and also mentioned the situation at the divination institution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian frowned while listening. "The Demon King?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The movements of the dark supremes were difficult to grasp. Also, the laws in the new world were different, and the environment was complicated. They would be untraceable after a period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian moved on rather quickly. “Are we getting ready for an all-out war?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said, “Yes, we’re also reassigning some heavenly monarchs. I want to switch with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher’s ‘azure bird’ is with me, so mobility won’t be a problem at all. I’ll summon Uncle Riverglance to the capital and have him operate the Emperor Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s brows twitched slightly. He gazed deeply into the Emperor’s eyes, saying, “And?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back when our founding ancestor rose to power at the Luo River, he said: Our Ji family is but the precursor to the daybreak path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said after a moment of silence, “Is the time nigh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a hint of mockery in his expression. “You really are Xitang’s student, both of you like to court death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said, “There are records of a semi-dimensional weapon in the wars of a thousand years ago. The risk will be worth it if I’m fortunate enough to witness it. That’s why, Monarch Zhang, please guard the capital in my stead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly as he observed the Radiant Emperor. “Very well, I’ll agree to the transfer.” He produced two documents that had been folded repeatedly. “What’s with these documents from the military?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor opened them and read the contents, but he didn’t seem too surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said, “There are rumors circulating on the Western Continent. Even if there was any news of Lin Xitang, it shouldn’t originate there, should it? Besides, the news spread like wildfire, encompassing two provinces in two days. If the rebels were that efficient, they would have more than two provinces under their control.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Zhao clan has four dukes and one marshal now, so they have their eyes on the crown prince position again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does that have to do with Lin Xitang? When did he ever interfere with the heir seat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said calmly, “Back when the heir selection issue stirred up the Unending Palace, Teacher sought permission to head to the Western Continent and quell the rebels. The Zhao clan felt that Marshal Lin was there to suppress them. When I later announced that I won’t be picking an heir within ten years, they blamed him for that as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s expression turned dark. “I warned him several times not to meddle in other people’s business!” He suddenly glared at the Emperor. “What happened with Red Scorpion back then? Why did he refuse to see you for half a year afterward?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor remained calm. “That child’s identity had already been exposed back in Yellow Springs. Some believed that Teacher adopted him to deal a blow to the major clans’ designs on the heir position. They produced an incident where signs of collusion with a vampire great duke could be found, an effort to frame Marshal Lin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The major general in charge of the Northern Legion’s paperwork was from the Imperial clan. They used Teacher’s seal and command token to issue the Red Scorpions an order. He only found out when he saw a copy of the case at my place. The operation had already started at that time, and we have no idea what was going on over there. How could I just let him head to the scene? As such, I detained him in the Unending Palace for five days before letting him leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian could already connect the dots. “So you wiped away all public records of the incident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said, “Correct. Barring a testimony from the enemy faction, all evidence had been prepared and was stacked against him. I must praise the Zhao and Li clans in this regard. Both of them have daughters in the palace, yet they’re surprisingly unified when trying to frame Teacher. Fortunately, they had their own agenda in the end and began acting on their own. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to suppress this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I executed that major general without any questioning or trial. I then summoned the Red Scorpion captain and explained the matter to him. All related documents were confiscated, and a gag order was issued to those involved. The man himself was transferred three months later. Of course, the copy of the case files was never returned to them. Some circulating records were the only pieces of evidence left, nothing to be worried about. It was just that the military was split into many different factions, so it was impossible to keep everyone’s mouth shut. Before long, rumors began circulating that the Imperial faction was trying to centralize power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor gave it some thought. He then said with a gentle expression, “Teacher must’ve suspected me from the very beginning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian was assailing the heavenly monarch realm during that time, so he paid little attention to matters outside his warzone. Only now did he realize that all the difficulties Lin Xitang had faced during his time away from the Imperial capital were due to the heir position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder the rumors implied that the clans were rallying behind him to contend with Lin Xitang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly realized something. “You’re summoning Riverglance but still not announcing a crown prince?” Zhang Boqian was a major clan descendant who had been named heir since birth. He couldn’t be bothered with this business, but he was no stranger to the possible outcomes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said, “This so-called Imperial clan is nothing more than a common lord elected by the major clans. Since the nobility can govern themselves, isn’t it best to just let them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian remained silent for a good while before saying, “You should know that Lin Xitang and I have very different views on politics.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor nodded, waiting quietly for the continuation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said, “But I know he wouldn’t do this if he were alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor did not reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian shook his head. “Let it be, this is your family business. It’s fine as long as you and Riverglance are aware.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said, “Uncle Riverglance will arrive at the capital in two days, I will of course talk it out with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian plucked one of the documents from the Emperor’s hand and wrote some words on it. “Do as you wish, Your Majesty. I’ll be taking my leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s figure had vanished before the Radiant Emperor could get up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor sat there for a good while, sipping on the cold tea. Only afterward did he unfold the document to check on its contents. Under the subject of the newly-carved name in the Heavenly Merit Hall, the letters read: if you don’t want the name under a major clan, place it under aristocratic families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor couldn’t help but smile as he put the document away. He then put on his hooded cloak and left quietly just as he had arrived.</span></p>
