 <p>Within the Evernight army, Doer and Digger were standing side by side, watching Bai Aotu’s fearless fight in the distance. These two looked completely unharmed on the surface, but Digger’s aura was inevitably weakened and his arrogance was much more contained.</p> 
 <p>There were followers beside the two dukes, making the entourage look rather miserable. Their most competent subordinates had been sent out to snipe Bai Aotu, yet she was still pushing her way in.</p> 
 <p>Doer remained silent and serious, but Digger sneered, “This woman is beyond dumb. This is far enough for a fake charge, it’ll be too excessive if she keeps up the act. Lord Doer, are you going to keep watching? Why not intercept her and let her know when to give up?”</p> 
 <p>Doer said calmly, “I’m badly injured. It’s already quite a feat for me to be standing here to keep up morale. I might be overreaching myself if I take action. Why don’t…”</p> 
 <p>Without waiting for Doer to finish, Digger said, “I just hope she’ll go back on her own without us needing to intervene.” He hadn’t even finished speaking when he surprisingly noticed that Bai Aotu had killed her way into the central camp.</p> 
 <p>Within Whitetown, Song Zining’s expression was stunned, and Zhao Jundu snorted with an unsightly expression. Qianye, on the other hand, was already charging out with East Peak in tow.</p> 
 <p>At this point, it was obvious that Bai Aotu wasn’t just putting on a show. She was really killing her way through the enemy formation and making for Whitetown. Although her intentions were a mystery, Qianye couldn’t just watch her throw away her life. They needed to help her out.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Jundu picked up his sword and set out in leisurely steps, one step behind Qianye. Song Zining issued a series of commands and injected some stimulant into his arm before leaving the city.</p> 
 <p>The rear lines of the Evernight formation were in chaos, but the frontlines still had their attention on Whitetown. The moment Qianye appeared, everyone’s immediate reaction was to pull the trigger and fire with all their might. It almost seemed as though firing origin bullets didn’t drain their energy.</p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, a screen of bullets appeared before Qianye. His figure flickered at that moment and vanished from the spot, reappearing at the center of the dark race forces. Countless threads of blood appeared, freezing hundreds of warriors around him. It looked as though they had fallen into a dream.</p> 
 <p>Digger's breathing became somewhat heavier. This combination of Spatial Flash and Life Plunder was too powerful, matchless even when fighting against large groups of enemies. Although he had long since heard of Qianye’s indefensible abilities, he couldn’t help but feel shaken upon witnessing them in person.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Jundu, who was behind Qianye naturally dodged his way through the wave of bullets. The fourth young master sped up abruptly after Qianye had cleared away the mob of soldiers. His sword transformed into a stream of azure radiance, weaving through the dark race soldiers and reaping all life in its wake.</p> 
 <p>Whether those in his way were cannon fodder, barons, or viscounts, everyone was dealt with in a single slash. The speed of his assault wasn’t any slower than Qianye’s. In the blink of an eye, he was already deep inside the enemy formation.</p> 
 <p>In front of them, Bai Aotu erupted in a loud roar as she slammed a werewolf count into the ground almost entirely. That count was quite strong as well; he merely spat out some blood and, quite surprisingly, didn’t die. While stepping over the count, Bai Aotu stomped down on his shoulder in passing. Half of the werewolf’s shoulder immediately collapsed.</p> 
 <p>Every move of hers contained great power. It almost looked as though she were charging about violently as she made her way to Zhao Jundu.</p> 
 <p>In a flash of green light, Zhao Jundu killed the two vampire viscounts who were charging after her. He then dragged Bai Aotu by the hand and flew back in the direction of Whitetown.</p> 
 <p>Seeing their prey escaping so narrowly, how could the dark race experts be satisfied? They swarmed over and gave chase despite knowing they wouldn’t be able to catch up. Qianye suddenly appeared in front of them, spinning tens of thousands of sanguine threads!</p> 
 <p>The second Life Plunder immediately cleared the area of ordinary soldiers. Only experts at the viscount rank and above managed to survive, but they too were badly injured and staggering.</p> 
 <p>Qiaye’s face was flushed with an abnormal shade of red, almost as though he were drunk. Even his powerful constitution found it difficult to withstand two Life Plunders in a row. Despite his condition, he still stabbed two viscounts who were closest to him before beating a retreat.</p> 
 <p>His figure vanished abruptly after taking a step back. That wasn’t spatial flash, but rather, Song Zining’s domain concealing him. At the same time, a round of gunfire echoed from Whitetown as a curtain of bullets divided the retreating experts from the enemy.</p> 
 <p>At that point, they finally managed to bring Bai Aotu into the city.</p> 
 <p>Digger’s expression was so gloomy that it was about to drip water. Not to mention Bai Aotu’s penetration affecting the army’s morale, they had also suffered heavy casualties in core titled experts. He was already at a loss about how to explain the situation to his superiors.</p> 
 <p>Digger felt indignant when he saw Doer calm and collected; he couldn’t help but curse repeatedly in secret. No small number of werewolves had died in this fight. How could Doer act as though it had nothing to do with him? Even so, Digger no longer dared to go up against the werewolf duke after learning of his true power.</p> 
 <p>Doer didn’t remain idle during this time. He issued a series of commands, including the formation of an extra defensive line outside of the inner encirclement. The direction of this formation was to the rear, targeting the imperial reinforcements.</p> 
 <p>Digger was startled. “Will the Empire manage to fight their way forward? Wasn’t it said that they’ve been intercepted?”</p> 
 <p>Doer shook his head, saying, “Their main army might not be able to, but a small number of experts can still slip through. We saw one just now, didn’t we?”</p> 
 <p>“Then the Council’s orders…?”</p> 
 <p>“We shall proceed as planned.”</p> 
 <p>Doer’s voice was tranquil, but Digger trembled when he heard it. “Lord Doer, you can hardly suppress your injuries right now. It looks like you won’t be able to contribute much going forward.</p> 
 <p>The werewolf replied calmly, “Lord Digger, the attack you took is much weaker than mine. Besides, I heard there’s someone called Wolf King in the neutral lands who’s a vice-duke as well. He took two or three shots yet was still able to chase after Qianye. You can’t be much weaker than him.”</p> 
 <p>Digger cursed inwardly. “Vampire constitutions are inferior to the werewolves’.”</p> 
 <p>“Is that so? That’s good then.” Ignoring Digger’s awkward expression, Doer turned toward Whitetown. “Let’s give them fifteen more minutes to rest, then continue the assault.”</p> 
 <p>Once inside Whitetown, Bai Aotu’s aura fell sharply and she spat out a mouthful of blood. A well-prepared Zhao Jundu passed her a recovery medicine. She had forcibly activated her origin power to charge into the enemy formation. This placed a significant strain on her and unknowingly inflicted internal injuries. If Qianye, Zhao Jundu, and Song Zining hadn’t arrived on time, she might not have died from exhaustion before she could kill her way out.</p> 
 <p>Bai Aotu stabbed the needle into her arm and soon regained some color. “Thanks.”</p> 
 <p>“To be honest, it’s quite a surprise that you came, but the method isn’t that smart.” This was Zhao Jundu being polite.</p> 
 <p>She replied, “The main army can’t come, but I can. I simply had to let those dark bastards know that they can’t stop us.”</p> 
 <p>“But what you did is useless.” Zhao Jundu shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“I suffered some injuries, but I still have enough strength left for an all-out attack. Even a duke will have to pay a steep price to kill me.” Bai Aotu’s voice was filled with pride and confidence.</p> 
 <p>Zhao Jundu sighed, “This place is clearly a trap, why would you even come?”</p> 
 <p>“You and I have a duel to fight. I’ll have gained a cheap advantage if you died just like that. I’m not about to let people gossip about that. Why don’t we compete who kills more enemies here?”</p> 
 <p>“Very well.”</p> 
 <p>Zhao Jundu had just spoken when a series of shrill whistles echoed through the air. This was the sound of a heavy cannon barrage, and also the signal for the dark races to attack once again.</p> 
 <p>Whitetown was like a lone island amidst a sea of dark race forces, crashing into its walls wave after wave. The city’s resistance was no longer as strong as before. In the blink of an eye, the dark races had charged into the city and continued their meat-grinder-like battle.</p> 
 <p>The number of soldiers on Qianye’s side grew increasingly smaller as one familiar face after the other fell into eternal sleep. The number of enemies around them grew to the point where Qianye could kill a handful of Evernight warriors with a random swing of his sword. At this point, Qianye felt a repeated sense of alarm. This was a sign of being locked onto by an expert. It might be a hidden sniper or an assassin hiding in the rubble, waiting to strike.</p> 
 <p>East Peak was growing heavier and Qianye could feel his body starting to ache. Enemies were also starting to leave injuries on his body. Under the effects of the bloodthirst bugle, the crazed dark race soldiers threw themselves at Qianye. Meanwhile, the experts hiding amongst the ordinary soldiers became a real threat.</p> 
 <p>Even Qianye’s ancient vampire constitution was starting to feel the strain of the enemy’s swarm tactics. If even Qianye was feeling so fatigued, how would Song Zining fare?</p> 
 <p>This thought merely flickered through Qianye’s mind. The three of them were in charge of one area each, but they were also mutually dependent, with each covering the others’ backs. The entire defensive line would collapse if Qianye were to abandon his post. Currently, Bai Aotu was also in Song Zining’s defensive zone, and someone of her ability would surely reduce the pressure on the seventh young master.</p> 
 <p>Qianye suppressed his worries and put his mind back into the killing, especially the enemy titled experts. He didn’t hesitate even if he had to take an injury for it. All he could do at this point was to bleed the Evernight faction as much as he could until they could no longer stand it.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t just Whitetown; fierce battles were raging everywhere on the void continent. The Evernight faction had forcibly landed a large number of troops to stop the three army-routes from advancing toward Whitetown.</p> 
 <p>Duke Wei of the central route was leading the army from the front, his hair disheveled and his eyes bloodshot. He had already stormed the warfront over a dozen times in one day, breaking through nine defense lines in succession. However, the dark races would send more troops every time and build a new defensive line to stop the assault.</p> 
 <p>In the Eastern route, Princess Haimi’s bow-grip and fingers were stained in blood. The quiver on her back was now completely empty as she had fired all her arrows.</p> 
 <p>She glanced around to find that the two armies were locked tight in battle. The Empire would push forward continuously, but the dark races would block their way fearlessly. Things in the air were different—there were eight dark race experts around her, each possessing deep, cryptic auras. It was obvious that these people were of extraordinary strength.</p> 
 <p>Haimi glanced in the direction of Whitetown and saw that the horizon was entirely empty.</p> 
 <p>She retracted her gaze and scanned all the Evernight experts. She then broke into a laugh, saying, “So, I’m the real target huh?”</p> 
 <p>Among the enemy experts, there were demonkin, vampires, werewolves, and arachne. All the major races were here, and clad in uniform outfits too. This clearly wasn’t an alliance that had been formed on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Hearing Haimi’s words, a vampire elder said, “Since Your Highness already knows, please be on your way so that we can return and report back to our master.”</p> 
 <p>“Your master?”</p> 
 <p>“Your Highness knows who it is,” the vampire elder said.</p> 
 <p>Haimi nodded. “So it’s an old friend, and here I was wondering whose strategy could be so far-reaching. But…”</p> 
 <p>“But what?”</p> 
 <p>Haimi pulled out an arrow of light, made purely of origin power. “I admit I underestimated him, but he underestimates me as well. Do you seriously think the likes of you can kill me?”</p>
