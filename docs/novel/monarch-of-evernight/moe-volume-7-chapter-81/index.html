 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These armored soldiers had no valuable spoils on them, not even any personal items. Hence, Qianye didn’t even spare the corpses a glance—he immediately dashed into the nearby rubble and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were flames rising up in every part of Port City, and the sound of gunfire rang out continuously. After the ironclad soldiers had all entered the city, the enemy airships began to deploy soldiers in the tens of thousands below its walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a unit sufficient to decide the outcome of battle in the empire didn’t really bring about a huge effect. In fact, the situation shifted into a deadlock. There was a large number of civilians inside the city, who, after being outfitted with weapons, had turned into qualified soldiers. They had no good way to deal with the armored soldiers, but the ordinary army behind quickly became their targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye roamed the city like a spirit, reaping the lives of armored soldiers wherever he went. With no effective way to defend against Qianye’s abdominal attack in this complicated environment, the steel-clad enemy soldiers perished one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After blasting an armored soldier down, he habitually reached for more ammo, but there was nothing left to grab. Only then did he realize that the fifty bullets the old man had left behind had been used up. This batch of bullets borrowed the characteristics of a gunpowder weapon, using ignition to drive the bullet and origin power to harm the enemy. The good thing about this mechanism was that the drain on one’s origin power was minimal when firing this gun. Even with Qianye’s current origin power, he couldn’t quite fire fifty grade-seven bullets in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye sighed as he placed the scorching hot origin gun into Andruil’s space and went on to search for more armored soldiers with East Peak in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were simply too many armored warriors in the city. Qianye could already sense seven or eight of them within his perception range. He strode forward and crashed through two walls to appear behind an armored soldier. Drawing power to his blade, he chopped off both the creature’s hind legs with a horizontal slash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The armored soldier roared furiously and actually dragged his body around with the two remaining forelimbs in search of its assailant. Qianye shook his head secretly—this kind of enemy was truly difficult to tangle with. Apart from its abdomen, there was almost no weakness, and it would continue to fight no matter where it was wounded. This level of vitality wasn’t normal at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye slashed out once more and cut the warrior through the waist. Only then did it die completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Qianye recalled the armored soldiers he had crushed with his domain a while ago. He appeared beside one of the steel-clad soldiers and spun around it in the blink of an eye, slashing off its legs in the process. The creature’s body fell to the ground and could no longer move no matter how much it roared and hissed. Its blood soon converged into a pool below—apparently, it didn’t have long to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a feasible strategy in hand, Qianye wandered the battlefield like a gust of wind. One after the other, the armored soldiers fell struggling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within moments, dozens of these warriors had fallen in front of Qianye. He had killed at least a hundred of them since the beginning of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye had no intention of stopping here. He followed another armored soldier around the corner and was just about to cut down its legs when a sense of alarm came over his heart. He suddenly rolled toward the opposite side and flashed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an odd-looking young girl standing on the opposite end of the street. She was covered in heavy armor and equipped with force-assistive devices at her joints. She was also carrying a large metallic backpack that would occasionally release clouds of steam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl looked pretty and delicate, but she was carrying a shocking Vulcan cannon in her hand. That strange appearance made it clear that the weapon was a special model. A Vulcan cannon of this size would usually be equipped on airships and used for air-to-ground suppression, sometimes even in air-to-air combat. Now, however, it was being hauled around by this young girl. The multiple barrels started spinning rapidly as she took aim at the steel-clad soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cursing inwardly, Qianye applied a bit of force to push through the wall and ducked into the house. As expected, the Vulcan cannon roared furiously and sent a stream of flames flying through the street, lashing at the armored warrior in a ruthless but impressive fashion. No matter how thick the creature’s skin was, it couldn’t hold out against the barrage of large-caliber bullets. And soon, it was pushed back continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps its limited intelligence didn’t register what retreat meant. It dug in with its four limbs and began charging against the stream of flames. That caused it to suffer the full brunt of the Vulcan cannon’s attacks. The young girl was incomparably accurate—the flames converged into one stream, the entirety of which blasted on the warrior’s armored body. Not a single bullet missed its mark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an entire ten seconds of firing, the steel-clad warrior’s chest plate and helmet were destroyed. At that point, the creature collapsed without even the chance to rage and snarl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Vulcan cannon’s rumble had just stopped when a series of cheers broke out on the other end of the street. Someone cried out, “Number eight! Miss Bluemoon is formidable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another person yelled in Qianye’s direction, “That friend over there, no need to hide anymore! The monster has been killed. Come join us in protecting Miss Bluemoon, let’s go and kill the ninth monster together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, you can’t do anything alone, anyway,” others chimed in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. He had only retracted his aura without concealing himself since the armored warriors possessed a rather poor range of vision. What he hadn’t expected was that someone on the other side happened to see him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But protect that whatever Bluemoon as she kills the armored soldiers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, it hadn’t been very long since the battle began. Being able to kill nine armored soldiers was a fairly shocking speed. But not to mention nine, probably more than a hundred and nine had already fallen to his blade. The city would surely fall if he were to follow this girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye decided to not show his face since these fellows wouldn’t be able to find him anyway. And even if they did, they wouldn’t dare to operate on their own—they would’ve been off searching for armored warriors to kill if they were that courageous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that someone in the group gasped in astonishment. Another steel-armored warrior had appeared and was charging at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon’s expression was unsightly. The Vulcan cannon in her hand was already scalding hot and would likely break down after a hundred more rounds. But there was no way to kill an armored soldier without firing about four hundred rounds. All she could do at this point was rely on the adventurers around her to deter the opponent and stall for time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Bluemoon glancing over at them, the dozen or so people began edging back instead of going forward. No one was willing to wager their lives against this kind of powerful and tenacious opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a beam of green light tore through the skies and struck the nape of the target’s neck. All of a sudden, the steel-clad warrior’s head flew high into the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp, resounding gunshot then rang out from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldier’s headless body swayed somewhat but soon collapsed without flailing about. Everyone was in a daze as they gazed at the corpse of that steel-armored warrior. They had to spend so much effort to finish off one of these creatures, yet this sniper had killed one just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be Su Dingqian taking action? Those with some knowledge knew that it wasn’t possible. But who apart from a divine champion could kill an armored warrior so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the time everyone glanced over to the source of the shot, the marksman was already nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon was also gazing in that direction. She gritted her teeth and muttered, “Dammit! If it wasn’t for this accursed place, I wouldn’t suffer such humiliation.” No one heard her soft voice amidst the noise of the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye was also startled. He then stared at the nape of the dead soldier’s neck and thought to himself, “So that’s the real weakness!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding that, he had also dissected quite a few steel-armored soldiers, but he still couldn’t find where the vitals were. Those organs of theirs were all strange-looking; who knew which of them was the most important? In the end, Qianye had no better way than to attack its abdomen and cut off its legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But with these methods, the soldiers would flail about for a good while before dying. How could he compare to the stunning shot that had finished off the enemy so efficiently?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many things could be seen from the details, but when that shot arrived, even Qianye could only make out the hazy silhouette of a lady. The figure had vanished before he could observe clearly. This kind of sniping ability had far surpassed Eden’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, she was on his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye charged out of the house with his sword raised. He spent some time to sense the distribution of armored warriors around him and made a beeline for one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ramming through three walls, Qianye arrived in a certain street where he found his target as planned. The warrior had just passed by and now had its large butt facing him. However, Qianye didn’t attack immediately and, instead, glanced at the other end of the street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon charged out of the street corner, sliding several meters forward before coming to a sudden halt. Immediately afterward, the Vulcan cannon took aim at the armored warrior and its muzzle began to spin. She had also seen Qianye at this point. Surprised and with a serious expression, she gestured for Qianye to move aside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Qianye yield the prey that was right in front of him? By the time her cannon was ready to fire, Qianye would’ve finished hacking off the target’s limbs and swaggered off. As for whether Bluemoon was willing to attack a crippled target, that was the least of Qianye’s concerns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Origin power surged as East Peak rose high into the air, ready to remove the enemy’s hind legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unexpected change happened at this point as a green light emerged from the corner of his vision! This beam was rather familiar and caused Qianye’s blood core to beat wildly for a brief moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bullet traversed the sky and struck the steel-clad soldier at the back of his neck, sending an armored head flying into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unable to stop the momentum of his slash, Qianye hacked off the warrior’s hind legs. But it was no use—it could be said that the armored soldier was already dead the moment the sniper bullet left its chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye turned toward the source of this shot, but all he could see was an elegant back. She had actually left after firing the shot, not even bothering to confirm the results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her receding figure, Qianye let go of the mild frustration in his heart. He then leapt over the buildings and into the neighboring street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Bluemoon’s Vulcan cannon had just reached its firing speed. In this seemingly short period, the two rivals had acted out a game of prey-stealing right before her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most important problem was that, at first, this prey was hers.</span></p>
