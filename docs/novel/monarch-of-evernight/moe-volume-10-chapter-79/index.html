 <p>With this furious howl, countless consciousnesses awoke inside the forest. In a flash, tens of thousands of perceptions fell upon Qianye’s body and countless more eyes were peering at him from the shadows. Moreover, there was an ancient will slowly waking up in the depths of the forest.</p> 
 <p>These perceptions and gazes weren’t formless. They landed on Qianye’s body like spider webs, and it felt as though he were being weighed down, unable to stretch at will. More and more of these formless spiderwebs stacked atop one another to bring about a sharp rise in resistance.</p> 
 <p>Qianye made an immediate decision to leave. He was thousands of meters away in the blink of an eye, and only then did the sticky feeling leave him.</p> 
 <p>This forest was much larger than the previous one, and there were three of those holy trees the beast race was talking about. Furthermore, judging from the feeling he had gotten just now, that place was likely a beast lair. There was really no telling how many creatures at the level of the six-armed creature were sleeping there. Now that Qianye had woken them up, a baptism of beasts was sure to follow.</p> 
 <p>After heading back to base, Qianye summoned the entire army and reformed their defenses. He also used up all of their blood-gland and beast blood reserves to increase the rate of transformation, bringing in fifty thousand more soldiers into the new-world base. In order to bolster their defenses, Qianye simply moved a mini kinetic tower over and used it to support the ship-cannons that had been removed from the corvettes.</p> 
 <p>In one night, Qianye’s new base was filled with a hundred thousand soldiers and a dozen or so cannon turrets. There were also tens of rapid-firing airship guns throughout the base and the ammunition had been prepared. Qianye and Caroline took charge of command and remained on standby to deal with the six-armed creature.</p> 
 <p>Qianye began to feel a sense of foreboding as the new day arrived. Finally, a tide of darkness appeared over the distant horizon.</p> 
 <p>A beast tide!</p> 
 <p>Alarms blared throughout the base as the soldiers took up positions and waited silently for the enemy horde to arrive.</p> 
 <p>Caroline and Qianye stood side-by-side in the air, gazing at the distant swarm. “So many! There must be a hundred thousand of them!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye said, “Their formation seems a bit chaotic.”</p> 
 <p>“Does that mean something happened to their system?”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know, but either way, it’s a good thing. They’re here, let’s fight!”</p> 
 <p>“Shall we bring Zhuji along?”</p> 
 <p>Qianye hesitated for a while, then shook his head. “Not this fight, we can deal with it.”</p> 
 <p>The rolling beast horde traversed the vast wilderness and finally crashed into Qianye’s defensive line. An all-out battle ensued. The winged beasts and assault types bypassed the defensive line and shot straight into the base.</p> 
 <p>Awaiting them, however, were several high-speed airship cannons and an endless barrage of origin bullets. The high-speed airship cannons spat out a long whip of flames that swung about in the air, sweeping down swathes of beasts. Those that could charge past the suppressive fire had to face the second wave of interception from the origin bullets.</p> 
 <p>The first wave of human soldiers chosen to enter the new world were all elites. Their stamina might not be as good as the werewolves, but their firing skills were leagues ahead. The ample supply of physical origin bullets greatly decreased origin power consumption, allowing each of them to fire several shots in succession. Against this powerful barrage of origin gunfire, both the flying and shuttling beasts began to fall one after the other.</p> 
 <p>Some of them managed to get through the deadly line of fire, only to face thousands of armored werewolves wielding axes. These werewolves were taller than their peers, ferociously strong, and skilled in fighting techniques. The airborne monsters were simply not their match on the ground.</p> 
 <p>On the front lines, groups of smaller high-speed beasts were torn to shreds as they rammed into steel-plated fortifications. Dozens of high-speed cannons fired from the two sides, mowing down the beast horde with streams of flaming metal. The forefront of the battle line was occupied by rows of werewolves equipped with heavy shields and origin handguns.</p> 
 <p>With no way forward or back, the beast tide suffered heavy casualties. Their furious roars turned into painful howls. The warhorse-like creatures at the back were unable to charge the enemy line as they were blocked by the first group, yet they had to suffer damage from the sweeping gunfire.</p> 
 <p>Seeing how things were turning out, Qianye said with a nod, “As expected, something’s wrong with their chain of command. Unlike before, their troop types are not working well with one another.”</p> 
 <p>The two waves of beasts outside the door were perfectly coordinated, attacking relentlessly and giving Qianye great pressure. If it wasn’t for him having the absolute advantage in numbers, he would have never been able to produce such outstanding results.</p> 
 <p>This time, the beast tide was a lot messier, almost ragtag compared to the past assaults. Although there were a hundred thousand of them, the offensive could not stand up to Qianye’s targeted defenses. There was some maneuvering as well with this beast tide, but it was clearly lagging behind. Some listened to the orders, while the others kept on attacking like before, making things even more chaotic.</p> 
 <p>Recalling something, Caroline thought about everything that had happened yesterday. “Could it be a result of you destroying the stone chair?”</p> 
 <p>Qianye said after some thought, “It’s possible.”</p> 
 <p>At this point, the front lines began to quake and tremble as a massive silhouette charged over from a distance. Its mountainous frame stood dozens of meters tall and almost looked like a small mountain shrouded in mist. All those in its way were either flung away or stomped into meat paste.</p> 
 <p>The werewolf chief overseeing the front lines shouted, “It’s a terror beast! terror beast!”</p> 
 <p>This creature's defense was extraordinary, capable of blocking or deflecting all incoming bullets. It seemed nothing could stop its advance.</p> 
 <p>With a snort, Caroline picked up her Thunderous Whip and made ready to take the field. Qianye grabbed her hand and said, “No rush, let’s watch.”</p> 
 <p>The cannon turret at the center of the front line rumbled repeatedly like an ancient war drum. One shell after the other shot out from the cannon and blasted at the terror beast like falling stars. This heavy cannon was the main cannon of a corvette, and its firepower was at a completely different level compared to the rapid-fire cannons.</p> 
 <p>The terror beast began to waver under the constant barrage of cannon shells, crying out constantly due to the pain. It managed to charge forward for a short distance before collapsing with a mournful cry.</p> 
 <p>The main cannon fired ten more times and only came to a stop after confirming that the creature was no longer moving.</p> 
 <p>The fall of the terror beast sent the beast army into chaos. Some of them began to spin around not knowing whether to attack or to retreat. The momentum of the assault weakened drastically, and the beasts fighting on the frontline were soon wiped out due to the lack of reinforcements.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that things had been settled, Qianye turned his gaze toward a small group of creatures in the distance. This squad had not moved since the beginning of the battle. Qianye said with a cold expression, “Found him, the beast commander is there.”</p> 
 <p>Without the need for instructions, Caroline had already shot out with the Thunderous Whip in hand. She flew so quickly that the long whip of lightning trailed behind her. Qianye also arrived above the group in several Spatial Flashes.</p> 
 <p>This was a group of armored horse-like creatures. They looked similar to the ordinary soldiers fighting on the front lines, but they were covered in scales and sported a sharp horn, with mist flowing beneath their hooves. They almost looked like divine creatures at a glance.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Qianye appear out of nowhere, the group of beasts flew up, galloping on thin air as though it were solid ground. They were running away!</p> 
 <p>With a low grunt, the air around Qianye became scorching, and the temperature rapidly shot up. At the same time, a mountainous force bore down upon the beasts and pushed them back to the ground. It would be a joke to try and fly without their own counteracting domain power. Even then, it would be almost impossible to resist the terrifying pressure of Qianye’s domain.</p> 
 <p>Qianye had just pushed the beasts back to the ground when Caroline arrived. The Thunderous Whip swept ferociously at the enemy, filling the entire battlefield with electricity and fire. The beasts were shocked into utter disarray and collapsed in droves despite their strong origin power shields.</p> 
 <p>Qianye was frowning despite the complete victory. His gaze swept over the group of beasts and landed on an unusually strong creature.</p> 
 <p>He dived down from the sky with East Peak aimed at the head of that creature!</p> 
 <p>The beast shot up from the ground and flicked the incoming sword away with its horn. Qianye was diving down with such great momentum, yet his attack was deflected by the creature!</p> 
 <p>Caroline was ready to follow up after Qianye’s attack. Finding an opening, the Thunderous Whip lashed fiercely at the creature’s hind legs. The horse cried out in pain but managed to kick Caroline’s whip away with its hind leg.</p> 
 <p>Caroline was surprised. It was already unbelievable that this all-out lash hadn’t broken the beast’s hind leg. Now, it seemed the creature wasn’t even hurt that badly.</p> 
 <p>Caroline’s distraction served to slow the creature down for half a beat. Before it had realized what was happening, a black feathered flickered before its eyes and vanished into its skull!</p> 
 <p>The beast erupted in a growl, stomping and flailing about in great pain. Caroline raised her whip again and lashed its hind legs once more at the same place. This time, the attack broke one of its hind legs.</p> 
 <p>The beast trembled in pain, with several bulges growing bigger and bigger on its back, almost as though something was about to drill out. Qianye, who had been observing in the air, dived down urgently. He flew past the creature’s back, producing a long cut along the back with East Peak.</p> 
 <p>Without looking back, Qianye turned around and fired another black father into the wound. This Shot of Inception was like a bowl of water in hot oil, immediately eliciting an intense reaction from the target. The creature shot into the sky, then slowly fell back down.</p> 
 <p>“Des… picable…” A familiar voice echoed in Qianye’s mind.</p>
