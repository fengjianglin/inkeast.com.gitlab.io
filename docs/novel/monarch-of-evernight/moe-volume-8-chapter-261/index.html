 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two-armed army split into two groups, one of which traveled along the water—and not so surprisingly ended up joining the procreation party—while the other poured into the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first batch of two-armed natives entering the forest was stung from head to toe. Their skin wasn’t as thick as the six-armed giant, and they did not possess sanguine flames to protect them. They didn’t even have time to scream before they were drained of all blood and fell down as dried corpses. The carcasses fell down into the territory of the ants and rats, where they were devoured until there weren’t even bone fragments left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, thousands of two-armed natives were swallowed up by the forest, but thousands more poured in immediately afterward. The mosquitoes, ants, and snakes poured out in droves, devouring several thousand more. However, there was a sea of two-armed natives outside of the forest, and even more would pour in after the first batch was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tens of thousands of natives pushed into the forest for several hundred meters before dying. This time, there were thousands of skeletons left on the ground—which went to show that the bone-ingesting creatures were full and could no longer take in any more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of two-armed natives charged into the forest amidst loud screams. They smashed through all obstructions with their primitive weapons—be it thorns, beehives, or anthills, nothing was a threat to them anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bees fell dead after excreting too much venom in a short period, and were then stomped into mush. Perhaps due to the hunger, most of the two-armed natives grabbed everything they could and stuffed them into their mouths. Many of them collapsed after eating the ants and insects, but the majority staggered on into the depths of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s heart was filled with leaden clouds as he gazed at the distant scene. He had never imagined that the six-armed giant would use this kind of tactic to shake the forest. No matter how lowly the two-armed natives were in status, this was still tens of thousands of lives being thrown away—and this was just the beginning. How many more of them would have to die in order to fill up this vast forest. Fifty thousand? A hundred thousand?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when the humans established the empire, they were still slaves and food for the dark races. Even then, they had not suffered this type of massacre. The vampires viewed humans as properties, and of considerable value, at that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were actually better, more efficient ways to get through the woods. For instance, setting it on fire was the simplest method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smoke and fire were the best means to deal with insects and ants. Qianye’s sanguine flames could burn the wings of all the bees in each hive. Yet, it would seem the six-armed giant had never thought of this. Be it the two-armed natives or the four-armed warriors, not a single one of them had a torch in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the forest quieted down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As though the two sides had reached a certain agreement, the forest suddenly quieted down. All the insects disappeared without a trace, and the dangerous small animals shrunk back into their lairs. More than a hundred thousand two-armed natives surged into the forest and began roaming about like a pack of hungry wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of four-armed natives marched in from behind the two-armed natives, wielding blades and eyes gleaming with ferocity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye frowned; this wasn’t good news at all. The increase in desire was almost nonexistent in the forest, and neither the two-armed nor four-armed people were affected, allowing them to go all out in the search. The forest might be big, but the two-armed people were even greater in number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a mobilization was just for him? Qianye didn’t feel like he deserved such an honor. Yet, there was no other way to explain why the six-armed giant was hunting him down at all costs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of that aside, the most important thing was to extricate himself from the current danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six-armed giant didn’t try to enter the forest anymore. Apparently, the ancient trees and razor-sharp branches gave him quite a bit of a headache, a pain he was no longer willing to taste again. These ancient trees were extremely sturdy—the six-armed giant might be able to force a path through any other forest, but here, he would need to charge to topple just one tree. And even then, he ran the risk of getting injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vast number of two-armed natives searched the forest, while the four-armed warriors acted as core nodes to lead them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye retracted his aura and climbed down along the tree trunk, stopping when he was a dozen or so meters above the ground. It was at this point that ten two-armed men appeared and began searching through the brambles. Just as they were about to turn around toward him, Qianye flicked a stone at the back of a two-armed native’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This two-armed man roared furiously and, picking up his weapon, looked around in all directions. The surrounding natives glanced at the first man, who pointed in Qianye’s direction. This led countless gazes toward the tree Qianye was in, but the latter was already nowhere to be found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A number of four-armed soldiers arrived at the scene soon afterward. They were clearly much more intelligent and knew to look up at the crown of the giant tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ancient tree was thick and tall, but the foliage wasn’t too exuberant and one could see that the space between the branches was empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tallest among the four-armed giants became furious and kicked that two-armed native to the ground. The latter scrambled a good distance away before continuing his search.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire group passed by below the ancient tree and headed toward the depths of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Qianye was just above them. He had retracted his aura and was sticking close to the tree trunk. Additionally, he was moving around the tree trunk depending on the movement of the two-armed people, making sure to stay out of their sight. After evading this round of investigation, Qianye landed softly on the ground and approached the group from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three two-armed natives were advancing shoulder to shoulder. Just as the two on the left and right flanks were beating the long grass, the person in the middle vanished. The other two never sensed anything, so they simply kept on going.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye dragged the unconscious two-armed native and arrived at a hidden location. He fished out his vampiric knife and pressed it against the man’s neck, and then woke him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neither the two-armed nor the four-armed people were lacking in intelligence. It was just that their cultural development was abnormal and still at the level of a primitive tribe. Even the six-armed giant was more impulsive than intelligent, more like a beast in this regard. Qianye had no hope of getting anything out of the two-armed person, but he had to try.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye knew his own value. He wasn’t worth mobilizing so many forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two-armed man woke up from his sleep and saw a vampiric blade pressed against his neck. This was a common sign for many races and languages, one that didn’t require a lot of intelligence to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this two-armed native reacted rather unexpectedly—his face was full of terror as he opened his mouth and actually emitted a soundless scream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no sound because the frequency had exceeded the range of human hearing, but that didn’t stop Qianye’s perception from picking it up. This scream didn’t spread out very far, only a hundred meters or so, but all the two-arm and four-arm people in the area turned to look in its direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t even the biggest issue. Within the second one-hundred meter perimeter, all of the two-arm and four-arm people turned back at the same time. Their reactions were a tad late, but terrifyingly neat and orderly. Immediately afterward, the natives in the next one-hundred meter ring looked back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this manner, wave after wave of two-arms and four-arms turned around. They spread out toward the periphery like a tidal wave and locked onto Qianye’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh no!” Qianye cried out in secret. He had fought with a good number of two-arms in the high-gravity region. These weaker fellows—greater in number and living under extremely bad conditions—served as cannon fodder and slaves. Naturally, they couldn’t be considered dauntless, but Qianye had never imagined they would risk their lives to issue a warning cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s heart sank after sensing the situation in the forest, realizing that a certain powerhouse had connected these tens of thousands of creatures into one. Once discovered, his location would spread to all the other two-arms and four-arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s hand pressed down, slashing the two-armed native’s throat. The man didn’t die immediately and was still trying to issue another warning with his last gasp. It was just that blood would gush out whenever he tried to open his mouth, stopping him from making another sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rustling footsteps echoed in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye charged out ten meters with a single step and drew blood with a swing of East Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several two-armed natives had just emerged from the shrubbery when their throats were slashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More two-armed people poured out, including several four-armed warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye put away East Peak and switched to an agile movement art. He then weaved through countless natives, leaving small wounds with his vampiric blade. These wounds seemed unassuming, but they were quite possibly lethal or would otherwise handicap the victim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the enemy to camouflage oneself was the way to deal with a vast number of enemies. Qianye was just waiting for the perfect opportunity to go into hiding once more. He only wanted to find a clever way to escape; never once did he think about killing a hundred thousand natives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Qianye was circling behind one of the two-armed people, he felt a rush of wind bearing down upon him. The pressure actually stifled his breathing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He cried out secretly and pushed away the two-armed man he was planning to hide behind. There, he saw a four-armed warrior swinging a large tree trunk down at him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That tree trunk was one meter in diameter and ten meters long, producing an earth-shattering sound when swung. There was no way Qianye could stop such an object, so the only way was to evade. He immediately flashed sideways, sending several two-arms flying and barely escaping the tree trunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This attack, backed by every ounce of the four-armed warrior’s strength, left a huge hole in the ground. Additionally, he had paid no attention to the two-armed people around Qianye, turning over a dozen of the slower ones into meat paste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye sensed a different chill assaulting him, so he jumped up without a single thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An iron spear thrust in like a venomous dragon, piercing Qianye’s previous position. The assailant was yet another four-armed warrior, holding a spear seven meters long. This person didn’t care about the two-arms, either, impaling over ten of them in one spear-strike and turning them into mists of blood.</span></p>
