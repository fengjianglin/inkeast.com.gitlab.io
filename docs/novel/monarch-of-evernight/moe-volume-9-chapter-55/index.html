 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark races’ frenzied attack placed great pressure upon the defending army, evidenced by the rising death toll. Many would become corpses immediately after exiting cover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wave after wave of dark race soldiers crashed into the defensive lines like the tides, slowly pushing it toward the city center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half of Whitetown had been lost in less than half a day, and there was no sign of the dark race attacks stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the deck of his warship, Doer’s sharp gaze pierced through the smoke and mist to land on the battlefield. All of a sudden, the auras of all dark race soldiers in a certain area vanished into thin air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer’s face twitched briefly, the first time he was visibly moved since the battle began. His gaze landed on that area and saw hundreds of werewolf and vampire elites freeze in place, as though they had been cursed, and then collapse one after the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his keen eyesight, Doer naturally realized that the warriors had lost their vitality in an instant. That was why they froze up before collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of power could instantly kill so many elites?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A certain figure appeared amidst the fallen soldiers. As though sensing Doer’s gaze, the man suddenly looked up to meet it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within moments, all Doer could see was a pair of bottomless pupils!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a powerful expert, Doer calmed himself down and the visual phenomenon quickly disappeared. When he looked toward the battlefield again, that person was already gone. The werewolf duke said with a light sigh, “That must be Qianye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no lack of experts near him. Another person who had witnessed the scene replied, “That’s him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer let out a scoff, but no one could tell whether it was born of joy or distress. He turned back and asked, “What are your chances of defeating him if you meet him in battle?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The werewolves exchanged glances, not knowing how to reply. One of the more violent ones cried out, “Are we not going to fight just because we’re not sure about defeating him? Sire, send me into the field. I’ll fight it out with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer looked at him in the eye while shaking his head. “What’s the point? Throwing your life away? Even if that’s what you want, it’s not time yet. Wait a while, and you’ll have a chance to fight with your lives on the line.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The werewolf’s face turned red, but he didn’t dare retort. Keeping it in made him evidently uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already a virtuous count and a member of the upper echelons among the werewolves. Qianye’s cultivation rank wasn’t high, but his fighting power was abnormally high. He himself knew that defeat would come swiftly if Qianye were to fight him in earnest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, all powerful vampire and werewolf experts saw their expressions change. Everyone, including Doer, turned toward Whitetown to observe the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had sensed the auras of titled experts in the city disappearing at an alarming rate. This proved that a true expert had taken action and was starting to reap the core strength of the dark race army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Digger’s expression was unsightly. He snorted heavily, saying, “Insolence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle was mainly led by the werewolves and vampires, so many of the experts in the field were from Digger and Doer’s clans. Suffering grave casualties would affect their clans’ standing in the Evernight world. That was why Digger was so angry. Doer’s expression shifted several times, but in the end, he held back from acting up. “Send all of our reserve forces in!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Digger could no longer hold back. “Are you just giving them free contributions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer said without looking back, “Then feel free to join the battle, Sire Digger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vampire turned livid, but after a while, he said through clenched teeth, “Then we shall do as you say!” With that, he roared at the vampire experts behind him, “What are you looking at? Everything will be settled at the council!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer knew Digger would stir up trouble for him at the Evernight Council, but his expression remained calm as he urged the attack on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Whitetown was covered in smoke and gravel. There was fighting going on everywhere, and one could hardly tell which was the front and rear lines anymore. To the Evernight experts, this was the beginning of their nightmare. Qianye, Zhao Jundu, and Song Zining had entered the field, and these three were like grim reapers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No place on the battlefield was safe from this moment onward. Death could be lingering around everyone at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The core titled experts of the dark race army had no strength to retaliate against the three. They would be killed immediately on sight. Normally when these experts take to the field to lead troops, true experts from the army or at least a vice-duke like Digger should have joined them. Yet the top experts of Evernight were now standing on the flagship, showing no sign that they would take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Doer, a number of experts were starting to feel uneasy. They could almost sense the burning gazes of the frontline soldiers upon them. They should be stepping forward bravely at such a time, yet they remained motionless in the rear. Digger’s breathing became coarse after witnessing Qianye break the neck of a descendant with great potential. To vampires with their powerful life force, such an injury wasn’t enough to cause instant death. However, it was lethal all the same if help didn’t come in time. The descendant fell moaning to the ground, but who would help him on the battlefield?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doer didn’t look at the battlefield, only at the sky above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint rumbling echoed through the air again as armored transport vessels broke through the clouds and made a beeline for the battlefield. These transports braved the bullets and cannon fire to land right beside Whitetown, unloading a large number of heavy-armored soldiers into the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of these transports were riddled with bullet marks. Apparently, they had faced a fierce battle in the void, yet their outstanding performance and armor allowed them to reach the battlefield and still have the strength to fly away. Although some of them exploded during the landing and take-off, they were much better than the normal transports who couldn’t even get near the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The coat of arms on the airships depicted a crossed pair of blood-stained swords. Digger fell silent for a moment, then glanced at Doer with complicated emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soldiers were under the direct command of the Evernight Council. They were actually taking the field. Did Doer have a special connection with the council or were the werewolves planning something big?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was thinking about it, the new soldiers had charged into Whitetown!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These troops were stronger than the first batch and their equipment was far superior to ordinary Evernight elites. They had just arrived in the field when the soldiers of Whitetown started to take greater casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two mercenaries were firing from behind a pile of rubble when, all of a sudden, two blades appeared through their chests! They looked down at their injuries, but just as they were trying to grab the blades, they were flung into the air and thrown toward the intersection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two heavily-armored dark race warriors walked out in large strides. With a sword in their right hands and an origin gun in the left, they arrived before the struggling mercenaries. Just as they were about to finish off the enemy, they saw a young sword-wielding man walking toward them in calm steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the battlefield of blood and fire, this calm young man seemed as though he was walking through his backyard. He arrived before the two heavy-armored soldiers in just one step and waved his sword about just slightly before leaving again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The armored soldiers froze in place. Even their thoughts stopped at that moment as their large bodies crashed down. Up until the moment they lost consciousness, they didn’t know where they were injured or if they were even injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they remembered that young man and recalled his name—Zhao Jundu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a distant tower, Qianye witnessed this entire scene through his scope. He placed the crosshairs on Zhao Jundu’s back for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter sensed it but only waved his hand in response without looking back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smiling, Qianye moved his crosshairs to a vampire knight’s forehead. That vampire’s head burst open the next moment, leaving the headless corpse standing and unwilling to collapse. Qianye’s target had long since shifted to a werewolf baron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a different battlefield, Song Zining was standing on the second floor of a half-collapsed building. A number of Dark Flame officers around him were listening to his orders, preparing to set up a new defensive line. Song Zining’s armor was now covered in blood and mud. Even his hair was half-singed, and there was a gaping wound on the back of his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officers memorized Song Zining’s instructions carefully. This seventh young master’s simple adjustments to the defensive line would usually produce evident results. Many a time, assaults that seemed indefensible would return bruise and battered against these defensive lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining stopped talking halfway through and glanced briefly in Zhao Jundu’s direction. “Is it beginning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seventh Young Master, what’s the matter?” The officers were baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining collected himself and said, “It’s nothing, the battle is about to get even more bitter than he had expected. Get ready to fight with your lives on the line!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tall, burly officer said, “It’s fine to ask us brothers to fight, but where are the reinforcements?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There, don’t you see?” Song Zining pointed at the descending transports.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer was startled. “Aren’t those Evernight transports?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Song Zining was quite calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer realized it after some thought. “Our reinforcements aren’t coming anymore, are they?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining shook his head. “They will come after a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer said urgently, “What’s the use then? By the time they arrive, all our brethren will have turned into corpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Some people will definitely arrive to help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officers sighed in relief, but no one noticed Song Zining’s choice of words, that he wasn’t referring to an army. It was at this time that heavy cannon shells exploded near the small building. The smoke hadn’t even dispersed when a group of armored dark race soldiers rushed out from the street corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The burly officer said in a voice full of killing intent, “We can think about reinforcements later, this daddy is going to slaughter those bastards first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining pulled him back and said while picking up his spear, “I’ll go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer’s expression became solemn. They understood that Song Zining was different from Qianye and Zhao Jundu. If he was finally going to fight personally, it meant that true danger had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only in real combat did the officer realize how terrifying those armored soldiers were. They were familiar with coordinated combat, a rare trait among dark race soldiers, and they were also much stronger than their ordinary counterparts. That was why they posed a serious threat even though their origin power cultivation wasn’t very high.</span></p>
