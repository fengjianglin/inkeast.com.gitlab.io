 <p><strong>Chapter 89: Standpoint&nbsp;<strong>[Volume 2 - Bloom of the Other Shore Flower]</strong></strong></p>
 <p><span>Blood that boiled with energy entered Qianye’s stomach, making the blood energies in his body wake up. They happily rushed toward the immense Darkness origin power, consuming and converting it into their own. Meanwhile, Qianye’s heart began to beat intensely, as if it had been injected with a potent stimulant. The activity within his body immediately skyrocketed by leaps and bounds, continuously converting the vampire warrior’s blood into his own energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Qianye could move again, blood no longer flowed from the wound in the vampire warrior’s corpse. It lay across him, holding him down, so he pushed it away and slowly got to his feet. He surveyed his surroundings. The rooftop was quiet. Yu Renyan had long since disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span>The rest of Darkblood City sat below him. Small commotions continued in areas where the intense combat from earlier had unfolded. Survivors had been inside the buildings that were affected by the fighting. The rest of the streets, however, were unusually quiet. It was as if the destruction that occurred so close to them had never taken place. In these troubled times, all of the citizens of Darkblood City were well aware of an unwritten rule.</span></p>
 <p><span>—As long as the roof hadn’t fallen on their heads, it was best not to poke their heads out of their homes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qianye quietly observed the half-awake city in front of him. He could clearly feel the wounds in his body quickly recovering. The tides of Daybreak origin power inside of him gradually grew stronger as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qianye softly exhaled and leaped from the roof, gently landing on another building around a dozen meters away. Then he slipped into the vast, shadowy night.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ten minutes later, Wei Potian showed up in the streets, radiating a murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dozens of expeditionary army officers followed behind him. Every one of them was at least rank three or above, and their group also had rank four officers accompanying them. However, the only thing that Wei Potian saw the moment he stepped out onto the street was a battlefield in complete disorder. The actual battle had ended a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian’s face was as cold as still water, and his fists were clenched so tightly that his bones cracked. He could never have imagined that the person that suddenly charged out and stopped a large majority of vampires in their tracks was actually Qianye.</span></p>
 <p><span>Back when he sent Qianye a second letter, it was returned to him. An icy-cold obituary followed it. Wei Potian later attempted to use his family’s information network to make some inquiries about what happened, and although that particular battle report was sealed under a grade zero secret archive, he still managed to learn something. For example, he discovered that almost none of the Red Scorpion soldiers left intact corpses, This was the same for Lin Qianye, who had only left behind the core of an identity tag. It was said that Lin Xitang had ultimately taken that tag away.</span></p>
 <p><span>When he recalled the scene in which Qianye shouted for him to escape, Wei Potian felt the blood in his chest boil over.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This bastard…” Wei Potian couldn’t keep himself from swearing.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What did you say, sir?” A major of the expeditionary army asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian suddenly exploded and roared angrily at the major. “What I said just now has nothing to do with you! I want you to search! Search the surrounding area immediately! I want every vampire’s corpse! I want to see that man alive! Do you hear me, you trash!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The major’s face turned green, but Wei Potian didn’t plan to give him any face or any way to leave the spotlight. He continued to raise his voice and roar at every soldier of the expeditionary army present. “What are you pieces of trash doing standing here and waiting? Go find that man for me right now! I’m telling you the truth. If anything happens to him I’ll go find someone to f*cking delete your numbers and then send all of you cowardly, hiding scum to the black mines where you’ll mine until you die! Even if your mothers come begging for mercy, no one will be able to save you! You hear me?!</span></p>
 <p><span>“If any of you don’t like this, come right at me! Your daddy’s name is Wei Potian, and he is totally abusing his power! What can you do about it?!” Wei Potian beat his chest and spat saliva right into the faces of the expeditionary army’s officers.</span></p>
 <p><span>The officers kept quiet and endured the humiliation. No one dared to say a single word. After all, it was their retreat and avoidance of battle that nearly led to Wei Potian, a rookie of the Broken Winged Angels, being surrounded by vampires and almost killed.</span></p>
 <p><span>None of these young masters had common backgrounds, and the boy in front them was Marquis Bowang’s esteemed son! If these youths really had died in Darkblood City, the soldiers of the expeditionary army would definitely be inviting the anger and vengeance of several influential families. Those families would use the Empire’s harsh laws to throw every defender in Darkblood City into a cannon fodder camp before exhausting all of them into battle.</span></p>
 <p><span>No one would stand up and speak up for them throughout that entire process. After all, why would anyone with any actual background come to the Evernight Continent and work as a city defender?</span></p>
 <p><span>When the officers of the expeditionary army scattered and prepared to scour the battlefield, a freezing voice rang out from the sky above them. “Alright, Potian, send them away! Seeing their faces ruins my mood.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia slowly descended from the sky to land next to Wei Potian. When the expeditionary army officers saw Bai Longjia’s Major General insignia, they immediately became frightened out of their wits. After a series of skewed military salutes, they vanished from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, Wei Potian’s anger had yet to subside. He said, “These scumbags knew that dark races were showing up inside the city, yet they refused to leave their camps. When I asked them to send troops, they came up with all sorts of excuses to turn me down even after I showed them the token of the Broken Winged Angels! If I hadn’t told them who I was, those bastards wouldn’t have come with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia indifferently said, “If you want to vent, just take direct action and execute every soldier of the expeditionary army in this camp. If it’s only a thousand lives or so, such a small matter can still be kept under control. You don’t have to sneak up to them while they’re searching the area... that’s way too inefficient.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Eh? There’s no need to execute the whole camp!” Wei Potian jumped in surprise. He knew that General Bai was a ruthless man that took lives like reaping wheat, one that would achieve goals with any bloody method. He really was capable of such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, when he turned around, Wei Potian reluctantly said, “I still really want to kill a few of those bastards! They’re just so damn pathetic!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you’re referring to those people from just now, just take their lives personally,” Bai Longjia said. “This is when you would use your death quota.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian scratched his head and felt a little hesitation in his mind. It was one thing to kill someone on the battlefield, and it was another to just take their lives like this. Although Wei Potian absolutely hated those procrastinating bastards that just refused to send out their troops, he felt as if his hands were tied when it came to just kill them this way. That being said, if any harm came to Little Ye, then he was definitely going to crush them with his own hands!</span></p>
 <p><span>All of a sudden, Bai Longjia began to cough intensely. Two lines of blood trickled from his nostrils.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you okay, General Bai?” Wei Potian hurriedly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia’s battle had already exceeded Wei Potian’s understanding, so he wasn’t sure how Bai Longjia’s strength compared to William’s and the masked arachne’s. He only knew that they were very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span>After Bai Longjia’s coughing fit passed, he took out a handkerchief and wiped the traces of blood from his nose, casually saying, “I’m fine. Those two may be very strong, but they are mistaken about one thing. I am not as weak as they think I am!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian clicked his tongue in secret. This General Bai seemed to be improving everyday. His strength was truly immeasurable. It was no wonder that he was able to become a Major General before the age of thirty.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I heard that someone risked their life to save you. Tell me what happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian, not putting much thought into the situation, immediately told Bai Longjia what happened. This included his conjecture about Qianye’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qianye? Lin Qianye? Hm. He’s still alive?” Bai Longjia still remembered this name. He had personally written an extremely severe comment in his profile back then.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, in his mind, Bai Longjia did not think of that comment as humiliating. Even if Qianye could be considered Lin Xintang’s adopted son, he did not yet qualify to be humiliated by Bai Longjia. The fact that he was willing to personally write a comment on his profile meant that he already saw Qianye in a good light.</span></p>
 <p><span>But the moment Bai Longjia said this, even Wei Potian, with his usually slow wit, noticed that something was wrong. He immediately attempted to correct the mistake and said, “No, it’s possible that I’m just mistaken! That must be the case!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Really?” Bai Longjia simply glanced at Wei Potian indifferently to make him feel as if he had fallen into a house of ice and couldn’t even say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia strolled through the street.</span></p>
 <p><span>His figure appeared at irregular intervals. Sometimes he would stay at the same spot after taking several steps, and sometimes he would appear around a dozen meters away with another step. After watching him for a moment, Wei Potian began to feel dizzy and unfathomably uncomfortable. He staggered suddenly, losing his balance and collapsing to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia chuckled and said, “Who told you to watch my movements? Do you really think you can observe them at your current level? I’m teaching you a small lesson now to let you know that you’ll encounter many similar things in the future. Plenty of individuals among the dark races wield powerful abilities, and some can influence their opponent’s senses to hurt them. You’re still weak, so the best way to deal with this kind of situation is to maintain your Thousand Mountains.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian climbed to his feet, but waves of nausea still lingered as if he were seasick. When he heard Bai Longjia’s advice, he felt a bit awkward as he said, “But Thousand Mountains consumes way too much origin power! Even as I am now, I can only maintain it for five minutes at most. How will that be enough if I’m on the battlefield?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then increase your origin power,” Bai Longjia replied nonchalantly. “That is the true root of our strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia turned eastward, and then he looked to the west. A moment later, he arrived at the spot where Qianye first set up the ambush, the place he had sniped the enemy from. Bai Longjia crouched to the ground and punch some dirt between his fingers. Then stood up again and walked through the alleyway with a few steps, appearing next to the Arm of the Colossus. Bai Longjia turned his head upward and examined it. Then he slowly rose into the air and vanished into the intersecting metal pipes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian rushed over like mad, running all the way from the streets to the Arm of the Colossus, finally managing to find Bai Longjia at the roof of the tower.</span></p>
 <p><span>The corpses of a few vampire warriors lay in front of Bai Longjia. He was looking at his own hand, a few drops of blood staining the fingertips of his platinum glove. Bai Longjia stared at the scarlet bloodstains with icy-cold eyes, an unusually serious expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“General?” Wei Potian suddenly felt a bit cold and couldn’t help but shiver.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was Bai Longjia’s killing intent!</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia turned around and showed the blood on his fingertips to Wei Potian, indifferently saying, “This is Lin Qianye’s blood. I smell blood energy coming from it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qianye? Blood energy? Like a vampire!?” Wei Potian was instantly dumbfounded. He felt as if someone had poured a bucket of freezing water over of his head, the chill piercing through his body from top to bottom. He couldn’t believe it that all of this was real, but this was the only reason that could explain why Qianye hadn’t returned to Red Scorpion or reported in even though he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span>Plenty of people in the Empire fell to the Evernight Continent for all kinds of reasons, and becoming a vampire was a major cause. Just tonight, that high ranking Blood Esquire had attempted to turn Wei Potian into a vampire as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the first wave of shock passed, Wei Potian immediately thought of another matter! It couldn’t have been long since Qianye left. There was no way he would be able to escape Bai Longjia!</span></p>
 <p><span>“General!” Wei Potian immediately roared as he charged in front of Bai Longjia, with his short hair standing on end. However, under Bai Longjia’s icy cold gaze, he wasn’t able to say anything for some time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Among the Broken Winged Angels, Bai Longjia possessed an especially prestigious status. No low-ranking officers dared to oppose him, let alone a rookie like Wei Potian. Although Bai Longjia looked upon Wei Potian rather highly, Wei Potian not enjoy any sort of special treatment. In fact, he went through even harsher training.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What do you want? You better think clearly before saying anything.” Bai Longjia’s tone was as indifferent as before, but Wei Potian could sense the unmistakable feeling of killing intent behind his words!</span></p>
 <p><span>Wei Potian gritted his teeth and cried, “Little Ye saved us! I don’t care what he has become, I only know that he just saved our lives! Even if he was turned into a vampire, he is still fighting against the vampires!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Bai Longjia just stared at Wei Potian.</span></p>
