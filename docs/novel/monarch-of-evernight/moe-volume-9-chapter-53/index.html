 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Considering the cultivation of all those nobles and ministers at the scene, the inner attendant’s voice couldn’t escape their ears no matter how softly he spoke. It was just that the Emperor didn’t try to hide anything, so they wouldn’t go and eavesdrop for no reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor’s expression was calm and composed, almost as though he were listening to an ordinary report. It seemed he understood everything and didn’t ask for a repeat no matter how vague the attendant’s voice was. “Are those things suitable? Did he say he wanted anything else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The attendant’s expression froze, not expecting the Emperor to be so indifferent to the contents of his report. He had come to report Lin Xitang’s movements because he couldn’t deliver the items to the heavenly monarch’s residence. Naturally, he had no answer to this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing no reply, the Emperor responded with an “mm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner attendant was a bit distressed. He bowed even lower and said in a soft voice, “I didn’t deliver it... the documents inside, will it be inappropriate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor said coldly, “What’s wrong with my Imperial Steward reading official documents and battle reports?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner attendant was drenched in cold sweat. The Emperor’s voice was soft and his tone was gentle, but everyone heard it when he said Imperial Steward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The attendant had no idea why the Emperor would open up the matter here, but he began to sweat even more after sensing that something was off. He had always believed that it was an unalterable custom that cabinet documents should not be brought to a heavenly monarch’s residence. Who would’ve thought the Emperor would ask such a question?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, most of the ministers had already guessed that it was Lin Xitang. How could the Emperor have the leisure to listen to miscellaneous news about any other duke while handling official business?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that the monarch’s will was difficult to gauge, and people couldn’t help but think about certain things when the new appointments were announced the day before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The title “Imperial Teacher” made one immune to the death penalty, but at the same time, it removed Lin Xitang of all military authority. Those who took over his territory and title were people from the Zhao clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back in the year, the rebels were running wild on the Western Continent, going so far as to work with the dark races to attack the Zhao. It was Lin Xitang who suppressed them, and because his other territories were all peaceful, he remained on the Western Continent for five years. There was always a bit of friction among lords regarding territorial conferments, so it was only natural that the relationship between Lin Xitang and the Zhao clan wasn’t great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor’s decision to transfer Lin Xitang’s Western Continent territories to the Zhao was a topic people couldn’t help but think about repeatedly. The clan lords and ministers were men of great subtlety. Even when the Radiant Emperor asked that question, they kept on minding their business, either chatting or writing as though they hadn’t heard anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Emperor so indifferently followed up with his second comment: “I feel that there’s no place in this Revelation City where Imperial Steward Lin cannot go. The Laurel Palace worries too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words silenced the entire hall. The Radiant Emperor’s voice was calm and gentle, but the pretense would be too obvious if they kept on pretending not to hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner attendant fell kneeling to the ground, face pale and lips trembling. This entire time, the Radiant Emperor never deviated from his gentle and modest expression. The side-door opened quietly as some people dragged the inner attendant away. The chief steward of Wave Hall entered and stood solemnly to the Emperor’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor spoke softly, “Tell the Empress to manage her affairs well, don’t let just anyone come before me. If they can’t remember the fact that the imperial harem must not participate in politics, they can copy that line for a hundred and eighty times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the steward withdrew, the Radiant Emperor began flipping through the books again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The civil officers who had work to do buried their heads back in their documents, focusing on making their handwriting more intricate and accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nobles, on the other hand, became quite awkward as they could no longer continue chatting in a leisurely manner. The Radiant Emperor had addressed the Empress and Concubine Zhao of the Laurel Palace in succession. It just so happened that people from both the Jingtang Li Clan and Swallowcloud Zhao Clan were here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Marquis Seagaze, Li Tianshi, had it better because the Emperor’s admonishment of Empress Li was moderate and ambiguous. He could stubbornly think of it as his family being dragged into this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, Li Tianshi was rather young compared to all the clan lords who were in their fifties. It didn’t feel as embarrassing for him to be ridiculed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duke Yan, on the other hand, was finding it difficult to keep his composure. With Zhao Weihuang overseeing the Western Continent and Duke You engaged in battle on the void continent, it fell upon him to deal with things here—public matters like the heavenly monarch’s funeral and the conferment of Duke Zhao’s Marshal title.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With three dukes and one marshal, the Swallowcloud Zhao Clan could now stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Greensun Zhang Clan. This was easy to say, but the limelight wasn’t so easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duke Yan felt that the day before was even more tiring than fighting for an entire day. He would’ve never imagined that he would run into such a case in this minor civil-affairs conference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reputation this time was just too unseemly. Meddling in politics and planting men near the Emperor could be ignored for the time being. The major families wouldn’t mock one another openly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what was the point in getting on Lin Xitang’s case? And using such a crude method no less, sending an inner attendant into a hall full of nobles and ministers to report that Lin Xitang had gone to a certain monarch’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wait… a certain monarch’s residence? Which monarch?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This problem echoed in the mind of every noble. Since Concubine Zhao was bringing it up in such a manner, it couldn’t be just any monarch. At the very least, it had to be someone that would anger the Radiant Emperor. That attendant had never dared to “let slip” and the Emperor—intentionally or otherwise—had evaded any mention of it. Now, this was an interesting development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What could this mean? Was the Swallowcloud Zhao Clan eyeing the Empress position now, or were they showing interest in the people at the scene?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing these meaningful gazes, Duke Yan felt the sudden urge to demolish the homes of certain old people on the Western Continent! Back in the year, the dissatisfied Zhao clan had sent a descendant into the palace as a concubine, and now, it was comparable to smashing one’s foot with a stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That lady from the Zhao clan was the daughter of a small branch from Duke You’s lineage. Someone like that simply couldn’t outshine the other noble ladies who had been raised in great refinement. It also happened that this girl trusted a number of elders from the clan, and this wasn’t the first time she had tried to cause trouble for Lin Xitang on their advice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was fine in the past—many from the aristocracy were dissatisfied with Lin Xitang because he held both civil and military power, and liked to promote people of humble origins. Currently, however, Duke Yan wanted to ask those old fogeys who the heck Lin Xitang had provoked for them to attempt this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, it had been proven that the Emperor had been misleading everyone. He wasn’t easy to deal with at all! The Emperor had never bickered with the Imperial harem in the past, but now, he didn’t need to be wary anymore. Regarding whether the Emperor would allow Lin Xitang to hold great authority, it was evident from the title “Imperial Teacher” that he was very willing to support him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duke Yan felt extremely regretful that he hadn’t fully supported Duke You back then, allowing the elders in the clan to arrange the matters regarding the Imperial harem. There was no real need to send someone into the palace just to occupy a position there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhao clan had enjoyed a thousand years of glory, built upon the bravery and sacrifice of its descendants. Marital relationships with the Imperial family were akin to gilding the lily, not the foundation of the clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duke Yan sat as straight as a pine tree, with both hands on his knees. There was nowhere to vent the anger in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian, who had his back toward everyone all this time, turned about and said, “I object to the Highland Song Clan’s no-demotion proposal regarding hereditary titles. Any constant hereditary title is dependent on many factors, like individual strength and personal as well as familial accomplishments, let alone a duke position. If you just want to ensure that the young generation can preserve your family name, they can be re-promoted afterward according to their contributions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After throwing out this heavy cannonball, Zhang Boqian nodded at the Emperor in greeting and left the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This case was being discussed just now with no decided outcome, and Zhang Boqian hadn’t expressed his opinion back then. The conflict between Zhang and Song had been going on for many years, so the family heads didn’t find it strange. But they thought that the proposal had a good chance of passing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was because the current Song clan’s territories had been split up from their core regions, and their guarantor, Prince Rui, had enjoyed good standing all along. This so-called no-demotion was only to last for one generation, so all the other families were happy to do him a favor. Additionally, the nobility felt a bit sorry to see a major clan collapse just like that. Who would’ve thought Zhang Boqian would break his prolonged silence during this awkward moment, then leave after saying his mind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All these clan lords were old foxes who knew quite a lot. Some of them immediately turned to look at Duke Yan. Now that they thought of it, Prince Rui’s maternal family was from the Swallowcloud Zhao Clan, and there were certain branches in the Song who were trying fairly hard to pander to the Zhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Prince Greensun just bashing the Song clan while they were down? Or was the Zhang clan finally going to contest the Zhao clan for the first place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind the pearl curtains, the Emperor suddenly looked up and said, “Since Monarch Zhang has already expressed his opinion, all ministers should proceed to vote on the subject! After all, this is the first time such a matter has been brought up regarding the nobility. It isn’t appropriate for the Imperial clan to make the decision.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan lords froze up for a moment. Even the most astute schemers couldn’t help but find their thoughts evident on their faces. They had never once hoped so badly that His Majesty would just make the decision like a dictator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian paid no heed to what was happening in the Wave Hall. Moments later, he arrived back at the entrance of his residence, but his steps slowed down after entering the door and finally came to a stop in the small plaza in front of the second hall. He stood there for a good while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was there for so long that the shadow at his feet had clearly changed its angle, so long that the steward’s figure could be seen rushing past the corridor to prepare dinner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did Zhang Boqian come to and called out to the steward. The latter bowed respectfully and said, “The Lord Duke arrived in the afternoon and has been resting in the small study in the rear building.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian nodded and made to walk away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The steward asked at this point, “Prince, shall I prepare dinner for the two of you in the side hall?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian halted for a while before saying, “No need, he has other business at night.” With that, he took a step forward and vanished amidst the buildings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian pushed open the carved door of the small study, and as expected, there was no one inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man’s aura wasn’t here. In fact, Zhang Boqian hadn’t sensed his aura since he stepped into the residence. Even if he could use his powerful heavenly monarch’s perception to scan the entire street block, city, or even the wilderness further out, what was the use?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an open scroll on the table, and the used pen hadn’t been washed yet, only propped on the pen stand. The western window was half-open, through which the lush cotton tree outside had pushed one flowering branch into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian walked over to the table and saw a familiar handwriting enter his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unworthy am I, the celebrations have ended, yet we cannot view the cherry-apples together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scroll was pressed down by an oblong piece of jade—its material was simple, and its color was light and pale, almost slightly yellow. A caress over the surface proved that the jade wasn’t a single piece and likely a box that could be opened from the middle. It was actually a “Feather of Fortunate Omens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian had asked Li Xitang for one of these, but it was destroyed soon afterward. Who would’ve thought Lin Xitang would leave him another one?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s expression was calm as he picked up the box. He fiddled around with it for a while before breaking out into a chuckle, “This thing you left me, is it your fate or mine?”</span></p>
