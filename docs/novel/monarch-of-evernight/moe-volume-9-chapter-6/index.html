 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang’s face turned red, then purple, under everyone’s gaze. He heaved and huffed several times before finally suppressing his anger. “Sire Qianye, are you also planning to discuss things standing up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the seated family heads looked away in a different direction, not daring to look straight at Gao Mingtang. Their families were far too inferior. How could they sit calmly when the man was standing by the door. It was just that the torrential pressure from above was so great that even the families usually reliant on the Gao didn’t dare stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s expression was calm. “Since you’re late, then you shall stand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang laughed. “Good, good! I want to ask you one more thing. What will happen to those who don’t arrive at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If they’re not here by sundown, there’s no need to come anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang sneered. He wanted to say “What can you do if they don’t come?” but a sudden notion drenched him in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang said after some deliberation, “They won’t have a seat here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not here, not in this city.” Qianye’s expression was cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang was shaken. “Sire, how will you govern Tidehark without the support of all the families?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A massive entity like Tidehark possessed enough resources and geographical advantage to recover. It was only a matter of time. The complicated web of interests would make it difficult for Qianye to assign them to certain administrative duties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qianye smiled. “Who said I have to govern the city well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, both Gao Mingtang and everyone else in the hall was startled. Their expressions shifted drastically when they realized the meaning behind Qianye’s words. Since he wasn’t considering the effects, it was only natural that he wouldn’t worry about destroying the city. Whichever family Qianye disliked would encounter misfortune. As for whether the city would tumble and fall because of this infighting, that had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rendered the self-importance of these families meaningless, and there was nothing left to threaten Qianye with. Oh, reputation you say? Everyone here was a family-head. Empty words like these would only invite embarrassment in the face of Qianye’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye would naturally gain fame if he could sit firmly in the city lord’s seat. Offering up his foundations in the city against dismantling it, which reputation was the better one? The former would paint him weak, while the latter would give him a fierce name. Everyone knew the answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having thought this through, the clan lords arrived at different moods and expressions. Most of them were contemplative and secretly delighted. Tidehark was big, but it couldn’t fit too many families. The small families would only have space to stand out if the big families were removed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang’s expression shifted several times as he struggled inside. Finally, he glanced out at the color of the sky, then bowed deeply toward Qianye. “It was indeed my fault for missing your appointed time. I have some biological needs right now, may I leave for a bit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go.” Qianye waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang left the city lord’s residence in a hurry, then returned within moments. This journey took just long enough for a toilet run, but everyone knew where he had gone. Why else would he need to leave the manor? There were more than enough toilets here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky outside gradually darkened, and dusk would arrive in less than a quarter-hour. Qianye was seated on his high chair, his eyes closed as though he were asleep. The various clan lords remained as silent and calm as old monks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the last rays of the sun faded away over the horizon, the sound of screeching tires was heard outside of the gates. Two figures jumped over the wall and appeared at the doors of the conference room before the sounds had even faded away. Their steps were quite calm when they entered the chamber, but their act of jumping over the wall betrayed the urgency in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lu Dinghan of the Lu family greets Sire Qianye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun Chuansheng of the Sun family greets Sire Qianye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the clan lords in the hall became restless. The Sun and Lu were among the top five families in the city. Their hurried arrival was very likely due to Gao Mingtang’s report, but it was rather interesting that the biggest Wu and Du families never arrived. No one knew if they had no intention of coming or if they never received Gao Mingtang’s message.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Du family was related to Du Yuan despite living separately, so it was only natural that they wouldn’t come. The Wu family held numerous important positions in the city, boasting a powerful lineup of experts and widespread influence. Their two daughters had been betrothed to Zhang Buzhou’s nephews. This was likely a case of people standing by their relatives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun had set by the time the Sun and Lu families arrived. The lights in the conference room started to light up at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye finally opened his eyes and sat up straight. “Since you’ve come, then stand there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being mentally prepared, the two clan lords were much more composed than Gao Mingtang was. There was no anger on their faces as they greeted Gao Mingtang and took their places beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye ordered, “It’s about time. Close the doors and refuse all visitors henceforth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guards left to issue the order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The original gates and its tower had been demolished by Qianye, but the city lord manor was designed like a small fortress with two thresholds just like the city gates. The reserve layer was made up of alloy doors that were one meter thick, normally hidden inside the walls. Now, they looked rather miserable behind the cracked bricks. The tracks and mechanisms were still intact because Qianye reflected upon his actions and realized that he shouldn’t keep destroying things. This place could be used in the future, even if just temporarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the two steam towers whistled mournfully as the gates slowly closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye waved his hand, and a city guard officer duly presented him a map. The nearest clan lord possessed sharp eyes and noticed that it was a map of Tidehark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye scanned the map briefly, saying, “Everyone, wait here for a while. I need to do something and will be back soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, he left alone with no concern about everyone’s expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The conference hall fell into silence. The clan lords exchanged glances, not knowing what Qianye wanted to do. Even though they had their own guesses, they still felt that the notion was too ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The uncomfortable silence didn’t last too long before Qianye reappeared at the doors and, with a flash, back on the throne. He casually tossed two heads onto the floor, saying, “Is it these two?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lords were surprised when the captives’ faces came into clear view, some even gasped. Their expressions turned odd amidst the surprise and shock. Qianye took note of them and pointed at Liu Minglun. “What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Minglun looked rather awkward, knowing that this was a job that would offend people. Yet, he had no way to back away due to his seating. He took a good look at the heads and said, “Sire, this person is Wu Chunlei, the head of the Wu family. The other is Du Xifei, a descendant of the Du family and not the clan lord himself. The Du family head isn’t in the city at the moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye raised his brows. “So that’s the case. I dragged that Du Whatchamacallit out from Madam Du’s room. I thought any man in that room had to be the clan lord. It seems I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the clan lords looked rather strange. Who would’ve thought they would hear such an exciting piece of gossip here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye ordered the heads to be removed. “Regardless, the trip wasn’t in vain. I did get one correct head. As for Du Xiyuan, I will get him if he dares return to Tidehark. Enough with that, let’s get down to business.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan lords straightened their backs and readied themselves to listen. Even Gao Mingtang’s group leaned forward ever so slightly, lest they miss a single word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye said, “I heard the Great Qin Empire left certain assets in the neutral lands, and the Eastern Sea is no exception. As the biggest city here, Tidehark is definitely housing military spies. I know many of you have connections to them. I want all of their heads!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan lords had already been shocked several times today, mainly because Qianye’s every move was unexpected. Who would’ve thought Qianye would demand such a thing first and foremost?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This request wasn’t difficult, but neither was it easy. More importantly, Qianye had been fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the Imperial army just a while ago. Why would he make such a demand? Could it be that he was testing everyone’s loyalty?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye noticed their thoughts. “The Empire is big and there are many factions within it. It just so happens that I have a fight to pick with the faction they’ve assigned here. I think it’s time for me to clear out these annoying things, and I’ll start at Tidehark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he paused slightly to look at the family heads. “I might cooperate with the Empire from time to time, but don’t ever think I’ll reconcile with this faction. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan lords were shaken as they realized Qianye’s determination. They also heaved a small sigh of relief—countless people would turn into cannon fodder if Qianye had a vendetta against the Qin Empire, but personal grievances were a different matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Chuansheng cupped his fist. “Sire Qianye, there are some difficulties in doing this. May I speak?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye said, “We’re no longer strangers inside this hall. Speak freely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Chuansheng said, “The Empire does have some strongholds in the city, and I know some of them. However, those strongholds were set up by Heavenly Monarch Zhang, even acquiring one of the houses personally. How could he not know if you clear them out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye replied calmly, “I’m the city lord here, so it’s fine as long as I want to do it. It’s not important what Zhang Buzhou thinks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Chuansheng’s expression shifted slightly. “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Understanding was one thing, but what he would actually do was another thing entirely. The other clan lords were also quiet. No one knew whether they would unite together on the same front or delay change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye said carelessly, “I know what you’re all thinking, but you should know after seeing those two heads that it’s not time to think about how you will survive against Zhang Buzhou. What you need to think about is how to get past me. If you don’t pass the test now, there’s no need to worry about him anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lu clan lord took a step forward. “Sire, you’re putting us in a very difficult position. Technically, your position was also conferred by Heavenly Monarch Zhang…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye stopped him with a raised hand. “I got this position on my own. It was indeed announced by Zhang Buzhou, but that doesn’t mean he gave it to me. No need to stress this matter when talking to me. Speaking from a different angle, many people are pretending not to know about that announcement. Would you say they’re rebelling against Zhang Buzhou?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Mingtang dragged Lu Dinghan back. “Sire, the heavenly monarch is a person of great virtue and prestige. What you’re doing is… not thorough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s none of my concern. I want to see the people from the military disappear from the neutral lands. Nothing else is in my consideration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then how about driving them away?” Gao Mingtang asked cautiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, uproot them. Understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clan lords noticed Qianye’s killing intent, and even the three big families no longer dared to say anything. They exchanged glances before falling silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye scanned the hall, saying, “I want to see no mishaps regarding this operation. Whatever connections you may have had with them in the past is meaningless to me. If you can’t get this matter done, I can do the same with soldiers from Southern Blue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This stance was representative of Qianye’s handling of this matter and the subsequent outcome. This would undoubtedly be a disaster for the families here. Not daring to say anything else, the lords headed back to arrange matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That night, flames rose up into the sky over Tidehark. Several buildings were reduced to ashes, and no one inside managed to escape.</span></p>
