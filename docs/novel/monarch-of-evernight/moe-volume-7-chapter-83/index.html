 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was simply no end to these things—no matter how many he killed, there would always be more to replace them. Filled with killing intent, Qianye headed toward the enemy in large strides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon was shocked out of her wits. “What are you doing? Are you mad?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of armored warriors surged toward Qianye like a black tide. At a glance, they seemed poised to devour the skies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qianye’s combat arts had reached a stage of great success. His gait alternated between various speeds as he weaved through the horde and arrived in their midst. The movements of all the armored troops turned sluggish for a short moment which—to experts like Qianye and Bluemoon—was enough to do many things. East Peak seemed weightless as it danced about, slashing off half a dozen legs in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s well-timed slashes removed only one leg from every soldier. This left the armored warriors still capable of fighting but drastically reduced their combat strength. Even the city guard could pick them off in large numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other end of the battlefield, Bluemoon’s eyes were filled with apprehension. Soon afterward, she spun her cannon around and began strafing the enemy formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The troops on her side were all subordinate troops of the Spider Emperor and Wolf King. Their numbers were large, but most of them were ordinary rank-two soldiers, making the Vulcan Cannon a bonafide killer weapon against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the cannon reached its set speed, streams of metal gushed out amidst the earth-shattering rumble. Soon, they converged into flaming dragons that swept through the enemies in front!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the Vulcan Cannon had become red-hot, and despite her discontent, Bluemoon had no choice but to stop firing. In front of her, the messy slums had turned into level-ground. A mixture of splinters and flesh paved the ground, turning the area into a special cemetery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The special-model Vulcan Cannon in Bluemoon’s hands was even more powerful than the ones installed on airships. A single shot from it was enough to tear ordinary people apart; there was no such thing as an intact corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a large gap had been dug out in the enemy formation. A single round of raking fire had cut down hundreds of soldiers. The cannon seemingly possessed the firepower of the god of fire, but the main reason for this accomplishment was Bluemoon’s marksmanship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enemy morale fell to an all-time low. The lucky survivors were either standing in a daze or had turned to flee. Either way, this assault wave had come to a halt here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon felt somewhat satisfied after venting her anger. She glanced in Qianye’s direction, only to find his receding figure. In his previous location was a group of staggering armored warriors who had lost one leg. The difficult movement caused them to bump into one another, throwing the group into a pitiful mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Bluemoon’s eyes, these sitting ducks were the best targets for her Vulcan cannon. However, she wasn’t at all delighted—this group of armored warriors that had forced her to flee was unbearably weak against Qianye. They couldn’t even make him use his true powers. Besides, she wasn’t really enthused about slaughtering crippled enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dammit! Do you think I’m only capable of dealing with these cripples? If it wasn’t for this accursed place, how can I be taken so lightly?” Bluemoon gnashed her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Yueyuan’s voice rang out near her. “Miss Bluemoon, I’ve come to help you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Yueyuan was stunned as he landed beside her and scanned the battlefield. At his level of strength, no number of ordinary soldier corpses was enough to alarm him. What truly startled him was the group of armored soldiers who were struggling to clamber up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who did this?” Su Yueyuan’s expression was serious. At this point in the battle, he naturally knew how difficult it was to tangle with the armored soldiers. He himself couldn’t cut down so many of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t know!” It was clear that the girl didn’t want to reply. The Vulcan Cannon in her hand rumbled once more as she sprayed the half-crippled soldiers with bullets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Yueyuan had also noticed this and asked no more questions. Instead, he went forward with his spear to finish off the grounded enemies one by one. He was panting a bit after killing all of them—these fellows possessed an astonishing level of defense and vitality, and it was difficult to kill them even when they were simply lying there. Su Yueyuan didn’t know where their vitals were, so he had to spend at least three spear thrusts to kill one armored soldier. Even someone like him would feel strained after killing a dozen or so in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon had already run out of ammo and the group following her was hurriedly reloading her cannon. Taking advantage of this rare interlude, Su Yueyuan gazed at the armored soldier corpses and sighed. “Which powerful expert actually half-crippled so many steel-armored warriors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t know.” Bluemoon tossed out the same stiff answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the masked man slammed the armrest of his seat. The Spider Emperor’s treasured throne was completely destroyed, and the floor below began to crack. The man himself was naturally unaffected—he remained floating in the air in a sitting position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of the vampires and arachne in the room plopped to the floor, suppressed by the man’s might and killing intent. Only a handful of the strongest experts could barely remain on their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are we losing so many puppet warriors!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the prostrating vampires said, “Sire, please contain your anger. I-I don’t know the reason, either, only that we have lost contact with seven hundred of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be Su Dingqian attacking in secret?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The masked man snorted, “It’s not him. If he attacks, this seat will definitely know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, it must be Liu Daoming. That old bastard has always been crafty, perhaps he’s hiding some powerful methods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a moment of silence, the masked man said, “Since that’s the case, then have the experts of every race charge in!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the best time for experts to mobilize. The situation inside Port City was chaotic—the people on Su Dingqian’s side were familiar with the landscape, and they were being overseen by a divine champion. The ability to mask the aura was already a great advantage for the defenders, to speak nothing of other home ground boons. Hence, it wasn’t time for experts with special identities to take action. The ones entering the city at this point were all cannon fodder and exiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the masked person’s patience seemed to have run out due to the disastrous loss of puppet warriors, deciding to rush the experts on his side onto the battlefield. At this point, no one dared to dissuade this dangerous masked man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A while later, half of the people in the cabin were gone. The crystalline spider’s eyes lit up once more as the Spider Emperor’s will arrived. “Mask, don’t be rash.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The masked man snorted coldly, “I want to go for a walk in Port City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now is not the time to put the cards on the table. On the contrary, we have to prevent both parties from doing so. We have to let him believe that us occupying Port City is only temporary and that he’ll have the chance to take it back later on. Killing all of his subordinates and children will only get us a mad divine champion, nothing good will come out of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, our losses…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spider Emperor said meaningfully, “There’s a limit to the losses. Even if they destroy all of the puppet warriors, can it compare to our grand scheme? Don’t forget that this matter is related to our advancement. It’ll be a whole new world once we take this step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seemingly moved, the masked man sat down with a snort. His seat had been pulverized, but a stream of cold energy condensed under him to form a dark throne of ice, atop which he took his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spider Emperor heaved a sigh of relief. “How about this? I’ll also mobilize the giant warbeasts and give him a bit more pressure, lest unexpected problems arise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The masked man nodded slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The roar of giant warbeasts echoed once more under the night sky, and soon, the earth began to tremble under the steps. Countless airships braved the defensive fire to land near the city walls, releasing a tide of soldiers into Port City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was left of the city defenses crumbled quickly, and Qianye, who was fighting inside, felt a sharp increase in pressure. From his position, he could make out the silhouette of two large warbeasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The warbeasts are here again?” Qianye felt somewhat depressed. He knew the other party was going all out, intent on taking Port City in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye charged toward a group of steel-armored warriors. The area around these soldiers was usually empty because they couldn’t differentiate between friend and foe. It was clear that these weapons made up the main enemy force, and with Qianye’s experience, he could see that their construction was costly. The city wasn’t going to last long without Su Dingqian taking action. He had to take advantage of the chaos to kill more of these creatures and lessen future burdens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye was all too familiar with these armored warriors at this point. He would hack off a large swathe of elephant legs with a combination of his domain and sword, leaving them half-crippled. This was even faster than cutting them down one by one, not to mention leaving these war puppets half-destroyed would pose a greater headache for the enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Qianye had reaped a dozen or so armored warriors. Just as he was charging toward the next battlefield, his steps came to a sudden halt and his upper body leaned backward, barely evading a grey, mist-shrouded bullet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That heavily-armored knight appeared in front of Qianye. The man looked at him with cold eyes and said, “Was it satisfying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye glanced toward where the bullet had come from, but as expected, the grey figure was nowhere to be found. The sniper’s marksmanship was first-class and he possessed even greater talents in stealth. How could he be so easy to spot? But one thing was certain—he had already picked a new location and was waiting for Qianye to reveal an opening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need to look, you won’t find him. You still haven’t answered me, was the slaughter satisfying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The knight shot a glance at the flailing armored soldiers. Despite their lack of expression, he could hear the anger and frustration in their voices. “Very well, it seems most of the puppet warriors were lost in your hands. Since that’s the case, you don’t need to leave this place alive tonight. Unbreakable Bulwark!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The origin shield appeared once more. The knight raised his aegis with both hands and stood unmoving like the mountains. However, he felt somewhat puzzled when he saw that Qianye wasn’t using that shockingly powerful grade-seven gun, but instead an unassuming sword.</span></p>
