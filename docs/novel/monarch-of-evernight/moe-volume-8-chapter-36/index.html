 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere in the ancient Totemic Castle froze up and plunged into silence. No one wanted to answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has Bloodbeard returned?” The Wolf King repeated sternly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, an old werewolf took a step forward. “Great Chief, Bloodbeard was dispatched to Southern Blue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that! It’s been so long, has he not sent word?” The Wolf King’s voice grew increasingly cold and was apparently at a tipping point. If Bloodbeard had stopped reporting after his departure, it could be that he had other ambitions or that he simply didn’t care about the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old werewolf was the newly appointed shaman. He hesitated for a moment before speaking cautiously, “Great Chief, there was news from Southern Blue just now, Bloodbeard…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speak!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marquis Bloodbeard was heavily injured by Qianye in Southern Blue. The latter caught up to him soon after he had fled the city, wiping out everyone, including the guards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wolf King glared furiously, filling the hall with a whirlwind of killing intent. He was well beyond angry at this point. Despite his arrogance and unyielding nature, Bloodbeard was still a member of the tribe, and there was no way he could challenge the throne, either, since he wasn’t stronger than the Wolf King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But with his death, the tribe had lost a great general and the Wolf King, a capable subordinate. The king was already at a slight disadvantage against the Spider Emperor and Moonlight Demons. Now that he was weakened, the power balance in the future was going to be difficult to manage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was that Qianye again! That damned Qianye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wolf King finally managed to suppress his anger. “Has someone gone to check the scene? What’s the situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The scene… is a bloody mess, all the corpses have been dismembered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the Wolf King was surprisingly calm as he recalled that mysterious white-dressed girl and the grotesque cleaver in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young girl’s strength was mediocre, but her ability to grasp openings was almost unbelievable. Even the Wolf King found it difficult to block her attacks as they would always go for the weakest spots at the most opportune timing. Nonetheless, the Wolf King was even more apprehensive of her than he was of Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did Ji Rui say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This information was relayed by the city lord. He said that he was caught off-guard by the sudden development. Bloodbeard ran out of the city immediately after he was ambushed, summoning all of the guards along with him. Ji Rui himself remained in the city to hunt down Qianye. He proceeded to scour the surroundings once he was done searching the city, and that was when he found Sire Bloodbeard’s corpse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wolf King snorted deeply. His eyes narrowed with murderous intent as he said in a cold voice, “This Fatty Ji really knows how to avoid responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The new shaman said, “Regardless, Sire Bloodbeard was ambushed in his territory, so there’s no way he can escape the blame. Since he doesn’t want to shoulder responsibilities, why don’t we relieve him of Southern Blue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wolf King’s expression changed slightly. He seemed somewhat moved, but after some thought, he said while shaking his head, “Southern Blue is indeed a gold mine. Fatty Ji was able to build up a fortune because the Spider Emperor, Mask, and I were keeping one another in check. No one was willing to let the other party take Southern Blue. On the other hand, Ji Rui is a genius in business. Any other person in his shoes might not perform that well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shaman said, “Are we just going to let this matter be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course not. Bloodbeard was escorted there by Ji Rui, and now, he had died on Southern Blue soil. How can we let him off without bleeding him dry?” With that, the Wolf King assigned two tribesmen to make for Southern Blue and extort the city lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Martyr’s Palace had just jumped out of the void and appeared outside of the Northern Continent. The installation of the ballistae and kinetic sails required a large number of technicians. It wasn’t possible for the twenty-some crew onboard to accomplish this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the span of a dozen or so days, the Highbeard ancestral land had transformed once again. Many large buildings had begun to take shape, and the road toward the shore had already stretched ten kilometers. At this point, the last batch of imported materials had been used up, and the Highbeards were already starting to draw on the local resources. They were intent on keeping up progress even if they had to mine for materials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martyr’s Palace landed gently beside the Highbeard ancestral lands. Qianye handed the ballistae and kinetic sails adjustment to Bluemoon, while he himself headed back to the Warm Lake Valley to cultivate in isolation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this tranquil environment, time passed by like a calm stream—a dozen days passed by unknowingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye cultivated day in and day out, almost forgetting the passage of time entirely. Little Zhuji slept by his side all this time. The circulating origin power around Qianye was the most comfortable environment for the little fellow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was curled up into a ball, like a dreaming little kitten. From time to time, crisp crackling sounds would emerge from her bones and joints as she experienced growth. This rate was far beyond that of an ordinary human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even while cultivating, Qianye could sense that the girl’s location was like a small black hole, absorbing the nearby origin power without end. There wouldn’t be so much energy in the air under normal circumstances. Her ability to draw origin power and grow while sleeping was something even Qianye felt envious about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The little fellow’s absorption rate could be considered terrifying. Any other person in Qianye’s place would find his cultivation rate slowed down significantly. This, however, wasn’t a problem for him because he could close this gap with two cycles of the Profound Combatant formula, a mere hour of extra work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no day or night during cultivation, and it seemed like this august period would never end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, however, Qianye felt his heart skip a beat due to the changes in the surrounding origin power. As such, he slowly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later, a black dot appeared over the distant horizon. The black dot turned into a fleet of airships flying toward the Northern Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These airships were intercontinental models with neither insignia nor identification on their hulls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, Qianye immediately spotted Song Zining standing on the deck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the little fellow clambered up as though she had sensed something. “Is Mama back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, let’s go and welcome him.” Qianye picked Zhuji up, jumped out of the valley, and flew toward the ancestral land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fleet was made up of four airships: one warship and three cargo vessels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fleet picked an even area outside of the ancestral land and performed a gradual descent. Song Zining jumped down as the vessels were a hundred meters from the ground and laughed loudly. “Your young master is back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye punched him in the chest, saying, “That was pretty quick!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Naturally!” Song Zining pointed at the three armed cargo ships and said, “My entire fortune is here, please don’t scam me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, he tossed Qianye a list. The latter was positively shocked upon glancing through its contents. The three airships contained thirty sets of heavy excavation machinery, two sets of refinery equipment, two kinetic tower cores, and an entire metal-processing line. There were also numerous machines for manufacturing fine parts as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With these things, a basic manufacturing facility would come into shape. Most of the machinery were second-hand goods, but they were fairly close to the latest models. They were high-quality goods that couldn’t be found in the neutral lands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from this, Song Zining had brought close to five hundred people, all of them veterans who had followed him for many years. With these men coming in, Song Zining’s forces would surpass the Highbeard population and reform the power balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The duty of receiving the new personnel and settling them in was left to Bluemoon, Red Lotus, and some Ningyuan Stewards. Song Zining selected an area neighboring the Highbeard ancestral land, firmly blocking their northward expansion. To their west was the mountain range, to the east was Qianye’s Warm Lake Valley, and the southern parts bordered the Eastern Sea—this effectively locked them inside a circle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluemoon was clearly not happy, but she was also quite clear about her position, so she didn’t try to dispute. The area currently marked out for the Highbeards had far surpassed their capacity. Even with their high rate of reproduction, it would take over ten years to fill up this space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the subordinates had gone off to work, Song Zining grabbed Qianye’s shoulder and said mysteriously, “I’ve found a good way to solve the issue of your Martyr’s Palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What method?” Qianye asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martyr’s Palace was the key to his future path to the Sacred Mountain. Without this time-traversing warship, Qianye would be wiped out by the endless stream of Evernight vessels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the greatest potential problem with the Martyr’s Palace—and also the strongest defensive mechanism—was the power left behind by the Pointer Monarch, a trap that could kill a divine champion. It was exactly because of this defensive power that Qianye could never touch the core of the Martyr’s Palace, the Earth Dragon’s heart, or learn what kind of mechanism was hidden inside of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the monarch were to find out about the airship coming into being, he might rush over to seize control of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what Song Zining was talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was one thing puzzling Qianye—as influential as Song Zining was, how was he going to affect the Pointer Monarch? In truth, all the heavenly monarchs were unreachable existences, and being able to stick around Zhang Boqian was already an extraordinary opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining only responded with a mysterious smile and said, “You’ll know soon. Bring me to the Martyr’s Palace, I want to see how much it has progressed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After boarding and touring the airship, Song Zining said with a frown, “How come there are only four ballistae? What can you do with this number? I remember you had enough money to buy ten.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye laughed. “These four are free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the seventh young master became spirited. “Free? How come there’s such a good thing? What happened, tell me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Simple, Ji Rui worked with the Wolf King to ambush me. In the end, I escaped and received four ballistae as compensation for settling this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wolf King!!!” Song Zining was shocked. Countless leaves danced about Qianye, scanning him from head to toe. The seventh young master felt relieved only after finding no injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression turned gloomy. “This Fatty Ji is really bold, is there anything he doesn’t dare to do? Does he think this young master is so easy to push around?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite having known him for so long, Qianye had never seen Song Zining so angry—he was even gnashing his teeth. He quickly patted the latter’s shoulder and consoled him. “As you can see, I’m fine. A mere Wolf King can’t kill me. Don’t forget that I’ve escaped from a divine champion more than once. You guys are not my match in terms of running away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining looked somewhat better. He forced a faint smile, but that didn’t stop his killing intent from spilling out.</span></p>
