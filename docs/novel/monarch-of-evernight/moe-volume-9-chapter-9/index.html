 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Imperial Military?” Song Zining said after a while. “Ask them to wait in the parlor, I’ll be there soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Zhang was seated together with two attendants in the parlor. Song Zining was stunned as his gaze fell upon one of them. “General Lan, why are you dressed like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng turned to smile at Fang Zhan. “Didn’t I tell you we can’t fool the seventh young master? You don’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Zhang wasn’t quite satisfied, however. “He has never seen you before, how could he recognize you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining didn’t keep the man in suspense. “There’s an art in divination similar to origin power perception. General Lan never did disguise himself, so I can see his rank-sixteen cultivation and the sharp intent in his origin power. That would be his trademark Silken Gold Needles, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Zhang raised a thumb. “I’m convinced. The seventh young master has extraordinary eyesight! Normally, we can’t even see through his cultivation when he’s not using it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just some small tricks, not worth mentioning. Besides, I’m no longer of the Song clan, so I won’t be using that name anymore. You two can just call me Zining.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mister Zining, we won’t beat around the bush anymore. We came to trade for the resources remaining in Qianye’s hands. We also want to report something and see if you can help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining said, “Please speak freely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came to deliver the latest warship model, something we agreed upon with General Qianye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining was fairly surprised. “You really got your hands on that thing? From what I know, there are only three such airships?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are six more at the shipyard, so there won’t be a shortage in the future. Losing one of them now, however, makes things a bit difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining opened his fan and swung it a few times. “Offering such an airship amidst all that difficulty, it seems someone really wants the things in Qianye’s hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly. The Empire is extremely sincere this time, so please put in some good words for us and make this deal happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The deal aside, what information did you have to give me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng sent the other attendant out with a wave of his hand. “The Empire is planning to attack the void continent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The void continent? Aren’t things in a stalemate over there?” Song Zining frowned. He had taken part in the war back then and witnessed the defeat on all fronts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aristocracy performed differently in the war, but everyone could agree that things changed the night Qianye betrayed the Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the solid proof of his vampire identity and the military’s unerring position, everyone knew how Qianye had risked his life in every battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the several battles between the Empire and Evernight, people like Qianye, Zhao Jundu, and Song Zining were gradually tempered to become characters capable of shouldering great responsibility. In the younger generation, Qianye was considered one of the most promising youths to breakthrough to the heavenly monarch realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This information had been circulating privately since long before. Without the military’s meddling, his identity would have never been revealed. What did it actually matter if he was human or vampire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the direct effects, Li Fengshui’s methods also shook the major clans and families. The reason was that the military was reaching too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhao clan had long since made it clear that Qianye would enjoy the treatment of a core member of the clan. Those endorsing this statement weren't just the well-protected Zhao Jundu, but also Duke You and Duke Chengen. After Qianye’s escape following Li Fengshui’s death, the other aristocracy never blamed the Zhao clan taking his side. On the contrary, they secretly expressed their displeasure toward the military.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secretly investigating a core scion and genius of a major clan could be considered crossing the line. If even the Zhao clan was investigated, how could any other clan be spared? Besides, the military’s methods were unscrupulous, actually resorting to kidnapping someone close to Qianye. Who wouldn’t be wary of such methods? Qianye had a bloodline problem, fine, but what about other people? What if they “find proof”?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jundu’s hearing was the last straw that broke the camel’s back. Not to mention his personal combat strength, potential, and status in the Zhao clan, he was the child of Princess Gaoyi, one of the only two Imperial Princesses. If the military had designs on such a person, was there anyone they didn’t dare to touch?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heirs were the foundation of a lineage. This sent a chill down the spines of everyone who had close ties to the military.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why the aristocracy had performed poorly during the short period that the military took over Zhao Jundu’s warzone. The Zhao clan drew back without putting in any effort, and the other clans cut off all reinforcements and support, focusing only on their own regions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empire was weaker, to begin with, so how could they endure such a breakdown in formation? The situation deteriorated rapidly and the frontline collapsed toward the Zhao clan’s core defensive line. Only then did Zhao Jundu step in hurriedly to salvage the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the ground battle at a disadvantage, the air battles were even worse. The aristocratic private armies would retreat once the situation was dire, leaving the Imperial clan’s palace guards at the frontlines. The private armies could retreat, but the Imperial guard couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several grueling battles, the Imperial guard fleet suffered heavy casualties due to the lack of cooperation. Although the dark races suffered heavier losses, they had an almost endless supply of troops pouring in while the Imperial guard was alone without reinforcements. After losing a third of their fleet, the Imperial guard could no longer hold the line and had to retreat back to the skies above Indomitable, giving away air dominance over the entire void continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grievous losses incited the wrath of the Imperial clan, and of the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite his fury, the Imperial clan couldn’t do much against this situation. The military was the first to cross the line. The source of all these small secret operations was the desire to centralize power, and of course, there was proof for Qianye’s crimes. On the other hand, the Imperial clan never held enough command over the private armies of the aristocracy. This wasn’t the first time these clans had prioritized self-preservation. Avoiding battle to weaken the Imperial guard was one way for them to express their dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, a heavenly monarch or marshal would usually step forward to defuse the situation. It was just that the flames this time began from the Zhao clan’s twin stars, so even a marshal couldn’t suppress the dissent. However, the Pointer Monarch and Prince Greensun remained silent, and Lin Xitang’s injuries had relapsed; no one even knew where he was. The other marshals weren’t as skilled as Lin Xitang or willing to invite trouble upon themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, things deteriorated into an absolute mess, and the Imperial clan could only take their anger out on the commander of the Imperial guard. However, there were only a handful of people who were proficient in aerial battles. No substitute could do the job better than the current Duke Li, who was known as one of the most capable commanders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a situation was already unsalvageable in Song Zining’s opinion. That was why he had left the war on the void continent and sought out Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Lan Xincheng was saying that the Empire planned to send more troops to the void continent, it sounded rather impossible. However, someone of General Lan’s status and character wouldn’t spout random nonsense. Song Zining decided to sit down and listen to the explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng was just about to talk when a knock came from the door. “Sire Qianye is back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining stood up and said, “Invite him over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then turned to Lan Xincheng. “You don’t mind Qianye listening, do you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng replied, “Not at all. This matter might require Sire Qianye’s assistance as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye entered moments later and was surprised to see the two people inside. “You’re quite fast.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng and Fang Zhang stood up to welcome Qianye. After explaining their intention to trade, they said, “The Empire wishes to send more troops to the void continent. We seek help from you two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye and Song Zining exchanged glances. “Now that’s going to be difficult. To be honest, I just uprooted all of the military’s assets and strongholds in Tidehark. How do we work together under such circumstances?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng laughed. “Different issues, different issues. The spies in the neutral land belong to the Minister of the Right. General Qianye removing them would even delight certain higher-ups in the military. Even the elder monarch might feign ignorance about it. After all, you’re the one who had helped him the most.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That means, I actually did the right thing?” Qianye said in a mocking tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng wasn’t angry. He said with a smile, “Of course, the timing is just right under present circumstances. Your enmity with the Minister of the Right’s faction is already too deep. He won’t be able to suppress the backlash from his subordinates without killing you, but he can’t do it openly or during a major event. Who would dare attack you during a nationwide operation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye raised his brows, but Song Zining only adopted a spurious smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apparently, it was meaningless to keep arguing. Qianye invited the other two to sit down after taking his seat. “Let’s talk about what’s going on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Empire wishes you and Song Zining to lead an airship fleet and attack the enemy’s flank. Then, you should return to the void continent and help the main force in expelling the dark races once and for all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While saying this, Lan Xincheng produced a document containing the plans. The bag was sealed with an intricate mechanism made up of tiny cogs that were as thin as hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining was familiar with this design. It was even more reliable than the Rockheart Jade Letters because the mechanism was also a seal of sorts. The special material and high technology prevented any form of forgery. The mechanism was only good for a single use, and once jammed, the only way was to force it open. It also prevented experts from reading the contents with origin power, so it was virtually impossible for the letter to be opened midway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining released the mechanism and read the contents of the letter inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a detailed battle plan with many interconnected segments, both intricate and impressive. Song Zining couldn’t help but hold his breath while reading it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye knew a bit about strategy by this point. He felt that the arrows representing attack routes on the map were so heavy that it felt stifling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining said after several glances, “The work of an expert.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng said, “How rare for something to receive Mister Zining’s praise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining said seriously, “That’s not correct. This isn’t praise but admiration! Someone who can draft up such a plan must be vastly superior to myself. I probably won’t reach that level even after a decade. There can’t be more than ten such characters in the Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lan Xincheng was somewhat surprised. “Mister Zining definitely has good eyesight. This plan was drafted by Marshal Lin Xitang himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal Lin!?” Song Zining and Qianye were both surprised. Now, the weight of this plan was different from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining and Qianye studied the entire plan again. Truth be told, they had the same idea while looking at the strategy. The plan was great, but it placed great requirements on execution. Some of the key nodes were a risk even for Qianye, not to mention Song Zining. They would need careful consideration and consultation before going ahead with it. If this plan came from Lin Xitang, he must’ve made other rescue plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, Song Zining still looked solemn. There was a specially marked red line on the plan—it began from a void battle, then circled past the battlefield to attack the enemy main camp. This line was the path designated to Song Zining and Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining looked up and asked, “Where is Marshal Lin currently?”</span></p>
