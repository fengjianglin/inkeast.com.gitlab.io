 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female insects that had laid eggs pounced on the males they had just mated with and devoured them. The male bugs seemed completely exhausted and had no strength left to escape. All they could do was struggle feebly and cry out in anguish as they were swallowed whole. After eating up the males, the female insects started bulging up once more and yet another batch of eggs entered the soil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After two waves of egg-laying, there were no longer any male insects on the surface. The surviving female insects started attacking one another, and the survivors then began laying the third batch of eggs. This process was repeated until there was only one female bug left. Seeing no more food in sight, it also drilled into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In less than an hour, the swarm of insects had demonstrated their entire life cycle to Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Acting on a sudden idea, Qianye moved to where the last female insect had vanished and dug out a large clump of soil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground was so hard that Qianye could feel slight pain from his fingertips; it was really no different from digging out a large piece of steel. Yet that bug had drilled through it as though it were tofu. That was somewhat terrifying now that he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having tested out the strength of the soil, Qianye no longer used his hands. He swiftly produced East Peak and began using it as a shovel. He had to dig for an entire three meters before he found that female insect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last insect had produced a shell on its back and curled up into an immobile ball. If it wasn’t for the faint origin power fluctuations coming from its body, Qianye would’ve thought it was already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He picked up the bug but didn’t know what to do with it. After some thought, he dug out some soil with which to encase the bug, and then stowed it away in Andruil’s Space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye was drenched in sweat after digging that pit. Since he had started cultivating, this was the first time he had felt such fatigue multiple times in a single day. This gave him a new understanding of the cruelty and hardships of this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, there were no signs of those eggs even after digging so deep. Apparently, they had drilled even deeper in. But Qianye wasn’t quite interested in the tens of thousands of eggs, so he simply let them be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye jumped out of the pit and burned away the soil on him with a wave of sanguine flames. He then changed into a fresh set of clothes from Andruil’s space, immediately feeling more comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up to this point, Qianye had seen no source of water apart from the distant lake. However, his instinctive senses were telling him not to approach that place no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of darkness flickered across Qianye’s countenance. There wasn’t a lot of water left in Andruil’s space. The unconscious Li Kuanglan couldn’t eat, but she had to drink water. Food wasn’t that important for experts at their level, but water couldn’t be omitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye walked out of the cave and jumped onto the hill to observe the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance was an uneven stretch of hills, covered in verdant grass and sparse trees. The sky was already bright at this moment, but there were no signs of birds or beasts, nor were there any traces of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After observing for a while, Qianye decided to head toward the hilly region. The presence of grass and trees meant that there was an underground water source. With East Peak in hand and his ancient vampire constitution, he would surely be able to dig something out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he might be able to dig out some water in the forest, the sense of danger there was too strong—it was only a bit less than the sea and even stronger than on the rocky beach. With Li Kuanglan injured, Qianye wasn’t keen on stirring up unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He returned to the cave, picked up Li Kuanglan, and made for the hills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he stepped into the hilly region, the formless pressure in his heart lessened significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The landscape here was uneven with numerous scattered hills and ravines. Qianye soon found a natural cave, also a beast lair whose owners were nowhere to be found. After cleaning the place with sanguine fire, Qianye laid Li Kuanglan down gently and made ready to explore after a moment of rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having experienced one day and night here, Qianye was clear that the nights were more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At night, all creatures would find their bodily functions slowing down as though they were about to go into hibernation. Even Qianye’s fighting power would be greatly reduced in that state. It would be quite disastrous if he were to run into a nocturnal beast. That was why he would need to explore the surroundings clearly during the daytime and exterminate all potential dangers. Only then would he have a peaceful night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Carefully placing Li Kuanglan on the ground, Qianye couldn’t help but feel an instinctive urge after seeing her face, neck, and largely exposed shoulders. He wanted to tear apart the internal armor and hold the white flesh within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, he was equipped with ample experience. He immediately activated his Venus Dawn origin power and suppressed the urge as soon as it arose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just about to stand up after regaining clarity when a hand suddenly appeared and dragged him back by the collar. Li Kuanglan’s wooden countenance appeared before him. “What did you do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye couldn’t figure out the situation immediately. He said joyfully, “You’re awake! This is wonderful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was genuinely delighted. Li Kuanglan would be able to channel her own origin power to heal her injuries only after regaining consciousness. No matter how strong Qianye’s Venus Dawn was, it couldn’t be used for regeneration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan bit her lower lips. “Wonderful your ass! This young master… now that I’m awake, it’s time for you to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She hadn’t even finished speaking when five slender fingers reached for Qianye’s throat and a punch made for his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A groan of pain echoed in the cave, but it wasn’t Qianye’s. It was from Li Kuanglan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her left hand was wracked with stabbing pain, and that powerful punch sent waves of pain throughout her body. Punching Qianye was no different from attacking a steel plate. He was completely fine, but her hand was now swollen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling completely powerless, Li Kuanglan collapsed once again. Despite that, the hand she had on Qianye’s neck didn’t loosen. This resulted in her dragging Qianye down on top of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Qianye could exert some force and expel her fingers, but he gave up on the notion after seeing her resolute demeanor. He merely bent down accordingly to prevent her from overexerting. One had to remember that the bones throughout her body had just been reconnected. That punch from just now had probably jolted several fractures out of place, evidenced by the pain she was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan struggled to stand up, but her grip on Qianye’s hand was quite strong. “Y-You, what did you do to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I treated your injuries.” Qianye was as calm as still water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Treatment my ass!” Furious, Li Kuanglan wanted to throw yet another lethal punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye reached out and gently pressed her back to the ground. “If you make reckless movements again, you’ll break even more bones. We’ll have to reconnect them all over again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan was hurting all over at the slightest movement, not to mention the lack of origin power. She had no power to resist and was duly pressed to the ground, grinding her teeth all the while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She observed her situation and then said with a frown, “I was injured so badly? Did you reconnect all the fractures?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye said unceremoniously, “Who else? This place is fairly dangerous. I’ll advise you not to move around recklessly. It’ll be quite troublesome to reconnect your bones if they break again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was something Qianye didn’t dare to say. Now that she was awake, it was more likely that she would slash him to death if he were to connect her bones again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you reconnect…” Her question trailed off into silence as she looked down at a certain place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye followed her eyes and found that his hand was on her chest. There was one hole each on the front and back of this internal armor, and Qianye’s hand happened to be on the defect and over half her left chest. The hole wasn’t that big, so it was fairly hard to believe Qianye wasn’t taking advantage of her deliberately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye cried out in his heart, once again losing control to his instincts. But Li Kuanglan had just woken up and thus had no idea—now, things were going to be hard to explain. If he were to withdraw his hands at the moment, it would look quite deliberate, and he might need to reconnect all her bones if Li Kuanglan were to flail about in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Qianye was in a dilemma, Li Kuanglan shifted her body, and that actually pushed her entire chest into his palm. She let out a sigh, as though she were parched and stifled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them were startled at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That, I, no… actually…” She couldn’t get the message across after a good while. Ultimately, she cried out, “Let go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye pulled back his hand accordingly. She straightened her back at this moment and seemed like she would fall onto Qianye. Li Kuanglan immediately realized this situation and exerted some force from her back, making her fall back onto the ground. She turned pale from the sudden pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye shook his head inwardly as he fished out a painkiller and injected it into her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the effects of the painkiller, the tension on Li Kuanglan’s face lessened somewhat. However, her gaze toward Qianye remained extremely complicated, and the ripples in her eyes looked like they would spill out any moment. The force with which she was biting her lips showed how much she hated him at this moment. If Qianye were to stretch his hand toward her mouth, she might just bite him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, she merely stretched her hand out. “How many more injections do you have, give them to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That was the last one,” Qianye said in honesty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan was embarrassed and angry. “Who’d believe you! You… I don’t care, just give me all the sedatives you have!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. “I really don’t have any. Who’d carry that many?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sedatives were most useful for blunting pain. As an expert, who would pay attention to a bit of pain? Li Kuanglan merely frowned when the fractured bones rubbed against one another. Comparatively, stimulants, healing, and regenerative medicines were the main stockpiles. Even toxic drugs were more useful than sedatives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that the sedatives had a special use right now. Both of them knew of this, yet neither could say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Li Kuanglan realized that he really had no more stock and couldn’t quite decide whether to be happy or disappointed. Reciting a mantra to channel origin power, she asked, “Do you have food?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye produced the food he had within Andruil’s space and supported Li Kuanglan to a sitting position. “That’s all I have. Don’t be picky and eat what’s left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan nodded silently. She then blushed as she looked down at her body. “Help me… cover up properly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The movements just now had caused her entire left chest to bulge out of the gap in the armor, and that trembling spring plum-petal was exceptionally alluring.</span></p>
