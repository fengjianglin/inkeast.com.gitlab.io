 <p>“Young Noble, you should go faster!” A tender young maid urged. Qianye had no choice but to hasten his steps and follow her to the side hall.</p> 
 <p>The place was rather quiet, and the little courtyard would be hidden from the outside world once the doors had been closed. The side hall was rather small. With just two rooms—one for rest and the other for meditation—it was only the size of an ordinary house.</p> 
 <p>The maid slammed the gates shut. Only then did she heave a sigh of relief, blurting out her thoughts, “Thank god no one saw!”</p> 
 <p>She ran into the house, saying, “Young Noble, please sit, I’ll make tea for you.”</p> 
 <p>In mere moments, she was back to offer tea. This was a new seasonal product—jade green, transparent, and deeply fragrant. Moreover, she had brewed the tea at the perfect temperature. The word perfect represented money, time, and concentration, things only a maid of a major family could afford.</p> 
 <p>Qianye currently understood a bit about the finer things in life. “Good tea, good technique.”</p> 
 <p>This type of new tea couldn’t be brewed too hot or too cold. The boiled water had to be rested for a bit before going into the pot, a rather challenging process in terms of technique.</p> 
 <p>The maid was all smiles from the praise. “You should drink more. There are quite a few good teas in this courtyard, I’ll brew them for you one after the other.”</p> 
 <p>Qianye smiled. “Such good intentions, afraid that I won’t be able to kill my way out?”</p> 
 <p>The maid was dumbstruck. “What are you talking about?”</p> 
 <p>“You’re afraid my identity will leak, and that it will attract an attack.”</p> 
 <p>The maid chuckled with her mouth covered. “Young Noble is rather insightful, but there’s no need to say that out loud, is there? The seventh young master should be here soon, you two can discuss things when the time comes. There are quite a few outsiders in the compound, and the clan lord can’t control them. Besides, even if there are no outsiders, the gossip inside our clan is quite troublesome in their own right.”</p> 
 <p>Qianye smiled indifferently. “Even with all the deception, people will find out sooner or later. That being said, there can’t be more people here than there were in Indomitable. You need not worry that I won’t be able to fight my way out.”</p> 
 <p>The maid was stunned momentarily. “There are no people from the Zhao clan here.”</p> 
 <p>These words proved that the girl possessed great knowledge and insight, not qualities an ordinary maid would have. Qianye’s successful escape from the city of Indomitable was—in addition to his own superior combat strength—in no small part due to the Zhao clan’s secret assistance.</p> 
 <p>Qianye smiled. “That is true, but I am no longer the same person I was back then. And the Song clan is full of people who fear death. There might be a lot of people, but only a few will ever dare stand in my path.”</p> 
 <p>“You look civilized enough, why are you so crude in behavior?” The maid criticized him verbally, but her sparkling eyes were all over him. Her boldness was indeed deserving of a beating.</p> 
 <p>Qianye broke into a laugh. “I never studied much when I was young.”</p> 
 <p>“The Yellow Springs trains its students in both civil and military arts. Their alumni are never brainless brutes.”</p> 
 <p>Qianye was a bit surprised by the retort. He glanced deeply into her eyes, saying, “The Song clan does have talents. It’s not every day that you see a clan member changing into maid attire in such a short time, and acting the part so well too.”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no other choice. The old ancestor’s funeral is the most important thing at hand, we mustn’t disturb her peace. Those maids are so clumsy and don’t know how to talk. It’s very likely that they’ll botch things up, so it’s better I come in person. Come, have tea!”</p> 
 <p>She placed a new pot of tea in front of Qianye, which he duly tasted. The aroma was strong but distant, a completely new realm so to speak.</p> 
 <p>While he was enjoying the flavor, the maid said, “There’s something else. Song Ziyan wanted me to check on your cultivation and character, to see if you’re worthy of her. As I see it, she has passed her best age of being so picky, and soon there won’t be anyone to marry her. I’m more of a match for you!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye almost sprayed the tea out. He finally managed to contain the urge and let out a dry cough instead.</p> 
 <p>Chuckling, the maid extended a hand. “Allow me to introduce myself officially. I’m Song Hui.”</p> 
 <p>Qianye shook her hand hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>He had planned to merely touch her hand, but Song Hui simply wouldn’t let go. She squeezed his hands a bit while offering words of praise, “So smooth!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye had imagined the worst-case scenario on his way here, where he would have to start fighting upon arrival and kill his way out of the Empire.</p> 
 <p>Who would’ve thought he would be taken advantage of by a female hoodlum?</p> 
 <p>Qianye couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. The Song clan was indeed full of capable people.</p> 
 <p>Seemingly noticing his thoughts, Song Hui laughed. “What are you thinking about? It’s just as they say… the seventh young master looks gentle but is ruthless, Zhao Jundu sees nothing else but his objective and ignores all girls, and you look fierce but you’re easily embarrassed. Haha!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye was tongue-tied, overcome by an indescribable feeling. “What the heck is all that?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing, just some secrets circulating amongst us girls. Oh, it’s no longer a secret since almost every noble girl knows about it now. Can’t help it, you three are so awesome and good-looking!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye had no idea whether or not he should respond.</p> 
 <p>Song Hui sat down beside Qianye, grabbing his hand calmly. “Young Noble Xiao Ye…”</p> 
 <p>Pfft! Qianye finally sprayed out his tea.</p> 
 <p>Song Hui patted his back with a mischievous smile.</p> 
 <p>“W-Who told you about that!?” Qianye was furious, his voice filled with killing intent.</p> 
 <p>“You can’t do anything to him even if I tell you. Why make it difficult for yourself?”</p> 
 <p>“I know now, it’s Song Zining!” Qianye gnashed his teeth. He had once dressed up as a girl and used the name Qian Xiaoye. That part of his life was a pain that couldn’t be washed away, and he wanted nothing more than to silence everyone who knew.</p> 
 <p>“Who’s calling me?” Song Zining’s voice echoed from the door.</p> 
 <p>Ashen-faced, Qianye walked out with a snort.</p> 
 <p>Song Zining was bewildered. “You came all the way here, why the rush to leave?”</p> 
 <p>Qianye said with a cold face, “I wouldn’t dare cause trouble for you.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining couldn’t make sense of the matter. “I never wanted to be the clan lord, what trouble can there be?”</p> 
 <p>“Why did you come back then?”</p> 
 <p>“I only wanted to meet the old ancestor.” Song Zining’s voice was gentle.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his withered countenance, Qianye couldn’t keep up his anger. “I remember her graceful bearing back then. I came to see you. Just do what you want to do, there’s no need to care about other people.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining hadn’t even replied when Song Hui praised, “Young Noble Xiaoye is so cool!”</p> 
 <p>Qianye’s expression turned dark, and Song Zining finally realized why Qianye looked like he was about to explode.</p> 
 <p>Song Hui wasn’t afraid, though. She stood in front of Qianye with shoulders thrown back, saying, “What, are you going to hit me? Go ahead! I won’t retaliate.”</p> 
 <p>She even took two steps forward, almost pushing her chest into Qianye. What else could the latter do but take a step back? Song Hui took two steps forward every time he took a step back, almost as though she was throwing herself into his arms.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Qianye in a constant retreat, Song Zining stood up with a stern face. “Hui, stop the mischief. Qianye has family.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t care about that. Which man doesn’t have a few wives? Besides, how dare a playboy like you talk about family and responsibility?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining was livid, but he couldn’t find the words to retort.</p> 
 <p>Seeing no other way out, Qianye extended a finger and poked Song Hui’s forehead. This stopped her from moving forward, and she couldn’t reach Qianye no matter how hard she swung her arms.</p> 
 <p>Qianye asked during this moment of safety, “Zining, what’s Miss Hui’s background?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining smiled wryly. “Hui was born to the original fifth branch, but they split off during my grandpa’s generation. That’s why she wasn’t named according to the main family’s scheme. In terms of seniority, she’s my cousin sister. She’s the most talented in our generation, too bad she was born a girl.”</p> 
 <p>Song Hui snorted. “If you think so highly of me, why did you recommend Song Ziyan to Qianye instead of me? Oh, and there’s that underage lass, Song Yunqing.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining hadn’t imagined she would remember all those things. Drenched in cold sweat, he replied sheepishly, “Umm… Ziyan isn’t capable, but she’s suitable as a housewife. As for you, you’re… too smart.”</p> 
 <p>“You mean I’m more suitable as a brother?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining remained silent in tacit agreement.</p> 
 <p>Song Hui sneered. “You beat around the bush, but ultimately, you’re just afraid that I’ll outsmart you men. I might not have many advantages over Song Ziyan, but I only need two.”</p> 
 <p>One could see how eloquent this girl was from how she could leave even Song Zining speechless. Qianye was also quite curious about the two points she had mentioned. “What are those?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m younger than her and I have the bigger chest.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining had no way to refute this reasonable argument.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the two embarrassed, Song Hui kept pushing on. “Fine, fine, my mission has been accomplished anyway. The elder assembly is about to start, aren’t you two going?”</p> 
 <p>“What was your mission?” Song Zining asked.</p> 
 <p>“Stall for time, which I did.” Song Hui didn’t try to hide anything.</p> 
 <p>Qianye and Song Zining exchanged glances. The latter said with a weird expression, “Are you really stalling for time? I think you have your personal goals.”</p> 
 <p>Why would she remind them about the elder assembly if she were truly stalling?</p> 
 <p>Song Hui smiled. “What’s wrong about me wanting to marry myself off?”</p> 
 <p>“But Qianye really isn’t suitable.” Song Zining knew of Qianye’s love for Nighteye, so he wasn’t too optimistic about her chances.</p> 
 <p>“Well, he’s definitely more suitable than someone like you.” Song Hui didn’t hold back.</p> 
 <p>Song Zining coughed. “I-I have my reasons.” He might’ve been more convincing if he wasn’t so guilty at heart.</p> 
 <p>“No one wants to know your reasons. Go, the assembly has already begun.”</p> 
 <p>Qianye glanced at Song Zining, waiting for his decision.</p> 
 <p>Song Zining thought about it for a good while. Finally, he said through clenched teeth, “I didn’t want to take part at first, but since you’re here, we should go in and listen to what those fellows are up to. Do what you want and say what you wish when we get there. There’s no need to hold back on my account.”</p> 
 <p>“Very well.” Qianye nodded.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the two leaving, Song Hui sighed softly. “I’ve done my best.</p> 
 <p>At the very least, Qianye’s killing intent had lessened greatly compared to when he had just arrived.</p>
