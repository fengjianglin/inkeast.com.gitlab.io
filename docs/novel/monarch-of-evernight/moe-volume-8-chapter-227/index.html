 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The state of affairs had become even more subtle. The vampires and demonkin were far from good friends, and the enmity between them was probably even greater than their hatred of humans. This was especially true between certain individuals and clans. Qianye adjusted his position and decided to sit this one out, simply observing the developments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward’s expression had been ugly ever since Anwen appeared. Dark purple blood energy drifted about in his eyes as he said, “Are you trying to add to the hatred between our clans?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen broke into a laugh. “I do hate vampires, but I’m not always looking for opportunities to kill them. I don’t mind cooperation if the conditions are right, but of course, that’s an occasional thing and the terms must be suitable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight stepped in. “What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Simple, I’m curious about the way you vampires will use the Constellation Well. I want three of your hexagonal blood rods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Three!?” Edward’s expression was full of killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight asked calmly, “It’s not out of the question, but Your Excellency Anwen, do you simply intend to take them away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for further discussion if this is the extent of your sincerity.” Twilight’s tone was firm. The moment she said these words, however, the stabbing pain at her back grew somewhat stronger. She glanced back at Bai Kongzhao in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen finally said, “Then I’ll take two and give you some compensation as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight and Edward exchanged glances. “That’s fine. As for the compensation…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s brows twitched ever so slightly—things would be extremely troublesome if these people reached a deal. His group would immediately find themselves at a disadvantage then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward pointed at Qianye. “The compensation is simple, team up with me and help me wipe out these humans!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye raised his brows and looked coldly at Edward and Anwen. He took a sidestep and, after several changes in position, arrived at a slightly more advantageous point where the three powers formed a triangle, with Li Kuanglan and Ji Tianqing being separated from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward smiled coldly. “You’re not running? Do you really want to fight us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen made no comment. He merely glanced at Qianye while rubbing his chin, seemingly considering how he should respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye scanned all the vampires, and then at Anwen and Bai Kongzhao, frowning ever so slightly as his eyes went past the latter. This young girl was the greatest variable in this battle as no one knew what she was thinking. Perhaps she never thought about anything and only acted on instinct. Regardless of the situation, ignoring her would only lead to a lethal disaster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye looked back at Ji Tianqing and Li Kuanglan. “You guys leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye replied, “I’ll stay behind to play with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Kuanglan wanted to say something, but Ji Tianqing dragged her away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some vampire counts wanted to circle around and chase after the two girls, but Qianye said with a cold snort, “Who dares pass by me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vampires came to a halt. They were very clear about Qianye’s combat strength, and that they were no match for someone who could push Edward back repeatedly. They would only be side-dishes unless the top experts at the scene took action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward took a step forward. “I dare, what will you do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two girls had already left at this point, and that was a relief for Qianye. “Nothing much. Let’s see who dares enter the Constellation Well while I’m around. Holy Son, you had better pray for good fortune and also be alert, don’t even think about sleeping. Otherwise, you’ll receive a shot sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward’s countenance was as gloomy as still water. Even if he and Anwen could forego their enmity and work together, it would only ensure their victory over Qianye. Whether or not they could kill him was a different matter. It would be rather problematic if Qianye were to pursue old grievances. With Anwen at the well entrance and Qianye waiting for a good opportunity to strike, Edward really didn’t dare go into the well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen observed the situation calmly, almost as though it had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After announcing his intent, Qianye closed his eyes and began recuperating, ready to confront the opponents at a moment’s notice. The situation fell into an immediate deadlock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this time that a faintly discernible gaze swept across the battlefield. As sharp as their perceptions were, everyone noticed this change and looked toward its source. It would seem that person wasn’t expecting so many experts to have gathered in this place, and his position was compromised in a moment of carelessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He simply exited his concealment and walked out of the forest. He came to a stop not far from the crowd but didn’t get any closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eden.” Qianye’s expression was solemn. There was no doubt that a powerful enemy had joined the fray, and one he would need to use the Shot of Inception on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An abundance of expressions appeared on Eden’s countenance as he saw Qianye, but one could hardly tell if it was delight or hatred. However, his expression sank the moment he looked toward the vampires, and the killing intent around him indicated his stance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward’s expression became serious—Eden of the Dark Abyss had matured too quickly. That nameless little pawn of the past had grown into an expert who could even threaten him. He and Anwen had formed a delicate balance in power, but things were different now that Eden had appeared. The only balancing factor became Qianye instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the thought of this, Edward regretted announcing his hostility earlier. Now, he was on a proverbial tiger and didn’t quite know how to get down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye remained silent because he had already expressed his stance. With him loitering on the sidelines, no one would be able to use the Constellation Well in peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight spoke at this point, “Your Excellency Anwen, is our deal still in effect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen replied with a smile, “Of course, why not? But whatever Eden does is not my business, I can’t control him, either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight then turned to Eden. “Eden, do you plan to go against the Evernight Council and stand on the human’s side?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eden sneered, “You know this type of provocation has no meaning. I don’t mind working with humans to kill you all first. No one will say anything about the means if I can turn you into corpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twilight was at a loss of words. She hadn’t expected Eden to be so decisive, leaving no room at all for maneuver. She had always been known for her eloquence in speech—she would usually find breakthrough points even in complicated conversations, but she couldn’t make full use of her skills against someone like Eden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She forced a smile and looked toward Anwen. The latter only shrugged, saying, “Don’t look at me, I have no authority over him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward felt stifled. He could ignore Anwen’s attitude, and he had fought Qianye enough to know of his strength, but now, even this Eden paid him so little heed. Considering everything, it really wasn’t the best time to attack just yet. The only way to escape this unstable situation was to leave. There was still no telling if these people could stay for very long in the Constellation Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Son waved his sleeve with a snort and made ready to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen didn’t stop him, either. “Leave one of your blood rods, I want to study it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think I’ll give it to you?” Edward was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen glanced toward Eden. “I’ll need your help with this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Naturally,” Eden agreed immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye’s role had actually become somewhat empty after the repeated changes. He merely looked on with cold eyes, waiting to observe the developments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Edward laughed coldly as he produced a sanguine crystal and shattered it with a flick of his finger. Sound waves inaudible to ordinary people spread out across the area, and very soon, three vampire marquises appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These vampires weren't as strong as Eden, but the difference was minimal. The three of them added together was enough to force the demonkin to flee. This was Edward’s hidden ace, something he wouldn’t bring out so easily, but he had suffered too much embarrassment today. Even a character like Eden dared to step on his head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vampire race’s top fighting power among the younger generation might be inferior to the demonkin, but they possessed more capable fighters overall. After all, the total demonkin population was too small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the power balance had been restored, and the vampires were even a bit stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deadlock didn’t last too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint rumble echoed through the forest, almost as though something was approaching them at a rapid pace. Its incoming speed was so fast that even the vampires and demonkin were surprised; they knew they probably wouldn’t be able to move so quickly in the forest. The newcomer’s concealment skills were wanting, but this shocking speed could easily make up for all shortcomings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, a massive shadow flew out of the forest and pounced toward the Constellation Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a massive arachne, with skin as dark as night and golden feet tips, shrouded in a mysterious black glow as he ran like the wind. One could tell that he was extraordinary just from his external appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he appeared, Edward, Eden, and Anwen all called out, “Basil!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did the arachne look downward and, much to his alarm, noticed the group below. However, he was moving so fast that he was already flying over the crowd the next moment. Flying over them meant opening up his abdominal vitals, and there was no telling who among them would attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basil’s limbs swung about briefly, shooting beams of golden radiance that weaved into a golden web. He stepped onto this airborne net and actually came to a grinding halt, and then bounced back to the forest border.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye focused on Basil’s feet. At the tip of those blade-like feet, there was a faintly discernible golden thread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That move of weaving a net and using it to fly backward was an outstanding display of aerial movement. Dealing with this fellow would be quite troublesome it seemed. Even if one could defeat him, making him stay was a completely different matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basil’s massive body remained floating one meter away from the ground. He studied the group one by one, his countenance growing uglier as he did so. The people before him were the elites of the dark race, and none of them was easy to provoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anwen greeted, “Basil, how come you’re here? Didn’t you just finish molting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basil laughed loudly. “I recovered quite fast, so I came over to see if I could meet you guys. Haha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eden frowned slightly while Anwen said with a smile, “It’s good that you’re here. The arachne were somewhat weak this time, but with you around, they will be able to reach many places. Why did you pick this place, though?”</span></p>
