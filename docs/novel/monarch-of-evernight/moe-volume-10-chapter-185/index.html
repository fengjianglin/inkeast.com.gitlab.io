 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the short time that Nighteye and Qianye were in spatial transit, the Azure King’s ancient castle had been reduced to nothingness. Even the mountain peak had been leveled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were wisps of black smoke rising from the ruins, filled with an inexplicable sense of decay. There were also scorching flames hovering in the air that were composed of daybreak origin power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With one hand outstretched, the Azure King was supporting a green barrier around him. Several mysterious experts clad in black cloaks were bombarding the barrier with bullets. At set intervals, one of the cloaked men would send a wisp of black energy drifting toward the Azure King’s shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This energy looked rather unassuming, but it was apparently quite strong since it would cause the Azure King’s shield to fluctuate intensively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great dark monarch seemed rather strained under the furious combined assault. The black-robed expert at the center possessed an aura as vast as the sea, perhaps even a bit stronger than the Azure King himself. Yet every wisp of dark energy fired would cause his body to tremble ever so slightly—the drain was apparently quite significant as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark energy would linger on the Azure King’s shield after contact. It would constantly erode the barrier and only disperse after its power had been drained. The ratio of exhaustion was almost two-to-one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure energy was the Azure King’s original blood energy, and it was anything but simple. However, the black energy was surprisingly superior in destructive power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the black-robed expert’s figure shifted in apparent movement. However, the Azure King moved to block his path toward the ring of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that his intentions had been seen through, the black-robed expert lowered his hood. The old demonkin expert beneath the cloak possessed a countenance as sharp as an eagle. He stared at the Azure King, saying, “Are you really going to stop me? Why go to all this trouble?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King said, “I knew this day would come, but I never thought you guys would move so quickly. Can’t you wait a couple more decades? Perhaps I’d have returned to the River of Blood by then and there won’t be so much trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia said, “Even a century would’ve been fine, but who would’ve thought the new world would open at such a time? We naturally cannot let it be. Speaking of which, are you really going to risk your life protecting Nighteye? Your relationship is a thing of the past. The only one in her heart after this awakening is Qianye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King smiled in a carefree manner. “You demonkin are a cold-blooded lot. It’s useless to explain since you won’t even know what sentiments are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia said, “Indeed, I do not understand those useless things. What feelings and love? All they do is make people weak. You guys have been affected too deeply. I don’t see what good can come out of it. For instance, you’re doing a very dumb thing right now. The one we want is Qianye, a hybrid who dares to claim himself as the son of darkness. And here you are protecting him? If you step aside, I can promise not to harm Nighteye’s life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King sighed. “That’s why I said you people don’t understand. I will not step aside, get to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia spoke slowly, “I was not yet born when you rampaged through the world, but now I stand here with the Sable Blessing and you are at the end of your lifespan. This battle can only end one way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King said, “It’s definitely not because of chance that the Masefield family got to where it is under your leadership. You might not be able to defeat me even with the Sable Blessing. Where is the Eternal Flame? Stop hiding since you’re already here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pale blaze slowly appeared from the void. The flames briefly took the form of a person’s silhouette, a gesture of greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King was fearless in the face of two great demonkin monarchs. “Then I won’t be holding back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eternal Flame retreated a hundred meters to indicate that he wasn’t taking part in the fight, leaving the Masefield Lord Progia to face the Azure King alone with his Sable Blessing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia was happy to comply. “The Sable Blessing might have a new owner after this fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eternal Flame’s fire flickered for a moment. “Nothing can be better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King was rather patient and waited for the two to finish their chatter. This island wasn’t suitable for a battle between great dark monarchs, let alone a group assault. The side with more people would have to spread themselves apart, and the land would collapse once the fight began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King knew why these two great dark monarchs had charged into the secret realm instead of choosing the void as a battlefield. Their primary target wasn’t to kill him but to target Qianye and Nighteye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia gazed at the distant horizon where the faint green halo was slowly receding. He shouted impatiently, “I’ll let you see the Sable Blessing’s true form!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Grand Magnum turned into a mass of black light in his hands, firing wisps of black energy toward the Azure King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter focused entirely on defense, without launching any counterattacks. “Are you not afraid the Queen will settle this score with you? No matter how strong the Demon King is, his accomplishments are still inferior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia’s assault didn’t waver. “No need for you to worry. How can the vampires contend with us when they have one less great dark monarch?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King smiled. “You want to take me down? Quite confident, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King, who had been defending all this time, suddenly made his move. He drew a rhomboid figure in the air and pushed it forward, the green light at his fingertips transforming into numerous geometric mirrors that blocked the Sable Blessing’s trajectory. The black energy vanished entirely into the mirror and shot out once again, but this time, it was aiming for Progia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The startled demonkin clan lord shot into the air, but the Azure King moved even faster. A flash of azure light erupted beneath his feet as he appeared above the enemy. There, he formed a large mirror with a swing of his hand, which slammed into Progia head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Caught off-guard, the latter crashed into the mirror and was sent flying from the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Passing through the mirror, shattering it, or even being transported into the void was within Progia’s expectations. He never would’ve imagined, though, that such a thin screen of light would send him bouncing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the body of a great dark monarch couldn’t withstand the recoil from crashing into the mirror at full speed. His vision went dim, and he could feel his head spinning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an utter embarrassment. Progia let out a furious howl, stirring wind and thick clouds within a ten thousand meter radius. Flashes of lightning danced in the clouds, almost as though the end of the world was nigh. The black-robed experts who had been attacking the Azure King realized the danger and flew out of the lightning clouds’ range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia was absolutely furious at this point. He was drawing upon the origin power of heaven and earth at full throttle, producing a zone of death for the weaker experts. There was room for others to help only because the Azure King was defending. Now that the two great dark monarchs were getting serious, they could no longer interfere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia raised his hands and shot a mass of demonic energy into the clouds. In the blink of an eye, the energy poured down in the form of countless demonic lightning bolts. An area of ten thousand meters turned into a purgatory of demonic lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King had one hand behind his back and was only brandishing his right hand like a sword. He slashed at the air above him, summoning a shade of azure light which blocked the demonic lightning. With every continued swipe of his fingers, an azure screen of light would appear around him. Finally, he pointed at Progia, and one of the giant barriers around him went spinning toward the vampire monarch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wisps of demonic energy shot out from Progia’s hands, which duly transformed into a giant axe that hacked at the incoming azure light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the azure glow shot past the interception without so much as a sound or a pause. It went straight for Progia’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vampire monarch stepped sideways to dodge the incoming attack. The green light grazed past his body and vanished into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia glanced at his arm. An extremely even opening had appeared in his robe and armor, with threads of blood slowly appearing on the exposed skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clearly, the azure glow was incomparably sharp and would cut through anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia’s expression was serious. “Your comprehension of space has reached such a level!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King said calmly, “Only some tricks I learned as a youngster, I never made any progress throughout the years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned his sword-finger around, sending even more screens of azure light spinning toward Progia from different angles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia was a great dark monarch as well. With a loud cry, he turned the demonic lightning into sharp blades that met the incoming attack. Under the assault of countless demonic swords, the azure screens of light were finally shattered one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Azure King swung his right hand at this point, and a sheet of azure radiance appeared before Progia at the speed of lightning! Even by great dark monarch standards, this azure attack was almost unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia was shocked out of his wits. He moved sideways with all his might and finally managed to evade the slash. However, the attack had cut through his helmet and left a stream of blood trickling down his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The demonkin were never known for their strong bodies, but managing to land a blow was already a big matter. Progia’s gaze toward the azure light was completely different now; it was full of seriousness and fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The azure edge was so sharp that it was almost invincible. He would’ve never imagined that this civil and almost weak-looking Azure King was so terrifying in combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King drew a circle and swung it forward, sending several azure shards toward Progia. This time, the azure glow was so fast that demonic swords couldn’t block them at all. With a loud roar, the demonkin monarch fired several threads of black energy from the Sable Blessing and escaped while the azure light was tangled up with the dark wisps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sable Blessing was extremely powerful, but its form in Progia’s hands wasn’t quite proficient in speed. Several shots were fired in succession, yet only half of the azure light shards were intercepted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Progia retreated at full speed and finally managed to evade the Azure King’s attack. However, the latter chased him down at even greater speed, slashing at him with more azure radiance. His posture didn’t even change during the pursuit, except for a hazy azure glow beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Progia fell into a miserable situation. The sky full of demonic lightning became a joke as he couldn’t use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Azure King moved with great skill, each of his attacks enough to kill a duke and heavily injure a great dark monarch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eternal Flame could no longer watch from the sidelines. Without waiting for Progia to ask for help, the blaze flickered out of existence and reappeared behind the Azure King. The Eternal Flame shot out of the fire and made straight for the Azure King’s back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great dark monarch’s attack was nothing to scoff at. The Eternal Flame had just emerged from the pale fire when he accelerated to extreme speeds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that a screen of azure light appeared before him. The monarch had no time or choice to react; all he could do was crash into it.</span></p>
