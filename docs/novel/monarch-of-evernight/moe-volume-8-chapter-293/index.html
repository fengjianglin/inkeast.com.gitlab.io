 <p>Song Zining’s refusal to attend the elder assembly caused huge waves of dissatisfaction. Almost every elder berated him for disrespecting his seniors, and his family for not teaching him manners.</p> 
 <p>All the talk about lack of manners was definitely targeted at Song Zhongnian. However, the clan lord was neither furious nor flared up. He merely listened to the complaints and sighed when no one else was around.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the elders who had denounced Song Zining in unison, the guests, the servants, the side branch members, and the younger generation of the clan was full of admiration for him. The old duchess had just passed, but the leaders of the clan were already putting up their acts. People weren’t dumb enough to be fooled by their attitude. It was only now that one could see who held deep sentiments.</p> 
 <p>Several days passed by in a flash. Song Zining remained in the same place, neither eating nor drinking. It seemed like he planned to spend forty days in this manner. Seven days of vigil was enough, according to local customs, but Song Zining felt that one week wasn’t enough to ease the sorrow in his heart.</p> 
 <p>At dawn, Song Zhongnian got up to clean himself and have breakfast before sitting down in his study with a book. There should be no new guests at this point because those who were expected to come had already arrived. Some of the important guests had also started to leave one after another. With less entertaining to do, he finally had some time to relax.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the clan lord free, the old steward said, “Master, the other elders are spreading slanderous rumors. Some of them are saying you’re too muddle-headed for the job, they want you to resign! We can’t just sit down and let them act so arrogant!”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian calmly sipped some tea. “What are they saying about Zining?”</p> 
 <p>“How can they have anything good to say? They’re all saying the seventh young master doesn’t respect his elders or have manners. They’re saying he’s no longer of the Song clan, what did he come back here for, etc.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian’s face was ashen. “These bastards would ignore right and wrong for their personal gains. I don’t think they’ll even mind if the clan collapses.”</p> 
 <p>“Exactly! Master, you must find a way! The situation doesn’t look good if this keeps on.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian sighed. “Zining was never happy with the clan, and even I have no idea what he thinks right now. It’ll be for the best if he’s willing to take over the clan lord position. It’s just that he’s too young. It’ll be difficult to convince the masses even if he’s capable!”</p> 
 <p>The old steward was anxious. “Can any other person convince the masses? Which other young master can even compare? Master, you’re thinking too much.”</p> 
 <p>The old steward kneeled down. “I’ve overstepped my bounds.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian shook his head with a wry smile. “You’re right. The old ancestor has always felt that I’m too soft-hearted and indecisive. I’m not trying too hard this time because I also feel that I’m unworthy of this position.”</p> 
 <p>The steward wanted to argue, but Song Zhongnian said, “No need to say anything. Go and check up on Zining. Who else in the entire clan is more filial? Unfortunately, it is only during such times that one gets to see a person’s true colors. If the old ancestor were to see what’s going on now, she might just reform the entire clan. Those people are the ones who don’t know manners or respect their ancestors! Sigh, let it be even if such a clan breaks apart!”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining was still kneeling there when Song Zhongnian arrived at the funeral hall.</p> 
 <p>The latter gazed at the duchess’ remains for a while before saying, “You really can endure.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine for us cultivators to go without food for a few weeks.”</p> 
 <p>“It must be tiring.”</p> 
 <p>“Not at all.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian nodded. “You should care more about the internal affairs of the clan. There’s a seat for you in the elder assembly. Although you can only discuss and not make decisions at the moment…”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining cut him short. “Let’s not talk about the clan in front of the old ancestor. She’ll get angry if she finds out.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian felt awkward. “I know you still bear ill-feelings for what happened back then. I’m to blame for not protecting you.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining shook his head. “What happened back then wasn’t a bad thing, and I’m doing quite well right now. Who would’ve thought the clansmen would be in such a rush? They’re already in discussion before forty-nine days have passed.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian’s face turned red. “There’s nothing I can do when all the branches are exerting pressure. There’s also no room for us to drag on as the situation outside is quite urgent. The old ancestor didn’t leave a single instruction as to the future arrangements of the clan, leading things to the current situation.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining said indifferently, “Even if she did leave instructions, people with different opinions will say she’s just confused in her old age.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian was furious. “Who would dare!?”</p> 
 <p>“Why would they not dare?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian sighed as his anger gradually subsided.</p> 
 <p>Song Zining said, “If you want me to manage this clan and break the stalemate, you have to know that my way of doing things is different. It’ll be too late if you want to interfere later on.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian was a bit shocked. “What are you planning?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zining replied, “Nothing. I’ll leave once the funeral is over.”</p> 
 <p>For some reason, Song Zhongnian was both disappointed and relieved. He didn’t quite understand his own intentions, either. The clan lord got up and brushed his sleeves away, saying, “There’s still some time, let me think about it.”</p> 
 <p>As he walked out of the hall, the steward approached and whispered, “Master, what else do you want to do? The young master has finally loosened his tone.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian laughed wryly. “Even if he does agree, it’ll take everything I have to elevate him to the clan lord’s position. It’s easy to make him an elder, but he won’t be satisfied with just that.”</p> 
 <p>“Master, weren’t you planning to make him clan lord?”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian let out a dry cough. “This matter is going to be difficult, and Zining doesn’t look like he’s interested.</p> 
 <p>The old steward looked like he wanted to say something, but he could only lower his head when the clan lord glared at him. “I’ve overstepped my bounds.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian shook his head with a sigh and left for his residence. It was actually time for the elder assembly to convene, but those meetings have gone on day after day with only ceaseless quarreling over personal profits. Every argument would lead to the topic of splitting up the clan.</p> 
 <p>At the thought of the assembly, Song Zhongnian felt greatly distressed. Many people were scheming openly and in secret, and the brazen retorts at the assembly made the clan lord rather unhappy. Seeing that nothing important could come up at the assembly, Song Zhongnian decided to take the afternoon off and spare himself the trouble.</p> 
 <p>It was at this moment that an attendant rushed over. He arrived huffing and puffing in front of Song Zhongnian and said, “Clan Lord, an esteemed guest has arrived!”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian’s expression sank. “What are you so flustered about? Catch your breath first!”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sire! That guest has arrived outside the courtyard and wishes to enter.”</p> 
 <p>“What kind of guest?”</p> 
 <p>The attendant glanced about and, seeing that there was no one else, whispered, “He calls himself Ye Qian and wishes to see the seventh young master.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian gasped. “It’s him? Are you sure?”</p> 
 <p>“He looks young, handsome, and almost unlike an ordinary person. I’ve seen him before while running errands outside the continent. There’s no mistaking it.”</p> 
 <p>“Why is he here?” Song Zhongnian was at a loss about what to do.</p> 
 <p>“Clan Lord, what do we do? Shall we send someone to capture him?”</p> 
 <p>“Nonsense! No one is to make reckless moves without my permission! Lead him to the side hall and make sure none of the guests see him. I’ll hold you responsible if this leaks out.”</p> 
 <p>The attendant replied hurriedly, “I understand, I’ll see to it right away.”</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian felt his chest tighten and his breathing difficult. He took some time to calm himself down, but he still couldn’t figure out what to do. As the clan lord and a duke of the Empire, he knew things people at his level should know. Qianye’s killing of Li Fengshui was already shocking enough, and his exploits in the neutral lands had spread throughout the upper echelons of the Empire. There were also rumors that Elder Wei of the military never returned from the neutral lands because of Qianye.</p> 
 <p>What gave Song Zhongnian the biggest headache was that Qianye had unclear relationships with many powerhouses in the Empire, even characters like the Pointer Monarch. For some reason, Empress Li was also quite interested in the neutral lands these days. The Song clan had to be especially careful under such circumstances, and it could even be said that they could neither talk about nor touch Qianye.</p> 
 <p>Additionally, Qianye himself was not easy to push around—he had gained fame in the bloody battle for battling people above his rank. His cultivation had advanced at such an unbelievable pace that even the Pointer Monarch felt that he had the potential to reach the apex and touch the dao. How could the Song clan easily offend such a person? Those who had offended him would surely lose sleep one day if Qianye were to reach the apex, or even just touch the edges.</p> 
 <p>Qianye had already declared his vampire identity to the world. Now that he was at the gates of the Song clan, letting him in would make things difficult to explain.</p> 
 <p>Song Zhongnian couldn’t help but hate Qianye for not being dependable. He did switch the letters of his name, but he didn’t even put on a disguise! Besides, what was the difference between Qianye and Ye Qian?</p> 
 <p>It was too late to debate these matters. It was unlikely that Song Zhongnian would be able to cover up this news entirely. Considering the clan’s leaky condition, many people would know about it before long. Many people at the assembly would take this opportunity to cause trouble for him.</p> 
 <p>Just as he was distressed over what to do, the old steward said, “Master, this man has always been good friends with the seventh young master. Why not let him handle it?”</p> 
 <p>These words woke Song Zhongnian from his reverie. “Very good! Let’s do it that way.”</p> 
 <p>The old steward swiftly returned to the funeral hall and conveyed the message to Song Zining. The latter’s expression became complicated, seemingly touched and angry in equal measures. He shook his head, saying, “This fellow sows chaos wherever he goes.”</p>
