 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the voice of the six-armed creature from the forest. Although the voice transmitted through the consciousness was rather blurry, that feeling of extreme anger and agony left Qianye with a deep impression. He immediately recognized the owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was also able to pinpoint the source of the sound as well. The beast before him was still transforming rapidly, almost as though something was struggling within. The gap left behind from the slash was being pushed open as the entity inside made ready to rush out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whatever it was inside the beast, Qianye wasn’t going to let it climb out so easily. He grabbed East Peak with both hands and made a beeline for the underside of the beast, stabbing into its belly from below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he immediately realized something was off and pulled back as soon as the blade sank in. One of the beast's rear hooves flew at Qianye, sending him flying hundreds of meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Caroline’s Thunderous Whip arrived like a poisonous dragon, lashing at the beast’s wounds with fire and electricity. The creature howled in pain as the elements crept into the defect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following a loud scream, the beast’s body snapped into two, and a six-armed creature crawled out from within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body was bloody, mangled, and skinless, a mournful and disgusting sight to see. Caroline was startled, but Qianye recognized this being as the six-armed creature he had run into within the forest. Most of his body was already turning to stone back then. His skin crumbled off after Qianye forced it to leave the stone chair, and it still hadn’t recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once exposed to the air, the creature’s flesh began to steam and bubble, leaking a disgusting yellow liquid. It was almost as though the being had been splashed with strong acid. Apparently, the environment outside of the forest was extremely toxic to this creature. Qianye finally understood why this creature had stopped chasing him at the edge of the forest, but he would’ve never expected the being to arrive in the body of another beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Qianye had used up his two Shots of Inception, and his stamina was more or less spent. Despite that, he produced Heartgrave and took aim at the six-armed creature. The latter clearly remembered this gun—he let out an angry roar while moving sideways like a demon, hoping to evade the muzzle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the creature seemed to have forgotten about Caroline. The Thunderous Whip arrived silently and wrapped itself around the creature, erupting in an unprecedented burst of electricity and flames. The green lightning stretched all over the six-armed entity’s body, burning all of his flesh without mercy. The attack practically roasted him alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Screaming hysterically, the six-armed creature grabbed the whip and tugged hard upon it. He actually tore Caroline’s Thunderous Whip into several pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a muffled grunt, Caroline went pale and spat out a mouthful of blood. She staggered back several steps before managing to stabilize herself. It would seem she had been injured quite badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite that, her attack struck the enemy’s weakest point. The six-armed creature had lost its skin, let alone defenses, so it definitely wasn’t having a good time. The creature staggered toward Caroline but collapsed after a few steps, never to move again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye arrived beside Caroline and helped her up. “How are you faring?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Caroline smiled weakly. “It’s not so bad, just a bit injured. I’ll be fine after a day of rest. Is that old thing dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can it not be after taking a full hit from you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has nothing to do with me. I just aggravated his injuries. In the end, he died to your Shot of Inception.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t wrong. Qianye’s Shot of Inception attacked the source of one’s life. It could be suppressed temporarily, but there was no way to remove it. The six-armed creature was heavily injured after taking two shots before Caroline stepped in to whip him. The suppressed injuries erupted all of a sudden, leading to his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint crackling sounds came from the six-armed creature’s body as a grey hue extended all over him. His blood and flesh were turning into stone. Qianye picked up the six-armed creature’s beast host, while Caroline took charge of the corpse. The duo then headed back to base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye immediately sent the remains back to Fort Continent for Song Hui’s team to study. At the same time, he ordered them to send Zhao Jundu a sample as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the information he had at hand, the six-armed creatures were highly intelligent commanders of the beast army. Studying them might yield the key to this new world. Qianye now had a solid foundation on Fort Continent and ample infrastructure, including research facilities, but he was far from comparable to the Empire’s research institute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing that the dark races had entered the new world in advance, Qianye had no intention of withholding information. He was willing to share what he knew with the Empire, but he had the say in who to share it with. Zhao Jundu was fine, but no one else should even think about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dealing with the six-armed creature’s corpse, Qianye formed two forward units under Caroline and himself. These two units would each head for the two forests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They still didn’t know what other resources were in the woods, but the tree sap there would serve as a substitute for beast blood, allowing people to adapt to the environment of the new world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first forest wasn’t very big. The six-armed creature within had been killed, and Qianye hadn’t sensed any other powerful enemy in it. Hence, Caroline was tasked with heading to that location. The second forest boasted three Holy Trees, and although the six-armed creature there was dead, there were still a lot of beast eggs there. There was also an unknown number of beasts hibernating therein, so Qianye decided to go there himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After preparations were complete, Qianye set out at the helm of a motorcade made up of several dozen trucks. They arrived in the forest after half a day of travel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, the forest was filled with an aura of savagery. The roars of alien beasts could be heard from time to time, as well as sounds of them fighting amongst each other. It would seem that the loss of the six-armed creature had reduced the beast army to mere beasts that could only act out of instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye raised his hand, signaling the convoy to stop a thousand meters away from the forest and spread out. The soldiers carried armor plates down from the trucks and quickly constructed a temporary line of defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye entered the forest alone after the base was completed. He had just stepped into the forest zone when he was attacked several times. After the death of their commander, these beasts had turned into real wild animals that could only live according to instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After continuing a while longer toward the center, Qianye calculated the distance and unleashed his origin power. The flames of Venus Dawn were as dazzling as the sun, alarming half the forest in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether this was considered a provocation or a threat to the beasts, the entire forest was now aboil with countless animals charging at Qianye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Qianye was surprised by how effective this taunt was. However, he wasn’t here to try and kill beasts on his own today. He immediately turned back and fled out of the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tidal wave of beasts surged out from the forest and charged at Qianye’s temporary base. Qianye’s soldiers were ready for the incoming enemies. They dared not save bullets under the present circumstances and used their greatest speed to pour ammunition down on the enemy. Several high-speed cannons fired constantly, forming a network of flames that would reap the enemy’s lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beast tide was half gone before it could even reach the defensive line. Qianye raised his sword and stepped forward, ready to use his domain and Life Plunder. However, he felt someone hugging him by the waist before he could even take the first step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eiseka stopped him, saying, “Sire, how can we let you fight personally? You just watch us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, Eiseka turned back and shouted, “What are you all dazed for!? Charge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dozens of werewolf chiefs and shamans were the first to jump out of the defensive line, charging loudly at the enemy horde. Two thousand werewolf soldiers followed from behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the two armies rammed into one another. This was a great opportunity to prove the werewolves’ bravery and strength. The tall frame of the werewolf chiefs slammed into one beast after the other, sending the smaller ones flying into the air. The shamans, on the other hand, used all kinds of strange techniques or strafed the enemy with origin hand cannons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The werewolf soldiers at the back were much simpler. They charged into the enemy horde and began doing what they did best—a melee brawl. Some went berserk during the battle, throwing away their weapons and shields in favor of claws and teeth.</span></p>

You stay here and oversee the battle, don’t come over!” Eiseka then charged into the battlefield like a wisp of smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once in the field, he adopted his true combat stance and plowed his way into the horde of beasts. The path was filled with bloody rain, all the way until he reached the heart of the swarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye shook his head. Looking back, he was flabbergasted when he saw that the hundreds of soldiers behind him were fighting like there was no tomorrow. These werewolves fought with no care for their lives, choosing to fight at melee range despite possessing other forms of advanced firepower. This went out of hand after Qianye equipped them with armor and war-axes. Now, they were intent on charging at the forefront for close-quarters clashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye actually knew that Eiseka and the werewolves were trying to stop him from unleashing the Venus Dawn domain and Life Plunder. They were even more afraid that Qianye would let Zhuji out. This combination would easily wipe out everything within a hundred meters—draining their vitality, charring their skin, and basically making them inedible. Little Zhuji was even worse. Not only did she make the enemy remains inedible, but the entire area would also turn into a forbidden zone. Anyone entering it would die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the werewolves adopted this kind of tactic out of habit. They would do anything for food.</span></p>
