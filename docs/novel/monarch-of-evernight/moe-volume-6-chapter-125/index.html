 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone at the scene trembled at the thought. Releasing these two Storm Pearls would definitely cause a huge wave. They would surely be able to attract countless experts, but whether or not the Li clan could control the ensuing chaos was a different matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone brought up the subject again after a fair moment of silence. “At first, we needed two more years to collect the rare ingredients for this batch of Storm Pearls. It was only because of His Majesty’s need that the imperial warehouse supplied us with them.” He paused for a while and said in a probing manner, “Eldest Brother, I also heard that this was on Lin Xitang’s advice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi shot him a glance. “Yes, the Storm Pearls are involved in the changes to the floating continent. But it's enough that you know, do not speak of it. Lin Xitang doesn’t need to use such a material object to deal with our Li family. Don’t overthink things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person was still doubtful. “The War of National Fate isn’t looking good. Since Lin Xitang was injured during the battle at Giant’s Repose, could it be that his divination arts aren’t accurate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one responded to these words. Everyone had different thoughts reflected on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi’s bearing was calm and unperturbed. “This man, Lin Xitang, you can dislike him all you want, but you can never underestimate him. Moreover, battles have always been influenced by timing, numbers, factional fortune, and the influence of peak characters. Be it Evernight or Great Qin, who would dare speak of being accurate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person opened his mouth but downed a cup of tea after realizing that he had no words to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a pause, Li Tianshi continued, “Even if there are no changes to the floating continent, what does our Li family have to lose? The Storm Pearl can increase the rank of any cultivator below the divine champion level by one. Just this effect alone is enough to make people covetous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone sighed in dissatisfaction. “But we spent so much effort on them. Are we going to give it away just like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If two Storm Pearls can get us the Misty Wood, then it’s not a loss. This is the key to our upgrade to a major clan.” As someone leading armies, Li Cunjian was fairly clear to this fact. Soon afterward, he sneered, “Even if those outsiders can obtain such a treasure, they would need to be alive to use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone suddenly realized something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi said, “It’s settled then. Oh right, call back Little Nine and give him a new identity and name. Have him go to the floating continent to contest for contributions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Call Qingyun back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi nodded. “Yes, his talents are inferior, and his hopes of becoming a divine champion are slim. He might be able to take that last step with the help of the Storm Pearl. I can’t openly favor him, but giving him such an opportunity is justified. With this fortune and future luck, he might just be able to cross over that threshold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone glanced at each other and nodded slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">High-ranking aristocratic families had the ability to restrain divine champions, but in order to upgrade to a true major clan, they would need a real divine champion to hold the fort. The Li family had already made preparations for this. But things aren’t constant among the aristocracy—the danger of falling down in times of weakness was always looming over the horizon. With the Song clan’s awkward situation serving as an example, everyone knew that there was no such thing as too many opportunities for their scions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi’s arrangement of hitting many birds with one stone was naturally good. It was just that snatching food from a pack of wolves wasn’t that easy. Even after success, the path to becoming a divine champion was long and hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingyun was, since his youth, intelligent and loved martial arts. He would learn and master every technique almost instantly. His temperament was brutal, his killing intent was strong, and his attacks, always unrestrained. At the same time, he was even a bit stronger than Li Kuanglan. His weakness, however, was his inferior talents, and even the Li clan couldn’t find a secret medicine capable of transforming him completely. Hence, his case had always been considered a matter of regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi scanned everyone, and after seeing no objections, he said, “Then everything is settled. Start spreading the news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s expressions turned serious as they affirmed the instructions. They knew that a storm would ensue before long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi remained motionless after everyone had left. Only when a man in his forties entered the courtyard did he stand up and bring him into the study.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within that elegantly decorated room, there was a person arranging a chessboard on his own. The man was clad in simple clothing and appeared to be in his twenties at a glance. Upon careful observation, however, one would find that he wasn’t as young as he seemed on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi greeted, “Brother-in-law.” He then turned toward his follower. “All the intelligence has been gathered, yes? Report directly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The follower opened the document folder in his hand and said, “There’s been progress in all of the matters Elder Rui has instructed us to investigate.” As the matter wasn’t too complicated and the follower was also a talented individual, the report was delivered clearly in just a short while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This means Lin Xitang has indeed left the imperial capital during the battle at Giant’s Repose.” Li Rui’s eyes fell upon the chessboard as he calmly placed another piece. “He went to the Greensun Manor yesterday? How bold. What is the marquis’ opinion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi sat formally and looked down at his hands on his knee. “It’s improper for us to cause any more disturbances during the war of national fate. The waves around the floating continent will only increase.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui laughed as he threw the two white pieces in his hand into the box. “Winds and waves aren’t a problem. How can there be a tidal wave without a storm? Never mind, leave the struggle between orthodoxies to us old fellows. You youngsters focus on expanding outward! Have you made preparations for the redistribution of military zones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi replied, “Uncle Fangqing has been transferred to the war department. With the addition of a couple of other people, our participation in the army leadership will be quite expansive. His Majesty’s imperial guards will also recruit two lieutenant generals from our family. Unfortunately, things happened too fast, and we didn’t have the time to produce any marshal candidates.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The redistribution of military zones wasn’t just about removing a couple of marshals. There would be drastic changes from the military to regional administration. General Li Fangqing was the Jingtang Li Family’s highest-ranking member in the military world. He was currently the local commander in charge of the military police. This was a position of great power, but in the end, those managing internal affairs were inferior to the generals overseeing large warzones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui said, “Our family’s roots in the army are too thin. We might not be able to obtain stable military authority even if we expose our divine champion power two years in advance. It’s great that we were able to obtain more active offices, but we must pick the right people to enter the imperial guard.” He gave it some thought and said, “I’m rather concerned about your siblings, especially Lil’ Lan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi’s calm expression suddenly shifted, and his brows couldn’t help but knit together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui looked up at his expression and said, “Even you don’t know how Lil’ Lan became related to those two little fellows?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi smiled wryly. “Little sister probably met Zhao Jundu while exploring the central cave in Giant’s Repose. Song Zining, on the other hand, has always been moving with the main army, and he had remained in Prince Greensun’s command center later on. If she had really gone to the Zhang clan’s camp… there’s no way we wouldn’t know that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui also revealed a helpless expression. “She’s really been spoiled!” That was what he said, but one could hardly hear any blame in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi’s smile turned even more rueful. Their little sister was a child their father had gotten at an old age and had thus received much of the elders’ affection. All the siblings, including Empress Li, had pampered her like they would, a daughter. However, she had always been cold and detached despite her intelligence and great talents, eventually growing up to become such a person. They truly had no one else to blame for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this matter was simply too delicate—it was fine if nothing happened, but it would be difficult to handle once something came up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lil’ Lan is causing too much trouble this time. You’d better keep an eye on her,” said Li Rui. “We can ignore Song Zining, but that Zhao Jundu is a different matter. He’s the son of the eldest Princess, someone younger by an entire generation. Moreover, during the fight for orthodoxies back then, Duke Xuanyuan, Zhao Xuanyun, supported the Eastern Tranquility Tower in contending with us, causing both sides to suffer. This led to that nobody Lin Xitang’s meteoric rise. The orthodoxy is our Li clan’s foundation. There’s no reconciliation between us and the Zhao clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi’s expression froze. He hadn’t expected Li Rui to take a child’s mischief so seriously. He gave it some thought before asking, “I heard that the alliance the elders were trying to form with Prince Greensun didn’t go very well. What happened after that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui frowned upon hearing this. “His Excellency Zhang refuses to comment. He neither agrees nor refuses. I’ll discuss this matter with the empress when I visit the imperial capital this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi lowered his gaze in contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Rui stood up and said, “I’ll set out tonight.” He didn’t leave via the main doors but went into the bedroom instead. There, he moved a hanging flower pot, and following which, the bookcase moved away to reveal a dark passage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before going in, Li Rui suddenly turned back and said, “Marquis, you’re a man of great skill and strategy, one most fitting to lead our family to power. But sometimes, you shouldn’t act on emotions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi sat in place for a long while. The aide beside him also remained seated as straight as a pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhi Jie, is Lil’ Lan still in isolated cultivation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it has been said that the Young Miss has gained some insights on the path to combat perfection. This time, she’s going to remain in isolation until she fully comprehends that Hidden Snow Stance.” Presently, most of the family servants only knew that the clan lord had a young brother. This aide knew because he was the son of Li Tianshi’s wet nurse and had been following him since a young age. He could hardly change his address after all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi asked again, “What exactly is Marshal Lin’s situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The follower replied, “There were rumors a while ago about him being injured during the divination of Giant’s Repose, but that’s false information released by the Northern Manor. There really is something wrong with his body, but the situation is unclear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi nodded and dismissed the aide. He sat there for quite a while after the aide left before walking over to the window, his gaze traversing all obstructions to land on the mountain and sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Jingtan Li Clan’s divination art was an ancient inheritance comparable to the long history of the four major clans. Despite being set back quite badly during the battle of orthodoxies back then, the clan remained a colossal entity and was an honored guest to many an imperial clan member and nobility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, every entity had its strengths and weaknesses. The Li clan’s overall strength had always been lingering around the top tier of the aristocratic families. They were still a fair distance away from upgrading to the status of a major clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the two factions had been fighting constantly, the empire had been internally peaceful for quite some time, so it wasn’t that easy for the Li family to pioneer new territory. If they were to follow normal procedures, the family would hardly be able to take that next step in Li Tianshi’s entire lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Tianshi laughed all of a sudden. A flame flickered in his eyes as he muttered to himself, “Those with influence but no power will always rely on others. How can I allow myself to be restrained so? War of national fate? Heh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spread of news in the empire was both fast and slow. Usually, it would take months for things at the border to reach the imperial capital, but big news would spread throughout the major clans in a single day. Before a single day had passed, the Storm Pearl’s appearance on the Li clan ranking awards had reached the desks of every clan lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous undercurrents started flowing immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye, who was on the distant floating continent, had no idea what this so-called Storm Pearl was. Even if he did, he wouldn’t pay too much attention to it. This Storm Pearl could upgrade one’s talent potential below the divine champion rank, but it was useless for Qianye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He cultivated the Song Clan Ancient Scroll which was poles apart from the orthodox principles—there wasn’t any bottleneck to speak of. The only thing he needed to do was maintain the balance until the two parts had reached the apex and then proceed to explore the primal chaos realm mentioned in the outlines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Additionally, what Qianye wanted from this war weren’t resources but purely contribution points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Qianye was paying rapt attention as he opened the Book of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the thick cover was a familiar list of contents. The same words were written upon it: Refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The table of contents flipped over in response to Qianye’s consciousness. There, the mass of rolling darkness turned into human figures demonstrating swordplay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye was beyond familiar with this move. It was one of his killing moves—Nirvanic Rend. However, the Nirvanic Rend at this moment was no longer the same as before. It had become much clearer, and there was a sharp sword intent rushing at his face. This meant that the move had been further perfected, and its might had grown significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qianye seemed to have understood something and tried flipping the page over. As expected, a new page had appeared after Nirvanic Rend. There was also a sword-wielding figure here, holding the blade with both hands and dealing one strike in each of the eight directions around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This move was much simpler compared to Nirvanic Rend. However, the concept of the blade wasn’t normal. It was simple and unadorned yet dignified. Every blow possessed a might capable of splitting the skies and parting the oceans. That suppressive pressure rushing out at his face caused Qianye to feel stifled!</span></p>
