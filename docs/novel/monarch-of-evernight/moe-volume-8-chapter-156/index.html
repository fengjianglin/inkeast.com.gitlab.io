 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining observed everyone’s expressions. “Does this mean that everyone here wants an explanation from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if you’re famous, you can’t ignore all of the nobility like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining gave everyone a nod and made ready to speak. The crowd thus quieted down in anticipation of what he was about to say. Who would’ve thought his signature smile would turn into a frosty grin? He roared, “I’m just looking out for my brother, what can you do to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words exceeded everyone’s expectations. Who would’ve thought the usually civilized and elegant seventh young noble would shed all pretenses and throw out such undisguised words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t just speaking his mind; it was a fearless provocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lu family elder shot to his feet, pointing at Song Zining with a trembling finger. “Such insolence from a brat! You can forget about getting any peace if you don’t give our Lu family an explanation today. My nephew’s life cannot be wasted!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining shot a glance at the old man and then turned toward the crowd. “So the lives of your scions are worth a lot but Qianye’s isn’t? Everyone sitting here should know how well you performed in the fight for the holy mountain. Humph, you cower when it’s time to fight but yap your tongues when fighting for quotas. I have no plan to outtalk you people, and there’s no need to waste useless words since I’ll do exactly what I want. Do you think a bunch of cowardly trash like you is worthy of any explanation from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lu elder was livid. “What insolence! What insolence! The Song clan did such a poor job raising you that I really wish I could teach you a lesson in their place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining sneered. “You want to teach me a lesson? Very well. Three days later when I’m completely recovered, I’ll be waiting outside of the city for a fight to the death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lu elder was shocked. He pointed at Song Zining but had nothing to say except for uttering “Y-You… you...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining didn’t wait for him to speak. “Don’t tell me Elder Lu wants to take advantage of my injuries and fight me to the death now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder was startled, seemingly having his thoughts seen through. Although his cultivation was higher than Song Zining’s, the Lu family was just a low-ranking aristocratic family. They simply couldn’t compare to a massive entity like the Song in terms of gear and secret arts. These two factors would close the gap between them by a fair bit. In addition, the recent battles proved that this batch of young imperial geniuses was dauntless in the face of death—truly terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Song Zining were to step into the arena three days later, fully healed, the one walking out alive might not be Elder Lu. He was very clear about this fact, as were the people around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But with how clear Song Zining had phrased it, the elder simply couldn’t bring himself to say it. Besides, It would be useless even if he did—the opponent wasn’t that dumb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, Elder Lu and Song Zining fell into a situation where they would have to fight to the death. This wasn’t what he initially intended. Now, however, he would lose all face and never be able to stand tall for years to come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people nearby became tense and quickly stepped in to mediate. “That wasn’t what Elder Lu meant, please don’t handle matters emotionally. It’s not wise to fight internally during these troubled times. The Lu family has just lost one of their main talents, so we should discuss how we can compensate them reasonably.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people chimed in after hearing these words. Elder Lu took the opportunity to resume his seat and extricate himself from this difficult position. Everyone’s eyes fell on Song Zining, their thoughts fairly evident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining wasn’t about to hold back. He opened his folding fan, saying, “What you’re all saying is that you want quotas for the second batch, right? It’s best if I give up my own quota as well or move myself to the last.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s smiles became awkward. “There’s no need to go so far, we’ll feel bad if that happens. Haha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining’s smile disappeared. “This young master will not give up my quota, nor will I change the sequence. Whoever wants my quota can stand, let me get acquainted with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was astounded. Someone said with a forced smile, “What does the seventh young noble mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining laughed. “You people never gave it your all during the showdown, but you’re quite extreme when fighting for the spoils! Whoever wants my quota should stand up and say it. Forget about forcing me to give it up or distributing it in secret. Let me tell you the truth, I’m a very vengeful person who knows no magnanimity. Whoever wants to be my enemy should kill me in a couple of years. Otherwise, this young master will eliminate you all by the third year, even if you’re a low-ranking aristocratic family!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Lu was livid and restless in his seat. He had used his family name to threaten Song Zining, so the latter was sure to eliminate them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing no one responding, Song Zining pointed at the sky and said casually, “Even if you're determined to do that, it’s useless. Let me tell you that I have people above me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that Song Zining did not share an amicable relationship with the Song clan, but they also remembered that the Song clan ancestor favored him the most. Currently, the clan was thinking of a way to make him return. They probably wouldn’t just stand by if something were to happen to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from that, Song Zining was notoriously well-connected in every field. Many major characters in the empire had unclear relationships with him, and there was no telling who was from which faction. Unless they could get rid of him secretly without leaking any clues, what awaited them might be a wave of thunderous wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the thought of this, everyone’s smiles turned stiff as most of them were mid to lower aristocracy. Those at the top-tier had already sent their people in. These families had only banded together to make Song Zining lower his head. If they really were to go head to head with him, there was no telling whether or not they could withstand Song Zining’s future retaliation. What was certain, however, was that they couldn’t afford to suffer the wrath of a true powerhouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that they couldn’t suppress Song Zining, people started looking toward the imperial clan representative. They were hoping he could do something about the seventh young master’s arrogance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eunuch Zhang knew it was time for him to step out. He let out a dry cough and said calmly, “This matter stems from you, seventh young noble. This opportunity in the Great Maelstrom isn’t really a necessity for you, either, so why not end things on a happy note by shifting the order of entry. If you’re willing to do that, we’re willing to listen to whatever demands you may have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone listened attentively. The quota to enter the Great Maelstrom was too important to them. A success here would give their families a chance to take a step upward, so who would be willing to give up? Eunuch Zhang’s suggestion intended for both parties to take a step back. Song Zining would free up his quota and everyone else would compensate him for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was able to accept this. Riches and fortunes could be accumulated, but their families would have no hope of progress without talents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining seemed to know what everyone was thinking. “Fine, I have only one demand. Investigate Yun Zhong and Yun Hai’s background to their roots.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eunuch Zhang’s expression shifted slightly. “Isn’t this matter clear enough yet? They have been punished by Eunuch Liu for going against their orders and cowering in the face of battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? What a pity, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eunuch Zhang sat straight with a serious expression. “I can agree to it If you really must investigate, but only to the extent of my power. I can’t decide how far I can go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let it be if you can’t decide. Otherwise, everyone will be unhappy if you cannot come to a conclusion. At that point, I’ll have to talk to the person above me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eunuch Zhang’s countenance became unnatural. He leaned forward and asked in a probing manner, “May I ask who this person is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining smiled spuriously. “I don’t dare to utter their name, neither will you want to hear it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eunuch Zhang sighed. “Since that’s the case, it looks like I can’t help with this matter. Farewell!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, the eunuch rose from his seat and left with the imperial clan in tow. Now, only the people from the aristocracy were left behind. Top aristocratic families like the Li had long since sent their people into the tunnel, so none of them were present. The group here had gathered in hopes that the imperial clan would support them. Who would’ve thought Eunuch Zhang would leave immediately after Song Zining suggested the investigation of Yun Zhong and Yun Hai’s origins? The man simply left, having no intention of wading into these muddy waters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pushed the minor aristocratic families into the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Zining scanned everyone with a smile and said word by word, “I insist on looking after my brothers, what can you do to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments later, the entire group left—dejected, silent, and gloomy. They discovered that they simply couldn’t do anything to Song Zining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for taking it out on Qianye, there was no need to even think about it. Even the number one expert of the imperial palace had taken action to save him, at the risk of being killed by the Throne of Blood. Even without this level of connection, Qianye’s current strength was already quite terrifying. How could these small families handle him if he were to improve once again in the Great Maelstrom?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if these people didn’t understand during the battle of the holy mountain, everyone should’ve figured out later that it was Qianye’s three Shots of Inception that had truly injured Luo Bingfeng. The last shot, especially, was earth-shattering in its power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who could or would dare to take such a blow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, they would rather target Song Zining than a god of death like Qianye. At least, this seventh young master was better known for his scheming. Such types would rarely shed all pretenses, and it was more likely to reach a compromise. If it was Qianye in his place, there might be a Shot of Inception flying over immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that no one had imagined that the seventh young master would turn so entirely hostile. He would rather step into a life and death arena than yield. Was this because he was peeved or was he planning to seek revenge for the families crowding out Qianye?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had an answer to this. Only the words “I insist on looking after my brothers, what can you do to me?” echoed in their ears.</span></p>
