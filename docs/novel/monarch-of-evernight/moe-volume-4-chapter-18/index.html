 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were undecipherable patterns and runespeak symbols carved upon the door. Streams of light still flickered across the symbols although the door had been left unopened for an unknown length of time. This signified that the origin array was still operational.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A certain vampire viscount walked up and observed the door in detail. He then returned to the squad and said respectfully to the expressionless demonkin, “Great Master Maris, I’ve checked and found no other arrays in the vicinity. Only the seal on the door itself is still operational.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The down-curved edges of Maris’ mouth shifted slightly as he emitted a nasal “mm”. This was considered a reply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The viscount was only a step away from being addressed as a sire, but in the eyes of this Master Maris, he wasn’t even worth speaking to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maris took a slow step forward but his figure suddenly became blurry—the next moment, he had already appeared mid-air before the giant doors. He hovered there silently observing the runespeak symbols and patterns on the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No origin power fluctuation could be sensed during this whole process. Even in his current levitational state, it seemed as if he was standing on an invisible platform instead of using origin power. The vampire viscounts gazed at Maris with reverence in their eyes. Even the count was wearing a rather reluctant expression which barely disguised his profound apprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maris studied the door for quite some time before he exhaled deeply and lamented, “The work of a master! This is the work of a great master! Sadieson, my friend, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did the other elderly demonkin speak slowly, “If we hadn’t obtained the opening method in advance, it would likely take a couple hundred years to open this gate with our ability. Legends stated that Andruil was a grandmaster of runespeak and origin arrays. It seems they’re not false.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of vampires were relieved and revealed delighted expressions. It was unknown how old these demonkin were, but they were both masters of runespeak and arrays. They had likely served the Evernight Council for more years than the ancestors of everyone else here had lived. Receiving such an affirmation from them meant that the operation this time had already half succeeded—they had found the correct place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, Andruil was a vampire monarch. The fortunes he had left behind would benefit the vampire race the most. Perhaps all the vampires from the evernight camp would rise in strength once the Black-Winged Monarch’s treasure comes into being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sadieson walked toward a certain vampire lady and, erasing the arrogance on his countenance, spoke respectfully, “You Majesty Nighteye, it’s up to you at this point. Your bloodline is the only key to opening this great door.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye removed her hood at this moment—her remarkably beautiful face was the very picture of perfection, a countenance free from all blemish. If one must find a flaw, it was that her expression was too cold and her demeanor too proud. She seemed to hold everyone around her in contempt. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This vague arrogance was also an inherent majesty. However, no dark race member was discontent. Their society was extremely strict with regards to the hierarchy founded upon bloodline and strength. Someone of higher rank could kill someone of lower-rank with little to no repercussions, given that he possessed overwhelming strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many of the weaker vampires immediately lowered their heads as Nighteye removed her hood and dared not look upon her features. Even the viscounts dared not gaze at her for too long. Even so, they felt their heartbeats hastening and the blood energy within their hearts almost going out of control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While restraining her aura, there wasn’t the slightest bit of origin power fluctuation around her. It was as if she was a fledgling vampire who couldn’t yet leave her superiors’ side. Even now, her strength was merely rank nine and had yet to reach the level requirement for a viscount. However, even the vampire count couldn’t help but take a step back and edge away when she released her aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vampires only sensed the suppressive might stemming from the primogenitor bloodline. In Sadieson’s eyes, however, there was a formless energy field proliferating constantly around Nighteye with some drifting runespeak symbols flickering on and off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two demonkin masters both revealed expressions of admiration upon seeing the powerful runespeak array. This was a top-grade bloodline power which could be rated as a perfect prototype. She was able to utilize runespeak power instinctively even before the champion level. This was something many champions would fail to do in a lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence to Maris and Sadieson, Nighteye wasn’t just a young vampire lady who hadn’t yet crossed the champion threshold but was a princess who would ultimately sit with Evernight Council in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the veneration every race from the evernight camp possessed toward bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye advanced and arrived before the bronze doors. She then rose into the air to stand beside Maris.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before her was a great eye carved upon the bronze door, comprised of incomparably complex arrays. The tens of thousands of array lines each contained power. This had already been personally witnessed by the vampires in the squad. The vampires below the viscount level had observed the eye for mere moments before they began to grow dizzy and some even fell to the ground. At this moment, no one apart from the count dared look straight into the giant oculus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye’s pupils gradually turned from blood color to gold. The wisp of golden radiance transformed continuously, seemingly materializing into a complex condensation. If anyone here possessed a magnifying eye ability, he would clearly find that there were countless golden strands twisting together repeatedly. They were actually duplicating the array within the giant eye one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maris was finally moved—he was completely unable to disguise his astonishment and profound envy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one’s bloodline and innate gift—the root of darkness had always been unfair. Some existences arrived in this world with incomparable power and were destined to trample all living beings underfoot. However, it was such injustice that made the dark race citizens revere and seek providence with all their heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the origin array in her eyes had formed completely, Nighteye extended her left hand and used her nails to cut across her palm. Blood immediately gushed out like a spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye muttered some words in ancient runespeak, each of her words containing tremendous energy. She actually had no grasp of the meanings behind them, but the string of runespeak words had suddenly appeared in her head after successfully copying the origin power array on the bronze door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the command to open the giant bronze doors. Beyond these doors was their objective, something they had been seeking all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye slowly faced the bronze door and pressed her bloodstained left hand on the giant pupil. Countless strands of blood immediately spread along the origin array patterns and gradually extended over the whole eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As fresh blood flowed out continuously from Nighteye’s hand, her face became increasingly pale and her aura rapidly weakened. She suddenly fell from mid-air and collapsed to the ground after failing to stabilize herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The door seemed to come alive as the network of sanguineous lines covered the whole of the giant eye. The lustrous eye seemed as if it was about to start moving, and indeed all of a sudden, the eye blinked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within moments, all of them felt as if the eye was staring at them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, such a bizarre scene delighted the two demonkin instead. Sadieson stopped the vampire count who wanted to rush forward to support Nighteye and continued to wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t need to wait too long before the giant eye shattered and transformed into countless irregular blood colored fragments which dispersed in every direction along the origin power patterns. The giant door began to shake and rumble before slowly collapsing backwards, finally revealing the world within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was vast space behind the doors, hundreds of meters from floor to roof, and supported by gigantic stone pillars that could hardly be encircled by a dozen or so grown men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a deep ravine just beyond the door. Glancing down, one could see water flowing at the bottom of the abyss and emitting a bluish luster. The more powerful vampires would feel even greater terror while gazing at this river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The falling bronze door just happened to fall across this deep ravine and formed a natural bridge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nighteye slowly got up at this time, her aura weakened significantly. The vampire count hurriedly ran over and presented two translucent and sparkling pieces of ruby-like top grade blood crystals. Nighteye directly swallowed one of them before color gradually returned to her pale face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint mist suffused the area beyond the abyss. It didn’t appear very thick, but nothing could be seen through it. Everything from the bridge formed of the giant bronze door to the high vault seemed to vanish from everyone’s senses as soon as they reached the other side of the abyss—even the two demonkin’s senses were being blocked—only Nighteye’s pupils were able to see through the mist unobstructed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She pointed toward the distance and said, “There’s a city over there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maris was both delighted and surprised as he cried out somewhat excessively, “Could it be the legendary Heaven’s Chosen City!?”</span></p>

Sadieson’s cheeks twitched after hearing these words, but in the end, he ground his teeth and bowed toward Nighteye. “Your Majesty, I had no intention to offend you. I only hoped to inform His Majesty Slaughterblade as quickly as possible and have him come over. After all, Great Monarch Andruil was exceedingly powerful and the defenses deployed by him might not be something we can break through on our own.”</span></p>

 <p>Hi everyone, it's Legion here. &nbsp;We've finished setting up the in-house sponsorships and will be posting advance chapters on both sides for a week or two while we make the transition. Advance chapter functionality will stop on patreon after the transition is done ^_^ I'm also happy to announce that the advance chapters will increase in the in-house sponsorship system after we conclude this transition phase. Cheers ^_^ Thanks everyone for the support. I'll continue to work hard to live up to everyone's expectations.</p>
 <p>And about teasers... WW has an auto-teaser system in place at the moment. If you guys still want the old image/gif teasers, we could probably put them in the TL thoughts, but then we might want to remove the "previous teaser", otherwise the whole TL thoughts section will be super bloated. I'm not sure how to work on it yet. What are your thoughts? I'll try experimenting a bit this week.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>This is regular 2/6 of the week. (1/3 milestone bonus delivered. 2 remaining.)</p>
