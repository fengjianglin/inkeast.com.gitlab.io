 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian finally realized something he had been puzzled over all this time—why Lin Xitang had been acting more extreme in recent days, why he had been implementing new policies, and why even the Imperial Party was often attacking him. Marshal Lin’s political enemies didn’t include just the cabinet which he presided over, but also the nobility who had always been wrestling with the Imperial clan for power. There were also those old powers who had somehow recovered from their past decline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shadowy surname emerged in Zhang Boqian’s mind. “The Jingtang Li Clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor wasn’t surprised that Zhang Boqian would mention the Li family. “None of the old ones should be left behind. They stick to their old ways and are willing to be used by the Longevity Monarch. They’re so unscrupulous that I would say that they’re obsessed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are the young ones your people?” Zhang Boqian noticed the hidden meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The divination families had always been sparse in familial relationships and camaraderie. The Li family runs itself like a sect, so before the trajectory of the heavenly path, all family members become expendable. That’s quite a disastrous mindset. Some of them wanted to turn the clan back into an ordinary family, and I have no reason to disagree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s tone suddenly turned to a sneer. “It seems Lin Xitang doesn’t know much about the Li family. Your method of separating them is quite well planned.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal Lin has always adhered to the path of a minister and avoided the Imperial family matters of his own accord. I told him not to get involved with the heir issue, and he listened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian recalled how the heir selection had caused a huge ruckus in the Imperial palace. Back then, Lin Xitang had left for the Western Continent to subdue the rebels. “Your Majesty is indeed far-sighted. Your subject hopes you can get your domestic affairs settled quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I manage to get to the end, can Monarch Zhang come to the Hidden Palace with me as a witness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Zhang Boqian replied in a straightforward manner, completely ignoring his position as a heavenly monarch from outside the family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Emperor was also a bit surprised. “Marshal Lin cannot use divination inside the Divination Pavilion, but similarly, other prophets and divination specialists cannot touch him, either. I suggest you let him stay there for now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Xitang…” Zhang Boqian didn’t continue. “I’ll stay here for now. Call me whenever you need me.” His voice hadn’t even trailed off when his figure had vanished from the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhang Boqian appeared in the Divination Pavilion once more, Lin Xitang’s first words were, “Is His Majesty confronting the Longevity Monarch?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without his divination powers, Lin Xitang was as wise as ever. He could already figure out the situation just from how Zhang Boqian and the Emperor had appeared together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian suddenly recalled that Lin Xitang’s plans were always watertight and far-sighted, but it wasn't impossible to botch up with bad execution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, the battle on the void continent had been going on for some time now and might even be reaching its end. There was no more room for gradual changes. Unfortunately, Lin Xitang couldn’t step out of the pavilion in his current state. The ripples in the heavenly mysteries born of the new world and the return of the Sacred Mountain supreme was enough to take his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian’s hands tightened subconsciously behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His own way of leading troops was extremely fierce. Every battle would see great accomplishments, but the casualty ratio often drew criticism. Sacrifice had never been a reason for him to avoid battles, but that thin origin array in his hand felt rather heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xitang didn’t press the question after seeing Zhang Boqian silent. “Did you meet Crown Prince Habsburg?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There wasn’t much to say between us during the fight, but how did he get into the divination pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A high-dimensional projection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that the power of a crown prince?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s the only vampire crown prince in a thousand years. The Empire doesn’t have any information about his powers,” Lin Xitang said. “This person is highly dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian couldn’t help but become serious when he heard Lin Xitang’s evaluation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Habsburg is the son of the Sorceress of Fire, Anita. His paternal lineage is unclear, but he was already a duke by the time he returned to the clan. The ancient blood pond also recognized his identity, freeing him of all suspicions. The man took only eight years to seize the clan lord’s position, becoming the youngest ever grand duke and the faction’s number one genius in a hundred years. Only thirty years has passed, but he has once again broken through to become a crown prince. Such progress is rarely heard of even in our human race, let alone the dark races.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said pensively, “You launched two major operations against the Evernight Council leaders during the Iron Curtain. Was that to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. You see, everyone’s ignoring the abnormalities surrounding that person. The two hundred years before his return was completely blank, and the attention he has been receiving is not befitting of his genius title. His existence was enough to break the power balance in many areas, but there was no movement in the Evernight Council or the vampire race. Especially Medanzo, everyone knows how narrow-minded the Lightless Monarch is, but there has been no news at all about any conflict between the two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian laughed while looking at the marshal. “Lin Xitang, I’m a crude man who knows nothing about the direction of this world. You don’t need to beat around the bush to warn me of the dangers outside. I know Habsburg lured me to the capital and I have my own calculations, but… nevermind. Let me get Gu Tuohai to take a look at your situation first, otherwise, what can you even do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t even finished speaking when the sound of the ascending elevator echoed through the hall and a plump old man walked out from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian said, “Looks like His Highness is the one who understands you the most.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Tuohai’s appearance had to be an Imperial summon; there was no other possibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing these clueless words, Gu Tuohai agreed without knowing what everything was about. “Producing so many secret treasures in one go, you deserve to be trapped here. You might’ve helped those clan descendants, but there’s no telling if they’ll thank you for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He went forward and placed a hand on Lin Xitang’s wrist. Moments later, his expression relaxed and he revealed a smile. “Your condition is good, you’ll be rid of the accumulated medicinal poison in a couple more days. Staying here for a month is worth it, I say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious that Gu Tuohai was in a good mood. “I must say, though, His Majesty did really well. This is the only way to deal with someone like you! Although I was shocked until my heart was beating regularly. Which charlatan gave you so many white-fruits? What a waste!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xitang muttered, “Recently? The medicine from before…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” Gu Tuohai looked at him cautiously. “You can’t move right now because medicine is spreading throughout your body. Things will be just right after you lie another three or four days. But if you take that medicine without waiting for the previous poison to disperse, then maybe you should start taking poison directly next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xitang smiled. “I won’t. I don’t need to go against the heavenly mysteries now, so I can focus on self-preservation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Tuohai said after a moment of astonishment, “Now that you don’t need to endure the backlash, you seem to be trying to endure poison instead! The little emperor is so cautious that he won’t let me receive any information. Do you think he’ll let me smuggle drugs in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He glanced at Zhang Boqian and, in his anger, forgot just how scary the latter was. “I don’t have that ability, you should ask Prince Greensun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian looked back at Gu Tuohai, sending a piercing chill down his spine. An undefiable and cold voice said, “Get out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Zhang Boqian clenched the fist he had behind his back, completely destroying the origin array in his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An angry Gu Tuohai left with a swing of his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian looked at Lin Xitang for a while. “Do you want me to do this for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression was calm, and those perpetually stern eyes looked exceedingly profound at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xitang said after some hesitation, “Boqian…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian cut him short, “All this time, I’ve always felt that you seeking death was your business. Now, you want me to personally send you to your grave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xitang didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian shook his head. “Lin Xitang, I know your eerie powers, so there’s no need to explain further. Just answer yes or no.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although that was what he said, Zhang Boqian didn’t really wait for a reply. He pushed open the tall window and jumped out immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Tuohai was still standing in the small plaza in front of the Divination Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing Zhang Boqian approach, he said in a scoundrelly manner, “When I told you that the forbidden technique might cut it, that was a lie. There’s no way Lin Xitang will dare let anyone see his true situation. Some people are trying to cause problems where there is none, and this time is no different. Lin Xitang had just suffered a great loss in strength after producing secret treasures for the Great Maelstrom, but these people want him to lead all his troops into battle. It seems they want to exhaust him to death because they can’t kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian didn’t act out. “One cycle of sixty years, that’s an ordinary person’s life, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sixty years my ass!” Gu Tuohai began to spew profanities. “He’ll live one cycle only if there’s no other sickness. The way he’s going about things, I’m finding it strange that he’s still breathing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Flaming Crown once said that Lin Xitang was using the darkness origin flames to cancel out the backlash. How did he do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even he himself has no idea. That’s an unknown principle of darkness and daybreak balance, and there’s no way to recreate it. The only possibility is that Lin Xitang was in a minor world when he was injured, and the laws that make up the balance are different.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next up, Gu Tuohai said directly, “Don’t even think about it, a person’s lifespan isn’t something that can be extended. Even if the Flaming Crown becomes a great dark monarch and his origin blood can block all external damage for Lin Xitang, it won’t be able to extend his lifespan by a single second. The same goes for your daybreak grand source, it’s useless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian laughed mockingly. “Lin Xitang once said that heavenly monarchs don’t dare to die. How can someone like him, who’s not even a heavenly monarch, judge whether or not I dare?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Tuohai sighed deeply. He had calmed down a bit after all the venting. “Marshal Lin’s words don’t make for good listening material, you’ll die of anger.” After a pause, he said, “This fellow likes to make all living things worry about him, and he likes to trick his own people! How good would it be if I had stayed behind on the Evernight continent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Boqian glanced at the scenery of the Imperial capital, his expression silent and lonesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The streets were bustling with activity—some were happy, some worried, some hurried, and others carefree. However, this prosperous world was as fragile as a piece of ice on fire. Everything would fall apart with just one eruption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly was a heavenly monarch? Were they afraid of death like the Longevity Monarch or only mindful of virtuous causes like Pointer and Profundity Monarchs? What was the meaning of life apart from pain, hatred, and blame?</span></p>
