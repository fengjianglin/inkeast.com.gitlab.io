 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang instinctively used her hands to cover her eyes.</p> 
 <p>But, in the next moment, she opened a small gap between her fingers and peeked at Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>She secretly thought that his figure was comparable to a model’s.</p> 
 <p>This time, the sight that greeted her eyes wasn’t the view of his back, but rather…</p> 
 <p>“If you want to look, just do it openly. It’s not like you’ve never seen it before,” Shen Zhining said jokingly. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s face turned as red as a tomato. Since she was outed, she stopped trying to hide her gaze. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining picked up a set of sleeping robes and put it on. It was clearly just an ordinary set, but after he put it on, it looked particularly suggestive. </p> 
 <p>“You should have said something if you wanted to change. Don’t tell me you act like this in front of others?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining still hadn’t put on his belt, when he heard her words. He walked over to her and whispered in her ears, “Do you think you are just another person to me?”</p> 
 <p>“I…” Sheng Jiaoyang originally wanted to say she was, but she remembered that they were currently dating. </p> 
 <p>She couldn’t help but keep glancing down. He wore his robes very loosely, and his chiseled body was definitely exposed. Even if people didn’t want to look, their eyes would still be drawn to his muscles. <em>He’s clearly trying to entice her!</em></p> 
 <p>“Hurry and put on your clothes properly, don’t catch a cold,” Sheng Jiaoyang said in a righteous manner. </p> 
 <p>Although she sounded very justified, the way her eyes wandered all over his body revealed her true thoughts. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining slowly adjusted and tightened his robes, and when he saw the disappointment in her eyes, he couldn’t hold back his laughter anymore.</p> 
 <p>His laughter brought Sheng Jiaoyang out of her dreamland, and she quickly turned away and refused to look at him again. With her back turned to him, she changed the topic, “I came here to ask if Sven would be able to find out that Lina is here. If he does, what do we do?”</p> 
 <p>“If he comes…” Shen Zhining intentionally paused and waited for Sheng Jiaoyang to turn around and look at him before he continued, “Then he can get the hell out.” </p> 
 <p>“You make it sound like a piece of cake. He’s not that weak.” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him doubtfully. </p> 
 <p>“You don’t believe me?” Shen Zhining spoke gloomily, and he approached her, a dangerous light flashing in his eyes. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang coughed lightly and rapidly drew back while giving him a fawning smile. “Who else would I believe but you?”</p> 
 <p>“Then, why are you hiding?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m not hiding—ah!” She was suddenly pulled into Shen Zhining’s embrace.</p> 
 <p>At such a close distance, the fresh scent of his shower gel became stronger. Together with the hormones that filled the air, it formed an intoxicating scent that made her whole face turn red, like she was drunk. </p> 
 <p>She pushed him away, before she said in a quiet voice, “If you want to speak, speak properly. Behave yourself, keep your hands or legs to yourself.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I won’t use my hands or legs then.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had just released a sigh of relief, when she suddenly saw that his face was right in front of hers. Then, before she could react, she found that her lips were locked with his. </p> 
 <p>He didn’t use his hands or his legs… he only used his mouth. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining used action to show her what he wanted. </p> 
 <p>Since he was embracing her waist, she could only lean her upper body back. However, for every inch that she leaned back, he would lean forward. If she moved back one inch, he would move one inch forward. Two inches, and he would move two inches. Soon, she was leaning back so far that she was 30 degrees from her original position. Shen Zhining decided to stop playing around, and he simply pulled her in and moved forward, before directly pushing her onto the bed. </p> 
 <p>“Mm…”</p> 
 <p>Initially, Sheng Jiaoyang still tried to struggle, but the other party knew her body’s weak points far too well. Her body turned to jelly under his touch, and she was unable to resist him. </p> 
 <p>However, when he started to strip her clothes, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly snapped out of her daze. </p> 
 <p>“Wait, wait a moment.” Sheng Jiaoyang pressed down on Shen Zhining’s hand. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining gently sucked on her ear. Although his hands were still pressed under hers, his fingers were still moving, and Sheng Jiaoyang almost couldn’t help but burst out in laughter from how ticklish it felt. </p> 
 <p>“You’ve already made me wait for a long time.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang instantly understood and suddenly felt herself burn up with restlessness. </p> 
 <p>“You have to wait until my memory returns.”</p> 
 <p>He licked her ear. The earlobe was originally a very sensitive place, and this act caused Sheng Jiaoyang to shiver. </p> 
 <p>“What if I don’t want to wait?” he whispered into her ear. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed him away, but when she made contact with his warm and strong body, she couldn’t help but give him a few more rubs. However, this movement was like pouring oil on a fire, and it almost made him explode. </p> 
 <p>The hand that was being pressed down suddenly came to life. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sensed what was going to happen and in her anxious state, she blurted out, “I haven’t showered yet!”</p> 
 <p>He halted. </p> 
 <p>A proud light flashed through Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes. <em>This would definitely be unbearable for such a mysophobic person.</em> </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining got up and looked down at her. He noticed the proud look in her eyes, and his lips curved up into a smile. Just as she started to relax, he suddenly picked her up. </p> 
 <p>“Wh-what are you doing?” Sheng Jiaoyang hooked her arms around his neck in surprise. </p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say you haven’t showered yet? I’ll help you wash up.”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was already left dumbstruck. </p> 
 <p>When he set her down, she finally recovered from her daze, and she saw that she was already in the bathroom. She turned around, and was just about to run out, but she was easily pulled back in. The shower turned on and warm water came pouring down, leaving her drenched.</p> 
 <p>She narrowed her eyes at him. “You…”</p> 
 <p>She had barely spoken when she was pushed onto the wall and fiercely kissed.</p> 
 <p>The kiss was so long and passionate that she almost couldn’t breathe. At this moment, a scene suddenly flashed through her head. </p> 
 <p>Bathroom, shower, a lingering silhouette. </p> 
 <p>For a moment, a strong feeling of déjà vu overwhelmed her, and she stopped resisting him.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Lina had just finished her bath, and when she came out of the bathroom, she saw that Sheng Jiaoyang was no longer in the room. However, she didn’t bother trying to find her, and instead just laid on the bed. But instead of going to sleep, she laid there and cradled her stomach with a complicated mood.</p> 
 <p>When she first learnt that she was pregnant, she absolutely would’ve gone right to the hospital to get an abortion. However, she no longer knew if she would do so now. </p> 
 <p>After taking a few days to calm down, she had thought a lot about what this child meant for her. </p> 
 <p>She thought for a very long time. It was already early morning, but she still had too many things in her mind. After finally thinking things through, she took out her phone. </p> 
 <p>Just as she turned on her phone, somebody called. </p> 
 <p>It was Sven. </p> 
 <p>She stared at his name on her screen. However, she didn’t hang up on him, and actually picked up his call instead. </p> 
 <p>“… Lina?” The other side evidently also didn’t think that she would pick up. </p> 
 <p>Lina smirked and said calmly, “If you still want me to give birth to our child, don’t disturb my life anymore.” </p> 
 <p>After a period of silence, Sven finally said, “Darling, turn on your camera, let me see you.” </p> 
 <p>Lina thought about it and agreed. </p> 
 <p>She leaned on the headboard. The lamp wasn’t very bright, so her video quality wasn’t very clear. However, her expression could still be seen. </p> 
 <p>Lina faced Sven with an unprecedentedly calm and serene expression. She already thought it through. There were still too many things waiting for her to do, and she didn’t want to waste time being tangled up with Sven. </p> 
 <p>Rather than running and hiding from him, it was better to make things clear. </p>
