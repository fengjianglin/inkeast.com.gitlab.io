 <hr>
 <p>George couldn't wait to make out with Lina the moment they reached home.</p>
 <p>When Lina saw how eager he was, she knew that the past few days must’ve been suffocating for him. Thus, she decided to postpone the chat with him.</p>
 <p>When George was about to enter her, Lina suddenly flinched. Unlike the previous times they did it, she did not feel the satisfaction of being in perfect harmony and having George in her embrace this time round. Moreover, she was unexpectedly distracted by random thoughts while being intimate with George.</p>
 <p>George naturally felt her absent-mindedness. When the deed was done, he wrapped his arm around Lina and kissed the corner of her lips. Since her lips were scarred, he didn’t dare to kiss her for fear of hurting her.</p>
 <p>"You must be tired, right? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have rushed it. It’s just that I haven't touched you for too long, so I couldn’t help myself…"</p>
 <p>Lina reached out to caress George's lips. "You don't have to apologise to me. I should be the one apologising instead…I was a bit distracted earlier."</p>
 <p>"Alright, both of us don’t need to apologise. Honey, I know you're really tired, so you should sleep and take a good rest. Let’s go to sleep."</p>
 <p>Lina’s lips parted, but no words came out. She wanted to say the words stored in her heart, but now, she was not able to say anything.</p>
 <p><em>Alright, I’ll tell him everything when we get up in the morning.</em></p>
 <p>After the long flight, she was really tired. As soon as she closed her eyes, she fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>She woke up the next day, only to find that the spot beside her was empty. She got up, put on a nightgown, and walked out of the bedroom. She found that breakfast was already prepared on the table, along with a note. She walked over and picked up the note. <em>Honey, something happened at the company, so I'm going there to check on the situation. Remember to eat breakfast.</em></p>
 <p>When her eyes landed on the breakfast on the table, she felt moved. But at the same time, there was an inexplicable feeling of emptiness in her heart.</p>
 <p>She then went to the bathroom and washed up before proceeding to the dining table. She sat down and was about to eat her breakfast when she heard the sound of the door opening.</p>
 <p>Her eyes instantly lit up. She quickly got up and jogged over, "George…"</p>
 <p>When she saw the person at the door, she immediately halted, and her expression changed drastically.</p>
 <p>"How did you get in here?"</p>
 <p>Sven smiled, "Darling, if I want to come in, do you think a door can stop me?"</p>
 <p>Lina felt the flames of anger rise in her heart when she realized her private territory had been invaded.</p>
 <p><em>This bastard is too much! How could he come all the way to my house?! If George suddenly comes back…</em></p>
 <p>With just one glance, Sven understood her concern. "Your George is too preoccupied with the troublesome matters at his company, so he won’t be able to come back for the time being."</p>
 <p>"What have you done this time?" Lina angrily asked.</p>
 <p>Sven approached her and replied, "I didn't do anything, but now I'm planning to do something."</p>
 <p>Lina turned around and ran. She wanted to run back to her room and lock the door.</p>
 <p>She wouldn’t let herself be threatened by Sven again now that she’d decided to come clean with George. <em>I shouldn’t get involved with this bastard anymore.</em></p>
 <p>However, how could she possibly outrun a man? By the time she ran into her room and was about to close the door, Sven’s hands were already pressed against the door.</p>
 <p>"You want to play hide-and-seek with me today?" Sven's eyes were fixed on Lina. It was as if his gaze was locked on his prey, and certainty and confidence exuded from him.</p>
 <p>"Sven, you're trespassing on someone else’s private property. This is against the law!" Lina let go of the door and slowly retreated.</p>
 <p>"How can this be regarded as trespassing on private property? After all, you were the one who gave me the key."</p>
 <p>"That’s bullsh*t. How can I possibly give you the key?!"</p>
 <p>Sven smiled, "If I say that you’re the one who gave me the key, then you’re the one who gave it to me. Others won't believe you even if you deny it. Don't forget, we've already rolled in the sheets before, more than once. Do you think people will still believe you if you say that you were forced to do so?"</p>
 <p>Lina was rendered speechless. She hastily scanned the room to find something to defend herself with. However, Sven had already walked over before she found anything.</p>
 <p>"Sven, I'm begging you. Could you please stop pestering me?" Lina was forced into the corner and had no choice but to lower herself to beg him.</p>
 <p>"No, I can’t." Sven straightforwardly refused her.</p>
 <p>His gaze landed on Lina's collarbone and travelled down the slightly open neckline of her nightgown. His gaze deepened when he saw some ambiguous traces and a dark glint flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>Lina closed her eyes for a second before staring at him straight in the eye with her head slightly raised in a stubborn manner. "Are you trying to hound me to death?"</p>
 <p>Sven reached out the back of his hand and gently caressed her cheek. His fingers slid down to her neckline and gently circled around the marks on her body. Then, he pressed close to her and whispered, "If you die, I'll let the person you cherished the most accompany you."</p>
 <p>"For example…George." Lina’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>"Or…the girl named Xu Jiaojiao." Her complexion turned deathly pale at his words.</p>
 <p>Sven grinned at the sight. His smile resembled that of the most wicked devil in the abyss. He untied the belt of her nightgown and stroked her smooth skin before softly whispering, "What a surprise. It turns out that Xu Jiaojiao is more important than George in your heart."</p>
 <p>"Since you are so close, why should I keep her alive if you were to die? Darling, don't worry. If you commit suicide, I will send her to accompany you right away. Then, you won't be lonely in heaven."</p>
 <p>Lina slightly trembled. She wasn’t trembling out of fear. Rather, she was boiling with anger.</p>
 <p>She pushed Sven away. "You should be the one who drops dead!"</p>
 <p>She grabbed the collar of her nightgown and was about to run out.</p>
 <p>However, Sven grabbed her at the waist and threw her onto the big bed. Then, he pounced on her like a beast about to eat his prey. Lina was firmly pressed down, and her struggling hands were pinned above her head.</p>
 <p>"Get out!" Lina struggled with all her strength.</p>
 <p>But her strength was like that of a newborn kitten.</p>
 <p>Sven took off his belt with his other empty hand and untied his pants.</p>
 <p>"Don't—"</p>
 <p>He sealed her mouth with a kiss and reopened the wound on her lips as he bit down again. The taste of blood filled his mouth, but he didn’t find it nauseous. He kept sucking and licking like a vampire as he deepened the kiss.</p>
 <p>Lina moaned out with a mix of pain and some other emotion. Even she didn’t know what she was feeling at this moment.</p>
 <p>In terms of stature and physical strength, George wasn’t as strong as Sven. Nowadays, George spent most of his time at his company, and he had no time to work out at all. Although he was young, he wasn’t as sturdy as Sven.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Sven had a lot of experience in bed, and he knew how to make his partners enjoy the pleasure of unity as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>Lina was able to resist initially, but was gradually brought to that sea of pleasure. Her mind went blank. She felt like a sailboat floating on the sea, bewildered at the turbulent surging waves.</p>
 <p>After experiencing the rain, the sky cleared up. Lina thought back to the fact that she was unexpectedly intoxicated by the earlier sensations and she spurned herself for feeling that way.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, her phone rang.</p>
 <p>Lina was startled. Just as she thought that it might be a call from George, Sven’s voice suddenly travelled to her ear.</p>
 <p>"Darling, it could be a call from your George!"</p>
 <p>Lina didn't move.</p>
 <p>Sven chuckled, "If you don’t answer, he might think that something has happened to you and he'll rush back here… Oh, I'm really looking forward to the look on his face when he sees you lying in my arms."</p>
 <p>Lina hurriedly grabbed her cell phone. When she saw that the call came from Sheng Jiaoyang, she breathed a sigh of relief. She pushed Sven aside and answered the phone.</p>
 <p>"Mei Niu, did you get home already?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked with a voice full of concern.</p>
 <p>"I'm home… Ah!" Lina hurriedly bit down on her lip and swallowed the cry of surprise.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?"</p>
 <p>Lina buried her face in the pillow and tightened her grasp on the phone as she quietly murmured, "Jiaojiao…I’m…busy…right now…I’ll…call you…back later." She stuttered and spoke with difficulty, as she tried hard to control her voice and stop it from trembling.</p>
 <p>"Okay." Sheng Jiaoyang didn't know what situation Lina was in, so she hung up after bidding her farewell.</p>
 <p>"Darling, why didn’t you chat for a bit longer?" Sven gently nibbled her earlobe and ambiguously asked.</p>
 <p>However, his movements weren’t ambiguous at all. Like a fierce tiger who was reawakened, he ravished his prey with pleasure.</p>
 <p>Lina buried her face in the pillow and desperately tried to stop herself from letting out any sounds.</p>
 <p>Sven narrowed his eyes as a trace of evil flashed past them. He suddenly moved to seize the cell phone in Lina's hand.</p>
 <p>"What are you doing?" Lina turned her head.</p>
 <p>Sven quickly found the number he was looking for and punched it in. Then, he switched the call to speaker mode and threw the phone out of Lina's reach.</p>
 <p>"Who did you call?" Lina asked, somewhat panicked.</p>
 <p>"Who do you think?" Sven asked back with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Lina felt a chill creep up in her heart when she heard George's voice.</p>
 <p>"Honey, did you miss me?" George asked.</p>
 <p><em>It is relatively quieter over there, so George must be at his office.</em></p>
 <p>Lina reached out to try and grab the phone, but she was pinned down by Sven and couldn’t reach it.</p>
 <p>Sven nibbled her ear and whispered, "If you don't speak, I will."</p>
 <p>Lina panicked. As she endured the primal response from her body, she controlled her voice and asked, "George, am I disturbing you? Don’t mind me, go ahead with your tasks~" Her words trailed off into a high pitch voice as Sven became extremely stimulated and started giving her a hard time.</p>
 <p>George didn't seem to think much about it and replied with a laugh, "No matter how busy I am, I can’t neglect my precious baby. Did you have breakfast already?"</p>
 <p>"I… Ah!" Lina firmly bit her lip.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter, Dear?" George sounded worried.</p>
 <p>Blood rushed to Lina's face, and she quickly replied in a stoic voice, "I almost slipped."</p>
 <p>Sven was acting crazier by the second, so she hurriedly added, "You hang up first, I'll call you back later."</p>
 <p>"Alright, take care of yourself. I'll pick you up later and take you out for dinner."</p>
 <p>Lina buried her face in the pillow again, as she let out a muffled moan.</p>
 <p>The sheets had already been crumpled under her hands.</p>
 <p>When George hung up, Sven happily whispered in Lina's ear, "Look, your body is the most honest. In fact, you also enjoy the feeling of carrying out a clandestine love affair."</p>
 <p>"Affair. My. Ass!"</p>
 <p>Sven bit her shoulder. He gently penetrated deeper and finally arrived at the climax.</p>
 <p>He drew Lina closer and said, "Darling, on the same bed where you made out with George, you made out with…"</p>
 <p>"Shut up!" Lina roared out angrily.</p>
 <p>Sven chuckled and happily replied, "Okay, I'll shut up."</p>
