<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Go and shower first. I’ll go and make some honey water,” Lina said to Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded as she casually flipped through Lina’s wardrobe. Then, she grabbed a pair of pajamas and a new pair of underwear before entering the bathroom. </p> 
 <p>After she’d finished showering, she found that Lina still hadn’t returned. Finding it strange, Sheng Jiaoyang went out to search for her. She was very familiar with Lina’s house, and in the past, she’d almost lived in it like her own home for a while. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s steps slowed before reaching the staircase. From there, she could see Lina sitting on the living room sofa with Aunty Lin and Lin Yan sitting across from her. What she saw next astonished her; she could actually see Lin Yu! </p> 
 <p><em>How come Lin Yu is here?</em></p> 
 <p>The sound of Sheng Jiaoyang’s footsteps attracted the attention of the people in the living room.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, come here.” Lina waved towards her. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao?” Lin Xuejun looked at her daughter doubtfully. </p> 
 <p>“Her name’s Xu Jiaojiao, my best friend.” Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang had already talked it over and decided not to reveal her true identity to avoid extra trouble. </p> 
 <p>“How come I’ve never seen her before?” </p> 
 <p>“It’s because I just met Jiaojiao the last time I went to China, where we fell at first sight-”</p> 
 <p>“Cough!” Lin Xuejun coughed lightly, reminding her, “It’s ‘felt familiar at first sight’.” </p> 
 <p>Lina shrugged. “Isn’t it pretty much the same thing?” </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun seemed helpless as she shook her head before giving Sheng Jiaoyang a warm and friendly smile. “Welcome to our home. If you need anything, just tell me or Nana.” </p> 
 <p>“Alright, Aunty Lin.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled back. </p> 
 <p>A trace of astonishment flashed through Lin Xuejun’s eyes. If it weren’t for the other’s height, features, and figure all being different, she would’ve believed that Sheng Jiaoyang had come back. She turned and glanced at Lin Yan and saw that he was also looking at Xu Jiaojiao. She didn’t say anything as she reinspected the girl sitting together with Lina, not revealing her true thoughts. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s gaze hopped between Lin Yan and Lin Yu, a strange expression on her face. </p> 
 <p><em>So they were really relatives then? They couldn’t be brothers, right?</em></p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, he’s my eldest maternal uncle’s son,” Lina answered Sheng Jiaoyang’s thoughts. </p> 
 <p>“Your eldest maternal uncle?” Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but glance at Lin Xuejun. It’s been so many years, yet she’d never heard Aunty Lin mention anything about her family. She’d always thought that Aunty Lin was an orphan. </p> 
 <p>“Hello! We meet again.” Lin Yu smiled at her.</p> 
 <p>“You guys know each other?” Lin Yan asked. </p> 
 <p>“Of course, they know each other. They’re a coup-” Lina had just started to answer when she felt herself giving away the secret and hurriedly stopped. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Lina silently. <em>Don’t screw up, no matter what!</em> </p> 
 <p>“She’s my girlfriend’s friend, so we’ve met before,” Lin Yu said. </p> 
 <p>“Xiao Yu even has a girlfriend now?” Lin Xuejun’s voice was soft. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yu nodded, his expression turning dark. “But, she got into an accident. Otherwise, I definitely would’ve brought her to see Aunty.” </p> 
 <p>Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at each other, their expressions strange. </p> 
 <p>Lina was thinking: <em>Her cousin actually liked Little Sun so much!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was thinking: <em>Luckily I got into an accident. Otherwise, wouldn’t Lin Yu have ended up falling deeper and deeper?</em></p> 
 <p>“An accident? Is it serious?” Lin Xuejun asked worriedly. </p> 
 <p>“I’m not sure, I can’t reach her.” Lin Yu shook his head, his face becoming even darker. </p> 
 <p>Suddenly, he seemed to think of something as he turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang, his voice eager as he asked, “You’re Jiaoyang’s friend, so do you know where she’s currently recovering?” </p> 
 <p>“Jiaoyang?”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaoyang?” </p> 
 <p>Two voices asked in unison. </p> 
 <p>“What?” Lin Yu felt his heart jump as he looked at his aunt and cousin. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan took a deep breath, forcing his expression to remain neutral. </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun glanced at Lin Yan before asking Lin Yu, “Is Sheng Jiaoyang your girlfriend?” </p> 
 <p>“Aunty, how did you know? Do you know Jiaoyang?” Lin Yu asked, amazed. </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun revealed a smile as she pointed at Lina. “It really is a small world. Jiaoyang was like sisters with our Lina and would often come here to play. I even consider her to be my second daughter.” </p> 
 <p>“I see! It’s no wonder that Aunty and cousin were so surprised. Then, do you know how Jiaoyang is doing right now?” Lin Yu said. </p> 
 <p><em>Of course, she knew!</em> Lina almost couldn’t prevent a smile from forming on her lips as she forced it down. “I’m also looking for her.” </p> 
 <p>Lin Yu looked at Sheng Jiaoyang again. He had no idea that it was her and just watched her shake her head, disappointment appearing on his face. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan was silent, feeling unhappy as he thought of how Jiaoyang got a boyfriend as soon as she went to China. </p> 
 <p>“We’ll be going back to our rooms to rest.” Lina stood up and tugged on Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand. </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun spoke to Lin Yu softly, “Xiao Yu, don’t feel sad. Jiaoyang is a good child, so nothing will happen to her. It’s late now, you’d best rest soon.” </p> 
 <p>“Yeah, Aunty should also sleep early!” </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun nodded before going upstairs to rest. </p> 
 <p>“Cousin, you’re not sleeping yet?” Lin Yu looked at Lin Yan. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan narrowed his eyes and suddenly asked, “When did you get together with Jiaoyang?” </p> 
 <p><em>Cousin is actually interested in this?</em> Lin Yu was confused but still answered, “We were only together for a month before her accident.” </p> 
 <p>“She…never mind. Sleep early!” Lin Yan also returned to his room. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yu watched his cousin leave. He felt that the people in his aunt’s home all skirted around the topic of Jiaoyang, but he didn’t know if it was just his imagination.</p> 
 <p>After returning to their rooms, Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang talked a bit about what had just happened before Lina went to shower. Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t feel sleepy so she went to stand on the balcony. </p> 
 <p>A little garden was set up on the balcony with flowers, hanging chairs, and a little table. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the potted plants on the ring-shaped shelf behind the hanging chair. There were all sorts of little plants, including bell cactus’ and onions. Fairy lights were wrapped around the shelves, shining on the plants. She reached over and slid her hand across a small and delicate flower pot, eyes filled with memories. </p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, I’m planning to go with Grandfather to Germany. I’m entrusting these plants to you to take care of as I don’t feel at ease leaving them with Mei Niu. If I give them to her, they’ll probably all die.”</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, I picked up an onion during my travels. I feel like it’s quite pitiful, so can you help me take care of it?” </p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, don’t you think this little bead is special? Apparently, it can help defend against radiation! I’ll give it to you!” </p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan…” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shut her eyes, suddenly worried about her good memory. </p> 
 <p>She released a sigh and sat on the chair, leaning on it as she lightly swung. </p> 
 <p>“You’re also friends with Jiaoyang?” a voice suddenly asked beside her. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around to see Lin Yan walking towards her with a glass of wine. Only now did she remember that the balcony was attached to Lin Yan’s room too. </p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
