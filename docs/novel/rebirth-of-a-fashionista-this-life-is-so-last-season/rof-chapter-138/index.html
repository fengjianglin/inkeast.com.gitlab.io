<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“I didn't think that Zhining would also do things like deceiving his relatives,” lamented Grandfather Yang after listening to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“He's a bastard! Once he has something to do, he’d throw me aside. The days I gave him massages were all in vain!”</p> 
 <p>When he saw Sheng Jiaoyang's aggrieved appearance, Grandfather Yang raised his hand and lightly tapped her nose. “Then, what are you going to do next?” </p> 
 <p>“I'm already acquainted with Grandfather, so he’s already lost his value to me. From now on, we’ll walk our own ways!” Sheng Jiaoyang's expression revealed her anger towards Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang smiled, and while stroking Sheng Jiaoyang's head, he said, “Foolish girl, can't you see it? Zhining likes you.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned pale with fright. “What? He likes me? How is that possible?!” </p> 
 <p>“I already knew that Zhining treated you differently, and you also liked to stick to him when you were young. In the past, your mother and I both felt that you’d end up together. We even joked that we’d give you to Zhining as a child bride. That year, when I came to bring you abroad, I’d initially wanted to let you stay at Aureate Manor. However, I noticed that after Brother Shen knew of your body's condition, he had a lot of apprehensions. So, I decided to bring you with me to Italy.” </p> 
 <p>“Uh…but, what does this have to do with the fact that he likes me?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked, unconvinced. </p> 
 <p>“If only you knew how much Zhining has done for you behind your back, you’d understand how much he likes you.” </p> 
 <p>“Behind…behind my back?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang found this unbelievable. <em>Sometimes, they don’t see each other for a whole year. What kind of things could he possibly do for her?</em></p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang smiled, he understood why she didn't believe him. Last time, because he’d taken many aspects into consideration, he’d never mentioned such matters. Furthermore, since Sheng Zhining's feelings were too reserved, it would be normal if Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't feel them. </p> 
 <p>“He recommended the teacher who you learned painting from. As for your art exhibition, your dream fund, you venturing into a business with Lina and so on, he participated in all of them. It’s just that you weren't aware of it. Just now, you said that Zhining found you to be his girlfriend in name, but that was because his grandfather arranged a blind date for him. Do you know why his grandfather was so anxious about his marriage?” </p> 
 <p>“Isn't it because Zhining has a bad personality, so he’s scared that no one would like him?” </p> 
 <p>“Foolish girl.” Grandfather Yang shook his head helplessly. “It's because of you!” </p> 
 <p>“Me?” Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes wide in shock. </p> 
 <p>“Because your influence on Zhining was too deep, his grandfather was scared that he couldn't walk out of it. Who would’ve thought that Zhining would still choose you in the end? Look, he didn't find anyone else, and even though he didn't know that you’re Jiaoyang, he still chose you to be his fake girlfriend. I think this is because he feels that you’re very similar to Jiaoyang.” </p> 
 <p>After hearing this from her grandfather, Sheng Jiaoyang felt enlightened. <em>Shen Zhining, Demon King Shen, actually has such deep feelings for her?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought back on the past carefully, starting from when she was selling her paintings. At that time, Shen Zhining had used one million to threaten and prevent her from using Jiaoyang's name as her signature. He’d said that she was mimicking others only to make a fool out of herself. Now that she thought about it, she could see from all this how important ‘Jiaoyang’ was in his heart. </p> 
 <p>Additionally, it was only after she’d said that she was Jiaoyang's fangirl that he let her go and didn't use any underhanded means to deal with her. </p> 
 <p>Later, he used six million to dig a pit for her. This had led her to think that she’d contended against Demon King Shen successfully, so she’d happily jumped into the pit herself and acted as a well-behaved shield for him.</p> 
 <p>It was indeed because she was like ‘Jiaoyang’ that all of this had happened. </p> 
 <p>Thinking of her grandfather's words…Shen Zhining had done many things for her in the dark, Sheng Jiaoyang didn't know how she’d face him when they met again. </p> 
 <p>“I really didn't think that he actually cared about me this much,” Sheng Jiaoyang said as she clasped her face, distressed. </p> 
 <p>“It isn't too late. Tell him that you're Sheng Jiaoyang and he’ll be ecstatic.” </p> 
 <p>“But…” Sheng Jiaoyang gazed bitterly at Grandfather Yang. “He’s not my cup of tea!” </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang became silent. </p> 
 <p>“Didn't you like him a lot when you were young?” Grandfather Yang was bewildered. </p> 
 <p>“When I was young…” Sheng Jiaoyang crooked her head as she remininsed, discovering that all she remembered was how Demon King Shen had bullied her. She couldn't remember why she’d stubbornly clung to Shen Zhining at that time. </p> 
 <p>She stuck out her tongue and said, “That was when I was little. I now prefer someone who’s gentle and considerate.” </p> 
 <p>“Then, how about An Jing? His personality is very good, and because I’d helped him before, he was willing to marry you even though you were in a coma…… ” </p> 
 <p>“Wait a minute, Grandfather, you really wanted to organise a wedding ceremony for me while I was unconscious?” Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly interrupted.</p> 
 <p>“I was thinking that before I pass away, I should find a person to care for you properly. I didn't think of Zhining because I didn’t want his grandfather to think that I wanted to drag them down even after I die. Around this time An Jing appeared, and he helped me to see through Zeng Yuan's conspiracy. I observed him for quite a period and realised that he's not bad in many aspects, especially his excellent personality. He knows gratitude and knows to repay favours. Moreover, he doesn’t have many relatives, so there won't be any pressure if he marries you.” </p> 
 <p><em>Zeng Yuan’s conspiracy? No wonder she hadn’t seen Uncle Zeng at Grandfather's side.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang didn't linger on this matter. What caught her attention was the latter part of Grandfather Yang's words. </p> 
 <p>“But, I was unconscious. How was I supposed to marry him? Grandfather, aren't you treating marriage too lightly?” </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang smiled. “In this world, money can work miracles, let alone make a marriage certificate.” </p> 
 <p>This time, it was Sheng Jiaoyang who kept silent. </p> 
 <p>“You haven't answered me yet. What do you think of An Jing?” </p> 
 <p>“Uhhh…he looks a bit…” Her appearance complex started to act up again. </p> 
 <p>“An Jing's appearance isn't bad at all, he has a refined and delicate aura. You'll feel comfortable just by looking at him.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang faintly looked at Grandfather Yang. “Grandfather, if you want him to be your grandson, then just say it. I won't oppose.” </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang raised his hand and pinched her cheek. “If you don't like him, then just say it. Why are you bringing me into this matter?” </p> 
 <p>The grandfather-and-granddaughter pair looked at each other and smiled. </p> 
 <p>“Grandfather, are you going to tell An Jing my identity?” </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang's expression turned serious, and he muttered to himself for a while before saying, “Jiaojiao, you can't publicise your current situation, I don't want anything to happen to you. The less people who know, the safer you are.” </p> 
 <p>“I understand, so I only told it to the people that I care about,” Sheng Jiaoyang said while nodding. </p> 
 <p>“It's good if it's like this. From now on…” </p> 
 <p>At this moment, the phone rang and interrupted Grandfather Yang. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took a glance at the caller's ID before saying to her grandfather, “It's my new mother.” </p> 
 <p>After answering the call, Xu Qing asked her whether she had time, saying that she wanted to bring her to visit Li Weiqi's family. </p> 
 <p>“Okay, sent the address to me and I’ll immediately go there.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hung up and explained, “I don't know how much Grandfather knows about my present family, but my new mother is a single parent and raised Xu Jiaojiao until adulthood. Now, she’s finally met a person who wants to sincerely take care of her and who doesn't mind her age and identity. With my matchmaking, they ended up together, and now they're planning to get married. Just now, my new mother called and asked me to go meet her boyfriend's family with her.” </p> 
 <p>“That's great to hear! Let’s go. Bring me along to see your new mother.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Grandfather Yang, who spared a lot of effort to sit on the wheelchair, and the rims of her eyes became teary. Her grandfather was obviously very fit before she met with an accident. It was all her fault that her grandfather's health had deteriorated this much.</p> 
 <p>“Grandfather, my current body is very healthy, so you don't have to worry about me. You have to pay attention to your health. You still have to help me take care of my kids later!” Sheng Jiaoyang intentionally said as she pushed the wheelchair. </p> 
 <p>“Then, you go and find a grandson-in-law for me first!” Grandfather Yang teased. </p> 
 <p>“Be at ease, someone like me who's loved by all will easily find you a grandson-in-law. Today, there was someone who brought flowers to school to chase me, but I rejected him because he's a cunning nouveau riche. At the very least, I should find a good filial boyfriend. Don't you agree, Grandfather?” </p> 
 <p>“Yes yes yes, our Jiaojiao definitely has to find someone who'll dote on you.” </p> 
 <p>An Jing, who’d been keeping guard at the apartment's door, saw the two people chatting and joking with each other, and surprise flashed in his eyes. He studied Grandfather Yang's expression, discovering that the sorrow between Grandfather Yang's brows had faded. His current expression was brimming with happiness. Seeing this, he felt relieved, but he was inevitably curious about Xu Jiaojiao. <em>What exactly did she say to Grandfather Yang?</em> </p> 
 <p>“An Jing, drive us to this place,” Grandfather Yang instructed. </p> 
 <p>“Okay. ” An Jing nodded and walked towards Sheng Jiaoyang. “Let me push him instead.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at him before letting go of the handles on the wheelchair. Afterwards, she walked beside the wheelchair and told Grandfather Yang about her matchmaking between Mother Xu and Li Weiqi. </p> 
 <p>An Jing didn’t interrupt and just listened to them quietly while observing her. </p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Xu Qing followed Li Weiqi and reached the location first. </p> 
 <p>It was a very unique teahouse, with a very good ambience and service. When they went in, a waiter immediately went to welcome them and lead them to the booked private room. </p> 
 <p>“Weiqi, I'm nervous.” Xu Qing held Li Weiqi's hand tightly. </p> 
 <p>Li Weiqi smiled at her and placated, “Relax, I'm here.” </p> 
 <p>“Mhmm.” Xu Qing took a deep breath. </p> 
 <p>The waiter knocked on the door, opening it for the pair when someone inside said, “Please come in.”</p> 
 <p>The sliding door slowly slid open, and a landscape painting came into view. </p> 
 <p>“You two may enter. There are one-time use slippers that have never been used before, so please change your shoes here,” the waiter said with a smile as he pointed at the shoe rack beside the door. </p> 
 <p>After changing her shoes, Xu Qing followed behind Li Weiqi, nervously bypassing the painting before she could see the situation inside. </p> 
 <p>At the tea table, there were three people sitting on cushions. A teacup was placed in front of each of them, and there were delicate pastries placed in the middle of the table. The one sitting in the centre was a mature middle-aged man, while the one sitting on the right was an expensively woman dressed with a well-maintained appearance. On the left was a young lady with heavy eye makeup. </p> 
 <p>“You’re here, come and sit,” the man in the middle said to Li Weiqi as he entered the room. </p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the three people at the table were examining Xu Qing. </p> 
 <p>“Why did Uncle find such an old lady?” the young lady complained in English. </p> 
 <p>Li Weiqi furrowed his eyebrows as he harshly said, “Lily!” </p> 
 <p>“I didn't say anything wrong, she looks even older than my mother! Won’t you feel ashamed when you bring her out with you?” </p> 
 <p>“Li Li! Don't be so rude!” the middle-aged man said. </p> 
 <p>“So what? After all, she doesn't understand.” Li Li’s mouth twitched, her face filled with disdain. </p> 
 <p>When she looked over, just as she’d expected, Xu Qing had a bewildered expression. It was evident that Xu Qing didn’t understand the words she’d said earlier. </p>
