 <p>Melodious background music echoed in the hall.</p> 
 <p>In the hall brimming with an amorous mood, a good-looking couple of about the same height were dancing slowly to the beat. Dressed in gorgeous outfits, they took turns stepping back and forth and swirling around rhythmically.</p> 
 <p>This scene looked like it came from a meticulously filmed TV series.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman faithfully caught the entirety of this beautiful scene on camera.</p> 
 <p>"We only ate that tiny bit earlier. After dancing like this, wouldn’t the food have become entirely digested by now?" Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly remarked, her comment killing off the romantic atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining placed his arms around her waist and chuckled, "How about we sneak out and eat something later?" </p> 
 <p>"I don’t really mind, but you only eat that little bit. How’s that enough?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining inched closer and whispered in her ear, "Then, will you let me eat my fill tonight?"</p> 
 <p><em>Boom!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang was mind blown. She subconsciously peered at the director, and only when she saw that the director was standing two meters away did she feel relieved.</p> 
 <p>She feigned anger coquettishly and hammered Shen Zhining's shoulder as she spoke, "Mr. Shen, please pay attention to your image!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining's eyes overflowed with a smiling expression.</p> 
 <p>After the dance, Shen Zhining said in a deadpan manner, "We ate so little in the evening, so we might as well go to bed early."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him as if he were a beast in human clothes.</p> 
 <p>The corner of Shen Zhining’s mouth curled upwards. He took her by the hand and walked upstairs.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman followed behind them for a moment before leaping to their front after a while. He noticed that the couple didn’t go back to their room, but went to visit the owner of the castle instead. They chatted with the owner for a while and got a bottle of wine from his collection before returning to their room.</p> 
 <p>After changing back into their own clothes, the two sat on the sofa by the window and slowly tasted the wine.</p> 
 <p>There was a camera installed in their room by the program team.</p> 
 <p>"I noticed that you’re adapting quite well and quickly getting used to the camera." Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Shen Zhining, who was so calm that he turned a blind eye to the camera.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining sipped the wine and unhurriedly replied, "Whether you can adapt to it quickly depends on how you view it. If you care about your image a lot and feel the need to cover up some of your shortcomings that you don’t want others to know about, then you will be very concerned about its existence, and you will feel uncomfortable about it."</p> 
 <p>"But just because some people are comfortable with it doesn't mean that they don't care about the camera’s presence," Sheng Jiaoyang retorted.</p> 
 <p>"So either you don't care, or you fake it with acting skills."</p> 
 <p><em>That makes sense.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t find anything wrong with those words.</p> 
 <p>In another room, the program staff in control of the surveillance monitor could only stare at the screen in a speechless manner.</p> 
 <p><em>Couldn’t these two talk about their love life? Why did they bring up this kind of topic?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining didn’t care about the type of topics discussed. They talked about whatever that came to mind, and it was up to the program team to decide on whether they wanted to broadcast it or not.</p> 
 <p>"I feel like I haven't had a leisurely drink like this for a long time."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang leaned against the sofa and swirled the wine glass in her hand while staring at the luster of the flowing wine with a languid expression.</p> 
 <p>"You can be this leisurely every day if you want."</p> 
 <p>"Do you want me to be a rice worm?" <span id="footnote-ref-d7a6"><a href="#footnote-d7a6">[1]</a></span></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to look at her, and found her drinking posture a very enjoyable sight. He couldn’t help but recall the last two times he saw her drunken appearance. Back then, the little drunkard had given him quite a headache, but now that he recalled those memories, he found her drunken appearance rather cute.</p> 
 <p>"What are you smiling for?" Seeing a smile tugging at Shen Zhining's lips, Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow at him.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining leaned over and placed a hand on the sofa behind her. "Being a rice worm isn’t a bad option, right? How many people out there want to be rice worms but couldn’t be one?"</p> 
 <p>"This is probably the so-called ‘one man's meat is another man's poison’."</p> 
 <p>"So, now you like acting better than painting?"</p> 
 <p>"Why are you suddenly asking me this?" Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him with a puzzled look on her face.</p> 
 <p>"Haven’t you noticed you’re spending all your thoughts and time on acting nowadays?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to answer him when a thought flashed across her mind. She pondered for a moment and tilted her head with a smile. "Are you blaming me for not having the time to accompany you?"</p> 
 <p>Looking at her smile as if she had just discovered a new world, Shen Zhining’s eyebrows arched, and with a smile in his eyes, he said, "You can say so."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her wine glass and gently clinked it against the glass in his hand. She concealed the smile tugging at her lips by taking a sip before she said, "Distance creates attraction. If we are together every day, you will get bored of me sooner or later."</p> 
 <p>"No one will get tired of the sunshine," Shen Zhining retorted.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stunned, "But I'm not the sunshine."</p> 
 <p>"You are!" Shen Zhining stared at her and added, "You are my sunshine. I wish to see you and feel your warmth every day."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was caught off guard by his words of love.</p> 
 <p>The staff in the surveillance room was instantly abused by PDA.</p> 
 <p>"This PDA is so sudden that I’m still in the process of digesting it," the staff murmured.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt that Shen Zhining was constantly refreshing the image she had of him. <em>Tsk, tsk, he says these corny words so naturally now.</em></p> 
 <p>"Where did you learn all this sweet stuff?" she curiously asked. <em>Don’t tell me that he’d read a compilation of honey words…</em></p> 
 <p>The romantic atmosphere was instantly spoiled by her question.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stared at her helplessly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt a little uneasy with him staring intently at her. Hence, she coughed and changed the subject, "You asked me whether I liked acting better now, right? I still prefer painting over everything else. Acting, modelling, and partaking in variety shows are just part of my job. I see them as a great way to enhance my work experience. Besides, I have noticed that acting has helped me understand and appreciate life better. After all, any type of art is connected to everyday life. I have reached a bottleneck in painting. If I want to make a breakthrough, I can only improve my artistic skills."</p> 
 <p>"I will support you no matter what decision you make, as long as you don’t tire yourself out," Shen Zhining said encouragingly.</p> 
 <p>"I won’t. My health is the most important, after all." Sheng Jiaoyang spontaneously clinked her glass against his and added, "You should also pay attention to your health, and not overwork yourself."</p> 
 <p>After drinking, the two took a shower one after the other.</p> 
 <p>Before turning off the lights, Sheng Jiaoyang waved to the camera and said, "We're going to sleep now. You should rest early too. Good night~"</p> 
 <p>She put out all the lights including the wall lamp, and the room went completely dark.</p> 
 <p>Lying in bed, Sheng Jiaoyang asked, "When you think of the camera in our room, will you be able to fall asleep?"</p> 
 <p>"Yup. With you here, there are no issues." He then wrapped his arms around her.</p> 
 <p>"Are you excited now that you’re going to appear on TV?"</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm."</p> 
 <p>"You can feel excited too?"</p> 
 <p>"I’m also a human being."</p> 
 <p>"I didn't think that there was anything that interests you."</p> 
 <p>"There is."</p> 
 <p>"What?"</p> 
 <p>"You."</p> 
 <p>The man in the surveillance room was already numb from their PDA. Originally, he couldn't see anything in the dark with the lights out, and he thought that the PDA abuse was over. Never did he expect them to say another round of sweet nothings before they went to bed.</p> 
 <p><em>Should he be glad that the program team only invited these two as guests for one episode instead of the entire show?</em></p> 
 <p>The next day, all four couples gathered back in the hall.</p> 
 <p>The director said, "Before you get to enjoy your breakfast, you’ll have to play a game first."</p> 
 <p>"As expected! Based on the usual way the program team does things, I already knew that they wouldn’t let us eat without doing anything." The other three couples didn’t look surprised at all.</p> 
 <p>"Director, I'm so hungry now that I don't have the strength to play games," Sheng Jiaoyang said deliberately.</p> 
 <p>When everyone thought of the tiny croissant Team Super Tall ate last night, they couldn’t help but laugh.</p> 
 <p>The director also had a smile on his face as he said, "Don't worry, you don't have to expend a lot of effort. It's the same old rules. We will ask a few questions to test the level of tacit understanding between each team. Afterwards, we will determine how lavish your breakfast is according to the results."</p> 
 <p>"A test of tacit understanding again?!" Yao Yao pouted.</p> 
 <p>Liu Qian glanced at Yao Yao and said, "Yao Yao, you don't have to worry. In any case, there’s another team to cushion yours."</p> 
 <p>Everyone simultaneously turned to Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining, the meaning behind their gazes obvious.</p> 
 <p>"…" Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>The director held back a smile and said, "The game we are playing today is slightly different. Please get ready."</p> 
 <p>Then four couples were divided into two groups. All the men were grouped together in one group, and all the women were put in another. Each group went to a different room.</p> 
 <p>This time, the groups were assigned different topics that they had to answer. </p> 
 <p>For the men’s group, their first topic was: <em>There were ten pictures of women’s lips wearing lipstick of the same colour. Their task was to find out which one of them belonged to their girlfriends.</em></p> 
 <p>The first topic for the women’s group was: <em>There were ten pictures of male hands, and they were asked to find the hand that belonged to their boyfriends.</em></p> 
 <p>These topics were exceptional. Today's topics were obviously an upgraded version of yesterday’s.</p> 
 <p><em>Who would stare at someone’s body parts and engrave it deeply in their mind nowadays?</em></p> 
 <p>When the males saw the pictures of the lips that looked almost identical, the expression of three of the males instantly turned dull. Man Zi then howled in grief, "How can we choose from amongst these pictures? They all look the same! Why didn’t you let us choose from their eyes instead? After applying colour to their lips, it’s truly too hard to tell them apart!"</p> 
 <p>"Director, you are really cruel. It seems that you’re not just corrupt, but super corrupted behind the scenes." Peng Jiang shook his head and sighed.</p> 
 <p>Deng Renlong then commented, "I’m suddenly very curious. I wonder whether the girls can recognize our hands."</p> 
 <p>While the three of them were talking, Shen Zhining stepped forward and pasted the small sticker on his hand on one of the pictures.</p> 
 <p>"Wow, Bro! You’ve already figured it out so quickly?!" Peng Jiang exclaimed in surprise.</p> 
 <p>The other two also cast Shen Zhining an astonished look.</p> 
 <p>"Are you sure about your choice?" The director was also surprised at his speed, so he asked one more time to confirm.</p> 
 <p>"I’m sure," Shen Zhining calmly responded.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the girls were also facing similar difficulties.</p> 
 <p>The right hand of these ten men were all photoshopped, so they couldn’t determine their answer by looking at the skin colour or the blemishes on their hand. They could only judge by the shape of the hand.</p> 
 <p>"My mind is completely blank now. I can't remember what my husband's hand looks like," Liu Qian sighed.</p> 
 <p>"Same here," Yang Zichu added.</p> 
 <p>"My Longlong has thicker knuckles," Yao Yao said while examining the ten pictures. She discovered that at least three of the hands had thicker knuckles.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang was also looking at the ten pictures. After examining them carefully, she picked one.</p> 
 <p>"You already picked one so quickly?" Liu Qian looked at her with a surprised look in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm," Sheng Jiaoyang gave a smile.</p> 
 <p>"What did you base your decision on?" Yang Zichu asked curiously.</p> 
 <p>"All I know is that his hands are very good-looking, so I chose the best-looking one," Sheng Jiaoyang casually answered.</p> 
 <p>"…" The other three perspired from embarrassment.</p>
