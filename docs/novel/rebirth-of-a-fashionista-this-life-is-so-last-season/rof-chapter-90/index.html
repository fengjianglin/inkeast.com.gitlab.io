<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Ning, I’m planning to leave tomorrow. How about you join me for a drink downstairs?” Daisy appeared in Shen Zhining’s room wearing a sexy nightgown with a tulle shawl draped over her shoulders.</p> 
 <p>“It’s very late now; you should go back and rest early,” Shen Zhining indifferently replied.</p> 
 <p>Daisy stared at Shen Zhining with a dejected look and slightly twisted her body as she coquettishly said, “This may be the last time we see each other. Can’t you make an exception for me?”</p> 
 <p>If another man were to face this beautiful woman in this kind of scenario, they would have yielded to her already, but Shen Zhining was different. Otherwise, Grandfather Shen wouldn’t have to put so much effort in finding a wifey candidate for him. In the end, Shen Zhining didn’t give Daisy any face and remained indifferent.</p> 
 <p>“Aww, Daisy, you’re really leaving?” said a voice behind Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Daisy narrowed her eyes. <em>This damned girl! Can’t she read the situation?!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was all smiles as she stood next to Shen Zhining. “You want to have a drink? I can accompany you!”</p> 
 <p>Daisy was speechless.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining thought that Sheng Jiaoyang was looking after him and started to view her in a new light. What he didn’t know was that Sheng Jiaoyang, the little drunkard, was simply itching to drink alcohol.</p> 
 <p>Even Daisy didn’t know how she ended up drinking with her love rival downstairs. <em>She must’ve been out of her mind earlier!</em></p> 
 <p>The two went from having a one-sided competition at the beginning to becoming drunk together.</p> 
 <p>Daisy stared at Sheng Jiaoyang with an intoxicated, hazy look, and raised her wine glass as she stated, “How can Ning possibly fancy a woman like you with no figure and no looks?!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s because he’s blind!” Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly closed in on Daisy and raised her chin with one hand. “Look at this beauty’s charming face, and these breasts…tsk tsk!” As she spoke, she reached out one hand and patted Daisy’s chest.</p> 
 <p>Felix, who’d been dutifully pouring wine for the two of them, saw this scene from the corner of his eye and shuddered for a second. <em>Miss Xu is truly bold and unrestrained!</em></p> 
 <p>Daisy stood up, raised the glass in her hand, and shouted, “That’s right, he must be blind! Someone as beautiful as me has pursuers lined up all the way to Geneva. Who doesn’t like a beauty like me?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang propped up her chin and stared at Daisy with a big smile, her eyes narrowed to crescents. She was already drunk and had completely forgotten that the woman in front of her was someone she disliked, thinking that they were drinking buddies.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Shen and Fu Lailin were unable to sleep due to the ruckus. They came out of their room and saw the two drunkards downstairs, one shouting, and the other one giggling. Seeing that the two intended to continue drinking, Grandfather Shen hurriedly instructed Felix to bring Shen Zhining downstairs.</p> 
 <p>“Take your girlfriend with you upstairs and rest early,” Grandfather Shen pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang and said to Shen Zhining, who was walking down.</p> 
 <p>As for Daisy, he called Lilith to help her back to her room.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang staggered while being dragged away by Shen Zhining. When she saw that they were going upstairs, she hugged the newel post and pouted, not wanting to leave.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wanted to leave her here, but Grandfather Shen and Fu Lailin were still watching. He furrowed his brows and walked forth, picking Sheng Jiaoyang up in a princess carry.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhh!” Sheng Jiaoyang let out a small cry of surprise and tightly clasped the collar of Shen Zhining’s pajamas.</p> 
 <p>Watching the two’s departing figures, Fu Lailin sighed and said to her husband, “Looks like A’Ning has learned to dote on someone.”</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Shen nodded with approval; his gaze filled with heart-warming emotions. He’d been observing this girl named Xu Jiaojiao for two days and noticed that she was indeed different from what he’d imagined. He’d initially thought that since that girl’s family was poor and she grew up in a single-parent family, she must be a weak girl with an inferiority complex. But, this lass was downright different. She was very cheerful and had the temperament of a young miss from an affluent family. Her character was very similar to that of his good friend’s granddaughter, so it was no wonder that his grandson would like her. If this girl could make his grandson more approachable, he wouldn’t mind accepting her as his granddaughter-in-law.</p> 
 <p>However, the way things turned out were different from what Grandfather Shen had imagined. As soon as Shen Zhining entered the room, he immediately threw the little drunkard in his arms on the ground and walked to the bathroom to take another shower.</p> 
 <p>Woosh! The sliding door of the bathroom was pushed open.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining was in the middle of taking a shower, while Sheng Jiaoyang stood by the doorway with narrowed eyes as their gazes met.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining was speechless. He felt as if the veins on his forehead were about to burst. He quickly turned off the water and reached out to grab a bath towel. After wrapping himself in it, he suppressed a bit of his anger and yelled, “Get out!”</p> 
 <p>For a nearsighted drunkard, other people’s roars were meaningless and drifted away like floating clouds. On the contrary, his voice drew her attention and she staggered inside without halting. In the end, she bumped into Shen Zhining, her forehead almost hitting his nose.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang squinted her eyes as she stole a few glances at Shen Zhining. Then, she started giggling like an innocent little girl.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining really wanted to throw her out at the moment.</p> 
 <p>However, before he could do anything, the little drunkard in front of him suddenly placed her hands on his chest and leaned on him, accidentally pushing him against the wall.</p> 
 <p>From a bird’s-eye view, it looked like an angry young man was pushed against the wall by a short-haired girl. The short-haired girl leaned her head very close to his as she stared at him. Her right hand was placed on the wall right above the young man’s ear. She was obviously shorter than him, but it looked like she’d locked him in her embrace.</p> 
 <p>“Shoot!” Her tone was solemn as she asked, “Were you sent by Demon King Shen to seduce me?”</p> 
 <p>“…” Shen Zhining was dumbfounded and thought that he’d misheard her.</p> 
 <p>“Hurry up and answer! Yes or no?” The little drunkard courageously lifted Shen Zhining’s chin, and the smell of alcohol caressed his face as she continued, “Go back and tell him…it’s useless even if he sends you here. My heart won’t be shaken!”</p> 
 <p>“Who’s Demon King Shen?” Shen Zhining raised an eyebrow at her.</p> 
 <p>The little drunkard stepped back and shouted, “Demon King Shen is a jerk!”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s eyelid jumped and he decided to throw the little drunkard out anyway. However, he hadn’t yet done anything when the little drunkard collided into him once again, the impact causing him to let out a stifled groan.</p> 
 <p>The little drunkard held his face with her hands and knitted an eyebrow as she smilingly said, “A handsome man like you shouldn’t follow Demon King Shen. You won’t have a bright future if you do that. You should follow me! This sister will treat you well and make sure you’re well off. Come on, first a chuuuu~”</p> 
 <p>Seeing the fast approaching pouty red lips, Shen Zhining immediately detained the little drunkard’s hands and pulled her under the shower head. Afterwards, he turned the tap on to the max level, letting the pouring water drench her from top to bottom. He didn’t let her go, no matter how much she struggled.</p> 
 <p>Gradually, Sheng Jiaoyang no longer struggled and she looked slightly more sober. Seeing this, Shen Zhining finally let go of her. <em>It seems that the easiest way to deal with drunkards is to do things in an oversimplified and crude manner!</em></p> 
 <p>Through the curtain of water, Sheng Jiaoyang saw Shen Zhining standing in front of her with only a bath towel wrapped around his waist. This sight left her with an expression that was particularly beyond description. She even thought that she was hallucinating, so she raised her hand and rubbed her eyes before squinting them to take another look. Yet, what came into sight was still the image of Shen Zhining standing in front of her.</p> 
 <p><em>O-OMG! What happened here?!</em></p> 
 <p>“Sober now?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her mouth, but she didn’t know what to say. <em>Wait, is she supposed to scream in this kind of situation?? Eagerly waiting for an answer online, it’s an emergency!</em></p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
