 <p>"How's the baby?" </p> 
 <p>"Everything's normal."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang winked at Lina. Lina took a glance at the man interacting with the doctor before flashing a smile back at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>After they left the hospital, Lina told Sven that she wanted to go shopping with Sheng Jiaoyang and told him to figure out his own activities.</p> 
 <p>Sven was stunned momentarily, but didn't turn Lina down. He only asked when he should come to pick her up.</p> 
 <p>Lina glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang and said that they would return home by themselves after they were done, so there was no need for him to pick them up.</p> 
 <p>As they watched Sven get into the car and drive away, Sheng Jiaoyang snaked her arm around Lina's arm, while using her other hand to rub her tummy. She said smilingly, "Xiao Tiantian, your mummy and I are going shopping now~"</p> 
 <p>Lina couldn't help but say, "Don't forget about Xiao Zhuangzhuang too."</p> 
 <p>"It's still too early to talk about Xiao Zhuangzhuang. For all you know, Xiao Zhuangzhuang could be a princess with a sword."</p> 
 <p>Lina let out a chuckle. *Indeed, I'm happy as long as I'm with my Little Sun."</p> 
 <p>Since Lina was close to her delivery, the places they shopped at would naturally be different from the shops they frequented in the past.</p> 
 <p>Back then, they shopped according to their inclinations, and the moment they started, it was as though they forgot what it meant to be tired. But now, they had to take breaks as they shopped, and the shops they visited were mostly shops that sold goods for infants and new moms.</p> 
 <p>At the end of the shopping trip, Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang looked at each other and smiled as they saw the bodyguards carrying bags of maternal and child supplies.</p> 
 <p>"It never occurred to me that one day, we would be shopping for these things."</p> 
 <p>Lina laughed, "In the past, we basically only thought of where we should go to have fun. Why would we think of getting married or having children?"</p> 
 <p>"I didn't know how long I could live then. Why would I think so far ahead?"</p> 
 <p>After realizing what she said, Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly changed the topic while pretending to be nonchalant about it. "I really want to see how Xiao Tiantian will look like when he is born. People say that sons will take after their mothers. Xiao Tiantian will definitely be a super handsome man in the future."</p> 
 <p>"I almost forgot that you are obsessed over cute boys." Lina looked at Sheng Jiaoyang teasingly. Sheng Jiaoyang's love for cute and handsome guys was rather secretive. Most people didn't know the person had to be outstandingly handsome for her to take interest.</p> 
 <p>"What do you mean by obsession? I am merely pursuing beauty." Sheng Jiaoyang lifted her chin haughtily.</p> 
 <p>"Then I'm afraid that you will no longer be able to continue your pursuit of beauty. Your Mr. Shen certainly doesn't like such pursuits."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow. "What's the big deal? What can he do to me? Tomorrow, I'll get a few super handsome male models to pose for me. I feel like it has been a long while since I last painted."</p> 
 <p>Lina could imagine the scene of someone turning into a green envious monster. <em>Jiaojiao is courting death.</em></p> 
 <p>"I would advise you not to do that."</p> 
 <p>"Why?"</p> 
 <p>"Didn’t you mention before that someone has already been contracted to be your male model in all your paintings?"</p> 
 <p>"Who's this bossy person?" Seeing the teasing expression on Lina's face, Sheng Jiaoyang understood who she was referring to instantly. <em>Ahem.</em> “That indeed sounds like something he would do."</p> 
 <p>Judging from that cold war that was caused by a single sentence then, it could be seen how terrifying Shen Zhining could be when he got jealous.</p> 
 <p><em>But Shen Zhining's physique…</em></p> 
 <p>"What are you thinking about? Why do you have such a weird smile on your face?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed, "Hehe, nothing. I was just thinking about how to make someone volunteer to be my model."</p> 
 <p>Lina could read her intention just from the look on her face. "That's a dangerous idea. Are you sure Mr. Shen will sacrifice himself for your art?"</p> 
 <p>"We will know after trying."</p> 
 <p>"I'm afraid that he would have devoured you whole before you could even start."</p> 
 <p>As they chatted leisurely, the car had already arrived before Lina's house.</p> 
 <p>"Be careful." Sheng Jiaoyang alighted first and carefully helped Lina down.</p> 
 <p>"Don't be so nervous. The doctor said the baby is very stable," Lina said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>"How can I not be? Xiao Tiantian is my son too."</p> 
 <p>Both Sheng Jiaoyang and Lina's attention was on the baby in her stomach, and they didn't notice that the bodyguards around them had stopped moving. Only when one of the bodyguards notified the two of them that there was a man in their way, did the two ladies notice the man standing at the porch.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing the man on the porch, Sheng Jiaoyang instantly turned to look at Lina, only to see that there wasn’t much change in her expression. It seems that his appearance did not cause any huge fluctuation in Lina’s mood. Sheng Jiaoyang felt her heart becoming more at ease.</p> 
 <p>"George, what are you doing here?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked in Lina's stead.</p> 
 <p>George looked like a changed man. He was unshaved, and if he changed into older clothes, he would totally look like a tramp who has seen the vicissitudes of life.</p> 
 <p>George didn't respond to Sheng Jiaoyang's questions. His eyes scanned over Lina's stomach and settled on her rosy face. His gaze was complex.</p> 
 <p>"Lina, you really are a heartless woman."</p> 
 <p>"Hey, what's the matter with you? You don't know anything. You have no right to say that to Mei Niu!" Sheng Jiaoyang stepped forward and stood in front of Lina.</p> 
 <p>"Yeah, I don't know anything. I'm a fool," said George with a look of mockery on his face. "Lina, you'd rather cheat on me to be with that man, and now, your belly is already so huge, but has that man married you?"</p> 
 <p>"George, get lost!" Sheng Jiaoyang gestured to the bodyguards around them to chase him away.</p> 
 <p>The bodyguards understood and surrounded Geroge, before dragging him off the porch.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang helped Lina to the door.</p> 
 <p>"Lina, I only want to ask. Do you regret it?" George shouted.</p> 
 <p>Lina stopped and turned to look at George. She replied with a composed expression, "I don't. Not at all."</p> 
 <p>George's expression of misery changed to one of fury. He said in a disappointed and infuriated tone, "Lina, my biggest misfortune in life was meeting you. I'm waiting to see the day when you end up being abandoned by that man."</p> 
 <p>"Quickly chase him away," Sheng Jiaoyang ordered.</p> 
 <p>"Wait," Lina ordered the bodyguards to halt instead.</p> 
 <p>"George, I didn't know you were someone who can't let go." The overflowing irony in her statement was enough to evoke a sense of rebellion in others.</p> 
 <p>George was quick to retort, "Yeah, that's the sort of person I am. I'm not like someone who can toy with other people’s feelings and throw them away when she's done playing with them."</p> 
 <p>Lina's lips were pressed into a thin line.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned and was about to ask the bodyguards to gag George and make him shut up when she suddenly saw Lina clutching her stomach.</p> 
 <p>"What's wrong?" Sheng Jiaoyang was extremely anxious.</p> 
 <p>"He's pushing down." Her brows were furrowed as cold sweat appeared on her forehead.</p> 
 <p>Of course, she was referring to the child in her womb.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's expression changed immediately, and she quickly helped Lina to the car and ordered the bodyguards, "Quick, drive to the hospital."</p> 
 <p>The bodyguards immediately placed George down and boarded the car.</p> 
 <p>George was stunned momentarily, before he hurriedly got in his car as well.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu, how are you feeling now?" Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Lina anxiously. </p> 
 <p>Lina took a deep breath. "I'm… I'm fine."</p> 
 <p>"Okay, you must tell me if you can't take it anymore."</p> 
 <p>The moment they reached the hospital, Lina was wheeled into the delivery room.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at George as he stood at a distance. She really wished she could go over and beat him up. It was because of what he said that Lina's emotions were stirred. Otherwise, Lina would still be in great health and waiting to deliver her baby.</p> 
 <p>George's face was obscured by his hands, and no one could see his expression.</p> 
 <p>"Are you happy now?" Sheng Jiaoyang approached George.</p> 
 <p>George placed his hands down and icily glared at Sheng Jiaoyang, but he remained silent.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's mouth twitched, "I really don't want to talk to you. If you hadn't appeared, I would have totally forgotten about your existence."</p> 
 <p>George still kept mum, as if he didn't want to speak to her at all.</p> 
 <p>"George, you feel unjust, and you harbour grievances in your heart. You feel that Lina did you wrong, and that's why you came running over like a dissatisfied housewife and boldly hurt Lina with your words. I can understand that. An ignorant person always appears stupid and annoying."</p> 
 <p>"Go away, I don't want to hear what you want to say," George finally spoke up, but it was to chase Sheng Jiaoyang away. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang narrowed her eyes and a dark glint flickered across the recesses of her eyes. She gave an eccentric smile and said, "Okay, since you want to continue to be ignorant, I will let you stay that way. Don't you ever come knocking at our door again."</p> 
 <p>She turned to walk towards the waiting area and sat down.</p> 
 <p>Before two minutes had passed, a confused George walked over.</p> 
 <p>"Why did you call me ignorant? What do you know?" George looked over the shoulder of the bodyguard in front of him at Sheng Jiaoyang as she sat on her seat and drank water.</p> 
 <p>This time, it was Sheng Jiaoyang's turn to remain silent.</p> 
 <p>George took a step forward but was stopped by the bodyguard. Streaks of anxiety appeared on his face.</p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao, what exactly do you know?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang finally turned to look at George. Having seized the initiative, Sheng Jiaoyang was in no hurry, "You said you didn't want to hear what I say."</p> 
 <p>"What do you know? Tell me!"</p> 
 <p>Hearing George’s slightly hysterical demand, Sheng Jiaoyang's lips curled upwards as she said, word by word, "I'm. Not. Telling. You."</p> 
 <p>George was enraged, but with two strong bodyguards standing before him, he could not get closer to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Just then, she heard the sounds of footsteps.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked towards the direction of the footsteps, and saw Sven hurrying over.</p> 
 <p>"How's Lina?" Sven spoke rapidly, a stark contrast from his usual composed self.</p> 
 <p>"I have no idea either." Sheng Jiaoyang shook her head.</p> 
 <p>She was anxious too, but anxiety contributed nothing to the situation. Now, she could only pin her hopes on the doctor.</p> 
 <p>Sven rubbed the area between his brows. He suddenly looked up at George with an icy glare, "Why are you here?"</p> 
 <p>"Why can't I be here? For all you know, the kid in Lina's stomach is mine." George raised his chin.</p> 
 <p><em>Bang!</em> George fell to the ground from a single blow.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stood up.</p> 
 <p>Sven curled his sleeves up. As soon as George got up, Sven flung another punch at him and knocked him onto the ground once again.</p> 
 <p>Sven's actions were not brutal, but his punches were strong, as could be seen from the fact that George had been knocked down to the ground twice by him.</p> 
 <p>George looked very tall, but when he stood before Sven, who was equally tall, he was completely outmatched by Sven, and could only take the punches. After all, George might look strong and sturdy, but he was a medical researcher who had neglected exercise, and hence lacked the strength to do something in such critical moments.</p> 
 <p>Sven, on the other hand, might look elegant like an aristocrat, but deep inside him was a wild and explosive madness.</p> 
 <p>"Sven," Sheng Jiaoyang called out to Sven, who was readying himself to throw out another punch.</p> 
 <p>Sven slowly turned his head around. "What? Do you want to protect him?"</p> 
 <p>"It's not me who wants to protect him. It was never me to begin with," Sheng Jiaoyang said coldly.</p> 
 <p>Sven halted and went silent for a moment before he unrolled his sleeves and turned to sit opposite Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>George struggled to get himself up. Then, he stared at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p> 
 <p>"My words are as literal as they can get."</p> 
 <p>"I can tell you," Sven said all of a sudden.</p> 
 <p>George looked at him.</p> 
 <p>"Beg me, and I'll tell you everything, from the start till the end." There was a subtle smile on his lips.</p> 
 <p>"Sven, you better not do this," Sheng Jiaoyang warned him.</p> 
 <p>George looked at Sheng Jiaoyang. Initially, he was still gripped by hesitation, but now, curiosity was biting at him, and he wanted to know what they were hiding. When a person’s curiosity was triggered, it couldn’t be suppressed easily unless the mystery was revealed. Moreover, this thing was closely related to him, and hence, he was even more intrigued.</p> 
 <p>George let out a deep breath and looked at Sven, "I'm begging you."</p> 
 <p>The corners of Sven's lips curled up," It was good for everyone to keep it from you, but now, I want to add some enjoyment to my life."</p> 
 <p>"Sven, if you do this, Lina would be upset."</p> 
 <p>"I’ll do it as long as it makes me happy."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang furrowed her brows and wanted to say something when the door of the delivery room was pushed open. A nurse came out and asked, "Who's a family member?"</p> 
 <p>"I am."</p> 
 <p>"Me."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the two men who answered at the same time before asking the nurse, "How is Lina?"</p> 
 <p>"Dr. Victor is inducing labor for her, but the fetus is in an abnormal position, and the mother would likely have to undergo C-section. That's why I'm asking for a family member to sign a confirmation letter for the operation."</p> 
 <p>Dr. Victor was the doctor who Lina usually went to for her pregnancy scans.</p> 
 <p>"I'll sign it," George promptly replied.</p> 
 <p>"Are you mistaken? You are already history, so what right do you have to sign this?" Sven only lifted his hand ever so slightly before his guards knowingly stepped forward and stopped George in his tracks.</p> 
 <p>"I don't have any rights, but do you? Are both of you married? You guys are not even engaged! At least, I was her husband."</p> 
 <p>"You said it yourself, you <em>were</em> Lina's ex-husband, while I will be her future life partner. Not to mention, the child in her belly is mine," Sven said with a nonchalant look.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang ignored the two bickering men and walked up to the nurse, "I'll sign it."</p> 
 <p>The two men at ‘war’ ceased their battles.</p> 
 <p>Before the nurse re-entered the delivery room, she shot a strange glance at the crowd.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the closed doors of the delivery room, George looked at Sven and said, "Didn't you say you were going to tell me something?"</p> 
 <p>"I have to think about what thing to say to maximize your misery." Sven's lips curled into a slight sneer.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang returned to where she sat previously and watched the drama unfold before her.</p> 
 <p>"I already begged you just now," George had a bitter expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>"I remember. But now, I've decided not to tell you. I'd rather see you continue to be a fool than tell you and let you get in my way."</p> 
 <p>Sven folded his arms across his chest and said.</p> 
 <p>George clenched his fists tightly and looked towards Sheng Jiaoyang, who was simply enjoying the show by the side. "What about you?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow, "I decided to be a bystander. You guys can do whatever you want. This has nothing to do with me."</p> 
 <p>George's expression turned rather ugly as his gaze alternated between both Sven and Sheng Jiaoyang. "Sooner or later, I'll figure it out one day."</p> 
 <p>Sven's lips curled upwards. "We shall see."</p>
