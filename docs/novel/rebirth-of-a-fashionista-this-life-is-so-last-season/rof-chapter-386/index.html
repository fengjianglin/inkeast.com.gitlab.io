 <p>When Lin Yan saw the look on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face, he became dazed for a brief moment, before he quickly recollected himself and asked softly, “Did you regain your lost memories?”</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang saw that his tense face became much more relaxed when he heard her response, and her heart sank, “But I really want to remember.”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao…” </p> 
 <p>“Originally, I wanted to ask you for your help to restore my memory, but I feel like I can’t trust you anymore. I’m afraid that in the end, I wouldn’t even be able to remember who I am.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan fell silent. </p> 
 <p>Since the day they separated at the airport, he knew that this would be the result.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, even if I had always been the one taking the initiative to pursue you in the past, you should know what I’m like. If I decide to give up on something, I will never turn back. If you thought that I would be with you just because I lost two years of my memory, you’re wrong. Although I only remember liking you, my heart no longer feels the same way.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan frowned slightly. Even before she told him that, he had already felt it. When he tried to kiss her on the porch but got pushed away, he knew that her heart was not with him. However, he still felt unresigned, and he wanted to try one last time.</p> 
 <p>“You shouldn’t have come here. That day at the airport, you already made your choice,” Sheng Jiaoyang said calmly.</p> 
 <p>“You said that you would wait for me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly laughed, “I only said that so you could go back and resolve your issues without worrying.” </p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, we’re all adults now. Don’t act impulsively anymore. We all have too many things waiting for us. There’s no need to stake everything on love. Since you’ve already missed your chance, just let it go. In the future…”</p> 
 <p>“Can we just be friends?” Sheng Jiaoyang stared seriously at Lin Yan. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s hands clenched into fists, “This is the second time you’ve said that.”</p> 
 <p>“No matter how many times I have to say it, my reply will always be the same.” </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan stared silently at her with a wounded gaze.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sighed, “You should be more open minded. If we stay as friends, you wouldn’t need to worry about this matter anymore. When we see each other doing well in life, we’ll both be happy for each other. Lin Yan, I sincerely hope you can find someone to live your life with, but that person isn’t me.” </p> 
 <p>“How do you know you…”</p> 
 <p>“Women are all unreasonable, and I’m no exception. Since I don’t lack anything, I’m even more unreasonable with my feelings. If you can’t give me your whole heart and soul, I wouldn’t want to invest any more of my feelings.”</p> 
 <p>“Just wait two years for me. Then, I guarantee I’ll give you my everything.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shook her head, “Don’t lie to me anymore. Your heart has never leaned towards love.”</p> 
 <p>“You said you wanted my entire heart and soul. Can Shen Zhining give that to you? Doesn’t he spend his whole day working on his own stuff as well?”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t need him to constantly revolve around me. All I need is for him to place me in the deepest part of his heart and give me enough security and love.”</p> 
 <p>For a moment, they both fell silent. </p> 
 <p>Finally, Lin Yan closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh before he reopened his eyes and stared at her. The complicated emotions in his eyes were heart wrenching. He took a step back, and he revealed a helpless, bitter smile on his face. “Alright then, let’s just be friends.”</p> 
 <p>Now that things have reached this stage, what else could he do?</p> 
 <p>He knew that right now, he couldn’t give her his wholehearted love. He couldn’t risk everything he had just for love, and there were still a lot of things waiting for him to do. </p> 
 <p>A gentle smile appeared on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face as she watched the man before her start to mature. She recalled the lonely figure plucking at the piano and her heart felt a bit sour. However, she also felt very relieved and relaxed. </p> 
 <p>Their youthful love had finally ended. <em>May we both find our happiness.</em></p> 
 <p>“Farewell, Lin Yan.” </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s lips twitched, and ultimately, he chose to say nothing. He simply waved his arm in reply.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused for a moment before running up to him and giving him a hug. </p> 
 <p>“Let me help you recover your memory,” Lin Yan said gently in her ear. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hesitated and stepped back before asking, “Can I recover my memory on my own?”</p> 
 <p>“You don’t trust me?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pondered for a moment, but she was unable to find any other excuse. She really didn’t trust Lin Yan, and she was worried that he would do something again and turn her into a fool without any memories at all.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan felt his heart clench. However, he brought this upon himself, so he couldn’t blame anyone else but him.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t do something like that again.” </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan sighed when he saw that she was remaining silent, and he continued saying, “Your memory loss is only temporary. After a while, your memory will slowly come back as you interact with the things and people that are familiar to you. It just takes time.”</p> 
 <p>“Then I’ll just recover by myself.” Although she knew that saying this would hurt Lin Yan, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t want to take any risks.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan stared at Sheng Jiaoyang deeply. </p> 
 <p>“I have a tight schedule, so I’ll be going first.” Sheng Jiaoyang pointed at the film set. </p> 
 <p>“… Alright.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan simply stood there and watched her return to the set. He only left after a long while. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, he left,” Zeng Huan said quietly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned her head and saw his back slowly disappearing into the distance. A frown subconsciously appeared on her face as an indescribable feeling filled her heart. She felt a bit empty.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan represented her youth, and the pure and unadulterated love of her first crush. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, there were probably some people who took a picture of you two when you hugged him earlier. You better let Mr. Shen know about it first. It wouldn’t be good if he sees it in the news and misunderstands,” Zeng Huan reminded her. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked back and glanced at Zeng Huan, and dismissively said, “It was just a farewell.” </p> 
 <p>However, reality soon proved that Zeng Huan’s reminder was necessary. </p> 
 <p>Their filming spot wasn’t some secret or desolate location. While they were filming, there would always be some people loitering at the side. With Sheng Jiaoyang’s current fame and status, there would naturally be paparazzi following her around to try and scoop up some news.</p> 
 <p>Very soon, somebody posted an article about her acting intimately with another man, and even posted the picture of them hugging. </p> 
 <p>However, Shen Zhining was even faster than the gossip magazines.</p> 
 <p>When he arrived, Sheng Jiaoyang had just finished filming a scene, and she was preparing to take a break.</p> 
 <p>When she noticed Shen Zhining’s arrival, Sheng Jiaoyang was startled, and she glanced briefly at Zeng Huan, thinking that she had called him over. Zeng Huan instantly understood what her glance meant, and she hastily shook her head to deny it. </p> 
 <p>“Why did you come?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked around before he asked, “Are you free?”</p> 
 <p>“What happened?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him vigilantly. <em>He couldn’t have heard something and came over to scold her, right?</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll take you to meet somebody.”</p> 
 <p>“Meet who?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised a brow, “You’ll know when you see her. I guarantee you’ll like her.” </p>
