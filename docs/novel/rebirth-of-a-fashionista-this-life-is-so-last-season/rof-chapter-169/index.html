 <p>Seeing that it was getting late, Sheng Jiaoyang patted Xiao An's head and said, "I have to clean up the studio, so go and ask Uncle An Jing to help you take a bath first."</p> 
 <p>Xiao An nodded obediently and walked out of the studio.</p> 
 <p>Only after Sheng Jiaoyang had tidied up the studio, cleaned the tools and put them back in their original spot, did she return to the bedroom.</p> 
 <p>The bathroom light was on and some faint sounds could be heard coming from within the bathroom. She cast a glance at the bathroom door before plopping down on the beanbag with her cell phone in hand. Playing with her phone had already become a habit. She’d surf the internet and read the news every day. When she finished reading the latest news and saw that Xiao An hadn't come out yet, she proceeded to check the entertainment news headlines.</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, the moment she opened the entertainment news page, the first thing to appear was a headline related to Mei Niu. There was also news about her, but she wasn’t interested in that. She was quite curious about Mei Niu's gossip, hence she clicked on the headline titled ‘Lina's new boyfriend’ and what came into sight was a collection of GIFs. Her jaw dropped the instant she clicked on the first GIF.</p> 
 <p>It was a GIF of Lina kissing an Italian man. It showed Lina holding the man's face and kissing him, to the man’s hand slipping past Lina’s hair to the back of her head in response. The GIF was only two seconds, but the content alone made one’s blood run hot.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s going on?! To think that Lina was the one initiating the kiss!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Lina was obviously still feeling dejected over her breakup yesterday, but she’d unexpectedly kissed someone else today.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Who’s that man?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to scroll down to read further when she heard the door slide open. She looked over and saw Xiao An come out wearing a pair of cow pajamas. She put down her phone and walked forward with a fluttering feeling in her heart and pinched Xiao An's cheeks.</p> 
 <p>"Could our Xiao An be any cuter?!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang inadvertently looked up and noticed the person who’d followed Xiao An out of the bathroom. She was dumbstruck and asked, "Why are you here?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining merely stared at her without a word.</p> 
 <p>Upon noticing that his clothes were all wet, Sheng Jiaoyang cast a glance at him before shifting her gaze to Xiao An. "Weren’t you just helping Xiao An take a bath? How did you end up like that?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang helplessly patted Xiao An and asked him to go to bed. Afterwards, she pushed Shen Zhining back inside the bathroom and urged, "You should quickly take a warm bath too, so you don’t catch a cold later. Pass me your wet clothes and I’ll go dry them for you."</p> 
 <p>She was like an amah. When she turned around and saw Xiao An’s tiny face poking out of the blanket and staring at them quietly, she hurried to his side again to coax him to sleep. After Xiao An closed his eyes and gradually fell asleep, she walked to the bathroom door and loudly whispered, "Pass me your wet clothes."</p> 
 <p>However, only the sound of running water was heard. Shen Zhining didn’t respond, so she wasn’t sure if he’d heard her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused for a moment before leaving the room. She went downstairs and walked around, but she didn’t see her grandfather or An Jing. Thus, she proceeded to their room. Now that An Jing was taking care of her grandfather's everyday life, he lived in the same room as her grandfather.</p> 
 <p>She stopped at the door with a hesitant look on her face. What she was about to ask was a little awkward…</p> 
 <p>In the end, she still knocked on the door.</p> 
 <p>Soon after, the door was opened. An Jing looked at her and whispered, "Grandfather’s already asleep. If there’s anything you need, you can tell him tomorrow."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also lowered her voice as she said, "I'm here for you." </p> 
 <p>Hearing this, surprise flashed in An Jing’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>A trace of awkwardness appeared on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face and she lightly coughed. Her gaze drifted elsewhere as she murmured, "Do you have any new, unworn…underwear?"</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>"Uhhh, don't get me wrong! Shen Zhining helped Xiao An take a bath and his clothes got wet. It's quite easy to catch a cold in this weather, so I asked him to take a warm bath,” Sheng Jiaoyang blushed slightly as she explained.</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, a smile flashed past An Jing's eyes. He nodded and said, "I have new ones, please wait for a moment."</p> 
 <p>"Okay." <em>How embarrassing!</em></p> 
 <p>Soon after, An Jing came back with a piece of nicely folded cloth.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took the cloth and thanked him. She then hurriedly turned around and rushed back to her room.</p> 
 <p>Back in her room, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately walked to the bathroom door. She raised her hand and was about to knock when the door slid open, revealing Shen Zhining in a close-fitting white bathrobe.</p> 
 <p>When her eyes landed on the bathrobe, she almost stomped about in anger. "Why are you wearing my bathrobe?"</p> 
 <p>That was her bathrobe, so it was naturally her size. Shen Zhining was taller than her and well-built, so her loose fitting bathrobe naturally turned into a tight fitting bathrobe on him.</p> 
 <p>"How about…I give it back to you?" Shen Zhining placed his hand on the bathrobe belt.</p> 
 <p>"Don't!" Sheng Jiaoyang could already see his slightly exposed chest underneath the loose neckline.</p> 
 <p>She took a deep breath and turned around. "Wait a moment, I'll go and borrow another pair of pajamas for you."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining reached out and grabbed her arm. His eyes fell on the cloth in Sheng Jiaoyang's hand and he slightly raised an eyebrow. "What’s that in your hand?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked down and her cheeks instantly flushed tomato red. She shoved the cloth into Shen Zhining's hand and hastily said, "It hasn’t been worn by anyone else."</p> 
 <p>With that said, she was ready to slip away, but the grip on her arm suddenly tightened.</p> 
 <p>"What?" she asked, feigning calmness.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining glanced at the tip of her reddened ears and his lips curled upwards slightly. "Didn't you say that you were going to help me dry my clothes?"</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Sheng Jiaoyang also recalled this matter. She held out her other hand and said, "Hurry up and give me your wet clothes."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pulled her into an embrace and placed his arms around her waist. "Instead of going through so much trouble, you might as well keep me for the night. I'll ask Felix to bring a set of clean clothes tomorrow."</p> 
 <p>"Didn’t you buy the house next door? Ask Felix to bring the clothes now."</p> 
 <p>"The house isn’t furnished yet."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining in utter disbelief.</p> 
 <p>"Besides, Man Jun has already left,” Shen Zhining added.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang knew that Man Jun was Shen Zhining's chauffeur.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the smile on Shen Zhining’s face, Sheng Jiaoyang pursed her lips and said, "In that case, I'll ask Aunt Zhang to tidy up a guest room for you."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to look at her bed before smiling at her. "Your bed is huge, and it's the perfect size for our family of three to sleep in."</p> 
 <p>"Who said I’m a part of your family of three?" Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand and pushed him away.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining actively let go and said, "Aunt Zhang is an elder, so let’s not bother her. Go ahead and take a bath. I'll wait for you," after saying this, he walked towards the bed.</p> 
 <p><em>Wait for me to do what?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang watched Shen Zhining walk away with a stupefied expression. She then saw him calmly lift up her blanket and lay! Down! On! Her! Bed!</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took a deep breath before walking to her wardrobe. She grabbed the most conservative pair of pajamas in a draw and went to the bathroom.</p> 
 <p>After dilly-dallying for some time, she finally came out of the bathroom. When she saw that Shen Zhining had seemingly fallen asleep, she breathed a sigh of relief. She walked to the bedside and saw that Shen Zhining was occupying the middle spot with the sound asleep Xiao An on one side, and an empty spot with a blanket on the other, clearly left for her.</p> 
 <p>Because she was afraid that she’d fight over the blanket with Xiao An at night, they each used their own blanket. Now, her blanket was half occupied by the shameless Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly hesitated. <em>Did she really want to date someone like him, who didn’t know the definition of ‘give them an inch and they'll take a mile’? Why did she feel like she’d fallen into a fire pit?</em></p> 
 <p>While she was letting her imagination run wild, she suddenly felt a gust of wind. Her hand was seized, and with a tug, she fell down on the bed. No, on someone, to be exact. Afterwards, the blanket landed on top of her, covering her head completely. Her glasses also fell on the bed.</p> 
 <p>She angrily lifted the blanket and hissed, "You…"</p> 
 <p>"Shh!" Shen Zhining motioned next to him.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing the sound asleep Xiao An, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately quieted down.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, her attention turned to her hand. She looked down, and…her face instantly flushed.</p> 
 <p><em>Shen Zhining had no clothes on! No clothes, no clothes!</em></p> 
 <p>The most important part was repeated three times.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang desperately tried to get up, but the hand on her back restrained her movements.</p> 
 <p>"You’re not sleepy? Then, let's do something else to pass the time."</p> 
 <p>"No, I'm sleepy, I’m really sleepy!" Sheng Jiaoyang firmly declined. Shen Zhining’s words obviously carried the hint of a double-entendre.</p> 
 <p>"Let’s sleep then."</p> 
 <p>"You…move your hands away first…" Upon noticing that Shen Zhining was seemingly afraid that she’d take advantage of this opportunity to escape, Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly promised, "I'll sleep right away, but I can't…sleep in this position, okay?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining fixed his gaze on her for a while before removing the hand that was pressing on her back. Then, he watched her lie down with her back towards him, but…</p> 
 <p>He reached out and pulled her into his arms. "Although you’re not scared of falling off the bed, I'm afraid that you'll snatch the blanket away from me."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang froze. <em>She’s going to suffer from insomnia tonight for sure. She’d never shared a bed with a man before.</em></p> 
 <p>"Alright, let’s sleep." Shen Zhining let go of his hand and placed the glasses she’d dropped in the headboard’s storage compartment. After that, there were no more movements.</p> 
 <p>After waiting for a long while, Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at him. Seeing that he’d seemingly fallen asleep, she finally relaxed. She stroked the edge of the blanket before closing her eyes.</p> 
 <p>She slept until she awoke naturally.</p> 
 <p><em>Today, the blanket was particularly nice and warm, and there was also an automatic heating pillow…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Hold on!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang abruptly opened her eyes, and what came into view was a pair of deep eyes.</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>She closed her eyes again and murmured under her breath, "I’m probably still dreaming, I'll be fine if I wake up now."</p> 
 <p>"Pfft~" Magnetic and slightly husky laughter travelled to her ear.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang instantly sobered up and the previous night’s events quickly flashed before her eyes. </p> 
 <p><em>OMG! She’d actually slept in the same bed as the naked Demon King Shen all the way till morning?!</em></p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a hand grasped her left hand. "Feel with your hand and you’ll know if I slept naked."</p> 
 <p>In that split second, Sheng Jiaoyang felt that, this time, she’d certainly suffered from Demon King Shen’s greatest grudge in history!</p> 
 <p>Before she could break free from his grip, her fingertips touched the edge of the cloth and warm abs.</p> 
 <p>"Also." Shen Zhining leaned closer to her ear, his lips touching her earlobe as he quietly asked her, "Why do you call me Demon King Shen?"</p> 
 <p><em>…I’m done for.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang buried her face in the blanket.</p>
