 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned when she saw that Sven was standing at the doorsteps of Lina’s house.</p> 
 <p>From Sheng Jiaoyang’s perspective, there was nothing positive about Sven at all. After all, he was the one who ruined the relationship between Lina and George.</p> 
 <p><em>If it weren’t for your background, I would have certainly found a way to kill you already!</em></p> 
 <p>Sven didn’t even raise his eyes to look at Sheng Jiaoyang after she questioned him in such a sarcastic manner. Instead, his eyes were locked onto Lina, who was currently leaning on Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>With her bodyguards standing behind her, Sheng Jiaoyang wasn’t worried that Sven would do something to them. However, the corners of Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips still twitched violently when she noticed that Sven was ignoring her and staring at Lina. She quickly supported Lina to the door.</p> 
 <p>The moment she fished the key out from her pocket, she noticed a shadow hovering over her head. She immediately put her guard up and stared warily at Sven as he approached.</p> 
 <p>Sven didn't pay her any attention at all. Instead, he stretched his arms out and pulled Lina into his embrace.</p> 
 <p>"What are you doing? Give Lina back to me!" Sheng Jiaoyang was startled by his action, and she was about to call her bodyguards up to help her when she heard Sven urge her in an impatient manner, "Hurry up and open the door. Do you want Lina to catch a cold in this weather?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took a deep breath and silently reminded herself not to argue with him.</p> 
 <p>As soon as she opened the door, she was knocked out of the way.</p> 
 <p>"Where is Lina's bedroom?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had just been hit, so she was furious. However, she could only restrain herself after hearing Sven’s words. She pointed towards Lina’s bedroom, and Sven immediately headed towards the room. Sheng Jiaoyang followed behind him, as she was worried about what Sven might do to Lina. When she went into Lina’s bedroom, she saw Sven gently placing Lina on the bed.</p> 
 <p>Right when Sven was about to take off Lina’s coat, Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly stopped him. "You can leave now. I will help Lina take off her coat." </p> 
 <p>Sven stopped momentarily. Then, he withdrew his hands, stood up, and cast a cold glance at Sheng Jiaoyang before walking away.</p> 
 <p><em>Why is he so obedient now?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang was slightly surprised by Sven’s behaviour, but she quickly put aside her thoughts and went to help Lina take off her coat.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Sheng Jiaoyang walked out of Lina’s bedroom, and she saw that Sven was standing in front of the wedding present that she had previously gifted to Lina. He let out a puff of cigarette smoke at the oil painting of Lina and George in their wedding attire.</p> 
 <p>"Please don't smoke in here. Thank you!" Sheng Jiaoyang coldly exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Sven let the unfinished cigarette fall to the ground. Then, he lifted his leather boots and crushed the cigarette butt under his foot.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned at this sight. She really wanted to let her anger loose, but she knew full well that this wasn’t a good way to solve the problem, as she was far less powerful than her opponent.</p> 
 <p>"Say, when would you stop pestering Lina?"</p> 
 <p>Sven turned his head and glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang. The corners of his lips curled upwards as he said in a cheerful tone, "I heard that my darling has already signed the divorce papers."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyelids twitched in anger.</p> 
 <p>Sven stared at the oil painting and added, "It happened faster than I expected, but now that I think about it, it’s really not that surprising at all. It’s just that I’ve overestimated George." </p> 
 <p>"You've already made them sign the divorce papers, and you already obtained Lina. What else are you not satisfied with? It’s time for you to let go." </p> 
 <p>"I have obtained her? No, that’s far from enough. I want to see me up there with her."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes followed Sven’s gaze up to the oil painting, before realisation struck her when she saw the painting of George standing beside Lina. <em>Sven wants to replace George.</em></p> 
 <p>It seemed that her previous judgment about Sven was wrong. She initially thought that Sven was just a paranoid person who wanted to obtain Lina only because of his failed attempt to have a one-night stand with Lina. The initial reason that prompted him to chase after Lina might not be much different, but she was obviously wrong about his main goal.</p> 
 <p><em>This guy doesn't just want to turn a one-night stand into a multi-night stand, he wants to turn a multi-night stand into legitimate possession.</em></p> 
 <p>"Do you love Lina?"</p> 
 <p>"Love? Maybe." There was a frivolous smile on Sven's face, making him appear even more untrustworthy.</p> 
 <p>"You are gravely mistaken, you do not love her at all. If you love her, how can you bear to let her bear so much mental burden? How can you bear to see her land in such a sad and devastating situation? You are like a child who thinks that if others have a particular toy, then you must also possess it. You regard this entire situation as a game, so you just play around unscrupulously without considering the impact it has on Lina. You just think of her as your plaything!"</p> 
 <p>Sven looked at Sheng Jiaoyang calmly. "You can think whatever you want, it has nothing to do with me."</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, he turned around and walked away.</p> 
 <p>"Sven, you will regret this!" Sheng Jiaoyang shouted at his disappearing figure.</p> 
 <p>Sven left without looking back.</p> 
 <p>The next day, Lina came out of her bedroom in a daze and saw Sheng Jiaoyang arranging food on a plate at the dining table. She immediately sobered up.</p> 
 <p>"I was just about to wake you up for breakfast!" Sheng Jiaoyang said when she heard her footsteps.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, you made me breakfast?" Lina knew how bad of a cook Sheng Jiaoyang was.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t turn to look at her friend as she placed a bouquet of flowers into the vase. "Don't worry, I bought take-outs. I wouldn’t dare to cook breakfast for you."</p> 
 <p>Lina walked forward and hugged Sheng Jiaoyang's waist from behind. "Jiaojiao, you might as well come live with me. Forget about your Mr. Shen."</p> 
 <p>"Okay, sure!" Sheng Jiaoyang answered without a second thought.</p> 
 <p>Lina was momentarily stunned. She then said with a smile, "No, I'm just kidding. If you abandon your Mr. Shen for me, he will tear me into pieces."</p> 
 <p>"As if he would dare to do that!"</p> 
 <p>Lina smiled cheerfully, "Would you dare to tell him right in his face that you don't want him anymore?"</p> 
 <p>"…I wouldn’t dare to." Sheng Jiaoyang held her breath and answered flatly.</p> 
 <p>Lina burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and started tickling Lina. Lina moved back as she tried to dodge, but as she continued dodging Sheng Jiaoyang’s attempt to tickle her, she suddenly stepped onto something. She moved her foot away and saw that it was a squashed cigarette.</p> 
 <p>The smile on Lina's face froze. She looked up to see that Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression had also changed.</p> 
 <p>"Who came over last night?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hated herself for forgetting to discard the cigarette, even though she had such a good memory. After thinking about it, she decided not to hide the previous night’s incident from Lina. "It was Sven."</p> 
 <p>Lina frowned instantly.</p> 
 <p>"You were drunk last night. When we came back together, I saw Sven waiting at the door…"</p> 
 <p>Lina nodded and the muscles around her eyebrows relaxed slightly. She then pushed Sheng Jiaoyang towards the dining table.</p> 
 <p>"He can do as he pleases. He can come here if he wants to. In any case, I won't bother with him anymore."</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu, he stood in front of that oil painting yesterday, and he said that he wanted to see himself up there with you."</p> 
 <p>Lina halted for a brief moment, but she didn’t say anything. She simply sat down at the dining table.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Lina and said solemnly, "I don't think he will give up so easily."</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere quieted down for a moment.</p> 
 <p>After a moment of silence, Lina looked up at Sheng Jiaoyang and said, "No matter what happens, I am not getting together with him."</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm, let's stop talking about him. Hurry and dig into breakfast. Then, I'll go to the lab with you to see how your research is going."</p> 
 <p>When the topic became about the things she liked, Lina’s expression became much softer. She smiled and said, "The research isn’t done yet, but the results are getting closer to my expectations." </p> 
 <p>"That's good progress!"</p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the company, Sheng Jiaoyang followed Lina into the laboratory and smelled the sample developed by Lina. The fragrance was very faint. She thought that the fragrance was very pleasant, and when Lina took the bottle away, she began to miss that fragrance.</p> 
 <p>"Is this an upgraded version of ‘Charming Angel’?" Sheng Jiaoyang stared at the light pink perfume inside the bottle.</p> 
 <p>Although Lina had said that it was only a semi-finished product, the newly developed perfume was more fascinating than the SL Series’ Charming Angel, their previous bestseller.</p> 
 <p>"You can say that. That’s why I’m planning to name it ‘Charming Angel No. 2’ when we launch the perfume."</p> 
 <p>"Looks like the experiment is almost over. It must be very difficult to improve this formula any further."</p> 
 <p>"No matter how difficult it is, I have to come up with the best possible recipe. I have a hunch that it should be ready soon."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded, "Alright then, you can take your time. I'm going to hang out in your office."</p> 
 <p>"Go ahead. I'll come look for you when it’s lunchtime." Lina waved her goodbye.</p> 
 <p>When it was lunchtime, Paul and Rita joined them at the canteen.</p> 
 <p>Rita didn't know about Lina and George's divorce. During lunch, she kept talking about how she had to come up with plans to slip away from home and come join them.</p> 
 <p>"Were you looking for us or Paul?" Sheng Jiaoyang teased.</p> 
 <p>"Aiii, why go into such detail? In any case, you are all here now," Rita shrugged and replied indifferently.</p> 
 <p>"Previously, you were free to go wherever you want, right? Why won't your father let you out this time?"</p> 
 <p>Rita placed a piece of medium-rare steak into her mouth and mumbled while chewing, "Recently, there have been many changes in the Bruno Family, and it has led to quite a lot of trouble. We have some kind of cooperation with them, so my dad wanted me to follow him to handle these matters. Hence, he didn’t allow me to go out."</p> 
 <p>"Then, why did you come out?"</p> 
 <p>Rita stared at Paul with a sweet gaze and said, "Because Paul said he missed me!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was rendered speechless, and she couldn’t do anything but stare at Rita. From the corner of her eye, she noticed that Lina had stopped eating and turned to see that Lina's expression was somewhat strange.</p> 
 <p>"What's the matter, Mei Niu?"</p> 
 <p>Lina returned to her senses and shook her head with a smile. Then, she looked at Rita and asked, "Did you just say the Bruno Family?"</p> 
 <p>"Yep," Rita answered casually.</p> 
 <p>Rita then suddenly remembered something and stared at Lina. "I remember now! Isn’t your father the head of the Bruno Family?! I remember that your brother's name is Lin Yan, right? He is so powerful now! He’s actually being guided by the family head to become the next successor."</p> 
 <p>Lina froze.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was also stupefied.</p> 
 <p>Rita felt strange when she saw Lina's expression. "You weren’t aware of this? The head of Bruno Family has already announced that Lin Yan would be his successor."</p> 
 <p>Lina felt a little awkward. Recently, her own affairs were a mess, so she didn’t have time to care about her family affairs.</p> 
 <p>"He finally got what he wanted," Sheng Jiaoyang murmured.</p> 
 <p>"What did you say?" Rita asked curiously, as the words that Sheng Jiaoyang blurted out were in Chinese.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang simply smiled at her.</p>
