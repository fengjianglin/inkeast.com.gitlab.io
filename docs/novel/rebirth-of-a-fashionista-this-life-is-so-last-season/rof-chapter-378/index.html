 <p>Lin Yan came after them.</p> 
 <p>When she heard the commotion happening outside the room, Sheng Jiaoyang felt very moved.</p> 
 <p><em>Bam!</em> In the blink of an eye, an arm was suddenly buried into the wall, and it coincidentally blocked her line of sight.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around, only to see Shen Zhining, who had an expression like the devil. His current expression perfectly matched the image she had of him from her past memories.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing?” <em>Is he thinking of hitting me?</em></p> 
 <p>“Do you like Lin Yan that much?” Shen Zhining breathed heavily as he asked.</p> 
 <p>“I liked him since I was 15, and I have never stopped liking him ever since, even up until now.” Sheng Jiaoyang had forgotten that she was missing two years of memory.</p> 
 <p>“You have never stopped liking him… What a great answer.” Shen Zhining gnashed his teeth as he glared at her, eyes filled with complex and confused emotions.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked back at Shen Zhining. From what she could recall, Shen Zhining was still a brutal demon king. Thus, she did not believe that she would come to love a person who she was so afraid of in the short span of just two years. Instead, she felt more inclined to believe in Lin Yan’s words.</p> 
 <p>“I…” Shen Zhining looked extremely serious and solemn, and his eyes were filled with deep love and hurt. This made Sheng Jiaoyang feel extremely curious about the memories that she had lost.</p> 
 <p>From the memories that she could access, Sheng Jiaoyang could not recall ever seeing Shen Zhining look at her with such an expression. She could feel that they had once shared a deep relationship. If Shen Zhining had looked at her with the same eyes in the past, she would definitely have known about it. Something must have changed within the past two years.</p> 
 <p>She was about to start talking, when she was cut off abruptly.</p> 
 <p>“Leave.” Shen Zhining uttered with much difficulty.</p> 
 <p>A person’s emotions could be easily revealed through their eyes. Sheng Jiaoyang could see how Shen Zhining felt towards her, and it was the same for Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>The light within Shen Zhining’s eyes looked quite calm now, and he was looking at Sheng Jiaoyang as if she was just a familiar stranger.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang slightly widened her eyes in surprise. Earlier, he had just told her not to leave him after kissing her forcefully, but now, he had chosen to let her go.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t leave now, you will never get the chance to leave again.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang immediately slipped under his arm and ran towards the door without any hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Are you really that heartless?” Shen Zhining’s slightly hoarse voice sounded from behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stopped momentarily. She did not know how to respond to the question, so she simply chose not to answer, and walked out of the door.</p> 
 <p>The bodyguards stopped her at the door.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, Lin Yan was right outside the room. He let out a sigh of relief when he saw Sheng Jiaoyang walk out. When Shen Zhining’s bodyguards stopped her, he motioned his own bodyguards forward, and both parties started ganging up on each other once more.</p> 
 <p>As Lin Yan had fewer people with him, Sheng Jiaoyang was still being blocked by Shen Zhining’s bodyguards, and she could not make her way to Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>“Let her go.”</p> 
 <p>The bodyguards immediately stopped fighting, and those who were blocking Sheng Jiaoyang stepped aside.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao.” Lin Yan walked up and held Sheng Jiaoyang’s hands. His eyes darkened when he saw that her lips were swelling slightly.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan quickly put on a gentle smile, “Let’s go.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around, but she did not see Shen Zhining anywhere. Hence, she buried her uncertainty deep in her heart, and left with Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>When they got into their vehicle, Lin Yan asked after some hesitation, “Did… he do anything to you?”</p> 
 <p>A flash went across Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes as she recalled Shen Zhining’s kiss. She pursed her lips as she remembered how fierce the kiss was, and how her lips were almost bitten till they were on the verge of bleeding. </p> 
 <p>“Nothing much.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan was silent for a moment, before he pretended as if nothing was wrong and asked nonchalantly, “What did you guys talk about then? Why did he let you out?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m also wondering about that. It doesn’t make sense.” For some reason, Sheng Jiaoyang did not want to keep talking about this topic.</p> 
 <p>Instead, she turned around and asked him, “What happened during the past two years? I feel that he’s not the same person that I remember him to be.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s smile stiffened, “It’s better if you don’t know about those unhappy incidents. From now on, let’s just live happily together, and not care about others.”</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang heard him mention the 'unhappy incidents', she remembered that her memory loss was caused by Lin Yan. <em>What exactly happened that made her so unhappy?</em></p> 
 <p>She remembered Lin Yan had mentioned that Shen Zhining was the one who forcefully got in between them. However, she definitely remembered that Shen Zhining did not have such feelings for her in the past. Otherwise, with his strong character, he would have acted on his feelings and interfered in her relationship with Lin Yan much earlier.</p> 
 <p>Something must have happened in the past two years to cause Shen Zhining to develop feelings for her, and intervene in their relationship.</p> 
 <p>“Where are we heading to now? Back to Mr. Sven’s manor?” Sheng Jiaoyang sensed that Lin Yan did not wish to harp on the current topic anymore, so she changed the conversation topic.</p> 
 <p>“We’re not going there, we’re heading home,” Lin Yan smiled lightly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laid her eyes on the bruise at the corner of his mouth. “Does it still hurt? When we get back, let’s massage it with a hard-boiled egg.”</p> 
 <p>“It hurts, but with you beside me, it doesn’t hurt anymore,” Lin Yan said affectionately.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled, but deep down in her heart, she did not feel anything special. It was almost as if she had already become immune to Lin Yan’s affections.</p> 
 <p>The home that Lin Yan mentioned was a place where Sheng Jiaoyang had once been to.</p> 
 <p>They arrived home just in time for dinner.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s mother, Lin Xuejun, was having dinner by herself.</p> 
 <p>When she saw Lin Yan walk in with Sheng Jiaoyang, her face was filled with astonishment.</p> 
 <p>“You guys…” Lin Xuejun’s gaze bounced rapidly between the two of them.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan held Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand and walked before Lin Xuejun, “Jiaojiao is my girlfriend now.”</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t she have a boyfriend? ” Although Lin Xuejun’s tone was gentle, it carried a clear hint of doubt.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stumped when she heard her words. Her intuition told her that the boyfriend that Aunt Lin was referring to was Shen Zhining. Suddenly, she recalled a tiny detail. </p> 
 <p>Earlier today, when she went to visit Lina, Lina had asked her if she still remembered Shen Zhining. It seemed that she was about to say that Shen Zhining was her boyfriend, but Lin Yan suddenly raised his voice and cut her off.</p> 
 <p>After she remembered this tiny detail, she suddenly recalled the way Shen Zhining looked at her earlier.</p> 
 <p>The current Shen Zhining was drastically different from the person in her memory. He was now much more restrained than before. Though he still had a strong character, he had restrained himself when he was facing her. Otherwise, he would not have let her go eventually.</p> 
 <p>When Lin Yan saw Sheng Jiaoyang’s thoughtful expression, the muscles on his face became taut, and he said, “It’s all in the past. I am the person that Jiaojiao really likes, and we should have been together right from the start.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun smiled softly, “Have you guys had dinner? Come, let’s have dinner together.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan pulled out a chair for Sheng Jiaoyang, and he sat down beside her, “Is Father not back yet?”</p> 
 <p>“He has a meeting.” The smile on Lin Xuejun’s face became less radiant.</p> 
 <p>A hint of ridicule flashed through Lin Yan’s eyes. <em>That father of mine must be enjoying his time with some other woman.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was troubled by the matters in her heart, and thus, she did not have much appetite. She was done with the meal after a few bites.</p> 
 <p>“Is the food not to your liking?” Lin Yan asked with great concern. </p> 
 <p>“I’m just a bit tired.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan stood up and reached out to Sheng Jiaoyang, “I’ll bring you up to rest.”</p>
