<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Mingyue, what are you looking at?” Pan Zihui asked.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue stuck out her tongue in embarrassment before turning to say to Lina, “I’m sorry Lina, I wasn’t trying to slander you or gossip about you. Somebody else said that you were…that type.” </p> 
 <p>The hurriedly texting Li Yu had also noticed Pan Mingyue’s shout just now and set aside his phone. “What happened?” </p> 
 <p>“I also don’t know. Let me ask somebody.” Pan Mingyue found the commentator that had said Lina was gay and called to ask. </p> 
 <p>She soon understood what was going on. </p> 
 <p>It was actually a rumour originating from a post on a popular forum website. There were several pictures of Lina and another woman chatting, and people were using that as ‘evidence’ to make allegations against Lina. </p> 
 <p>Right now, the rumour was already on the top search list. </p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue suddenly stared at Sheng Jiaoyang. “Oh! You’re the person in the picture that came out as gay.” </p> 
 <p><em>Came out?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang and Lina looked at each other strangely, a small smile appearing in their eyes. </p> 
 <p>As they watched the pair’s small, habitual movements, those who originally didn’t believe in the rumour were starting to be skeptical. </p> 
 <p>“Lina, do you two really have that kind of relationship?” Pan Mingyue curiously asked, a trace of doubt in her voice. </p> 
 <p>“What do you think?” Lina raised her brows, asking with a strange smile. </p> 
 <p><em>Yes!</em> Pan Mingyue thought. “I don’t know, but you two look like you are very close!” </p> 
 <p>Li Yu felt his head hurt as he looked at Sheng Jiaoyang. She’d just signed on, yet she was already causing such big scandals. If it was just a scandal, then it’d be fine, but with what he was currently seeing, it would be troublesome if it was actually real. </p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui’s expression also wasn’t great. This girl, who was very likely his daughter, was being called a homosexual with another girl. It made him feel as if he’d lost all dignity. </p> 
 <p>The food arrived. </p> 
 <p>Apart from the main stars of the scandal, nobody had much of an appetite. </p> 
 <p>After the meal, Li Yu called Sheng Jiaoyang to talk alone for a while. </p> 
 <p>“Are you and Lina really in that kind of relationship?” Li Yu asked, his tone serious. </p> 
 <p>“What kind of relationship?” Sheng Jiaoyang’s tone was lukewarm and exasperatingly slow. </p> 
 <p>“A homosexual relationship!” Li Yu looked at her sternly. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips lifted in a grin. “Nope.”</p> 
 <p>Li Yu’s tone softened when he saw she didn’t seem to be lying. “I’ll call the public relations department to take care of this. In the meantime, don’t be too close with Lina.” </p> 
 <p>“Can’t do that.” </p> 
 <p>Li Yu frowned as he looked at Sheng Jiaoyang. His boss had only said to make sure she signs on, no matter what. He hadn’t said that he needed to make her popular. However, he couldn’t just spend so much money and wreck the company’s salary framework just to bring a pretty face back. She’s already ruined her reputation! How would she ever be able to earn back all the money he’d spent on her?</p> 
 <p>“Then, let’s do this. I’ll call Gu Zhou’s manager, and later, we’ll create another scandal between the two of you. Be prepared.” </p> 
 <p><em>Gu Zhou again?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes narrowed. </p> 
 <p>Li Yu laughed as he watched Sheng Jiaoyang’s face change slightly. “You aren’t willing to be in a scandal with Gu Zhou?” </p> 
 <p>“Is there anybody else?”</p> 
 <p>“Who do you want instead?” </p> 
 <p>“Can’t you give me some good looking pretty boy or something?” </p> 
 <p>“…” <em>Pft!</em></p> 
 <p>Li Yu felt a strange sense of pity for Gu Zhou. The girl meant that Gu Zhou wasn’t ‘good looking’ and also wasn’t a ‘pretty boy’. It was simply…</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou would probably cry if he heard that. </p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
