 <p>"Jiaojiao." Lin Yan walked over.</p> 
 <p>When Jerry saw Lin Yan come over, he raised an eyebrow and greeted him with interest, "Hi, Lina’s brother."</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan remained smiling as he nodded slightly in response. Then, he looked at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, "Didn't Mr. Shen come today?"</p> 
 <p>"He is staying at home and looking after our child." She looked at the stunned expression on Lin Yan’s face and couldn’t stop herself from smiling as she pictured the merry scene in her mind.</p> 
 <p>"What are you guys talking about?" Jerry chimed in.</p> 
 <p>A thought popped up in Sheng Jiaoyang’s mind, and she replied in Italian, "He was asking why my husband didn’t come with me." </p> 
 <p>"You're married?" Jerry was surprised, but he soon rejected the thought. "No way, how could a married lady be a bridesmaid?"</p> 
 <p>"I’m not married yet, but he's the one I have set my mind on. We're going to get married early next year," Sheng Jiaoyang explained.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan's gaze darkened. Even though he said that he’d already let go of his feelings, he still felt a dull pain in his heart when he heard those words.</p> 
 <p>"Oh, so you’re not married yet. Well, it wouldn’t matter even if you were married. I heard that Sven snatched the bride from the man who came today," Jerry said with a look of indifference.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's brows twitched. She really wanted to give Jerry a ferocious kick.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Ewan, you can leave your frivolous flirting for others. There are some people you just can't flirt with." Lin Yan was no longer smiling.</p> 
 <p>Jerry looked at Lin Yan. "This is the second time I've heard this today. But, I insist on chasing Jiao. What can you do to me?"</p> 
 <p>As he said that, Jerry rolled up his sleeves and revealed his sturdy arms. Anyone who saw those sturdy muscles would know that he was somebody who worked out frequently.</p> 
 <p>"Let's go. Don’t bother with him." Sheng Jiaoyang dragged Lin Yan away.</p> 
 <p>"Come on, let's exchange some blows. Whoever wins will have the right to speak." Jerry ran forward eagerly.</p> 
 <p>"Does Mr. Ewan solve things by force?"</p> 
 <p>"If you can fight, then stop babbling. Let’s resolve this in a straightforward manner. Come on, let's fight first, and talk later." Jerry even unbuttoned his upper buttons, and he looked like he was ready to fight hard.</p> 
 <p>There were indeed all kinds of weirdos in this world. Sheng Jiaoyang had to admit that Jerry was the weirdest amongst the weirdos. He was already a grown up, but his manners were still so simple and crude. It seemed that only someone with a background like his would dare to act in such an unruly manner. Otherwise, if ordinary people were to act like that, they would have been detained by the police long ago.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stood between the two guys, and she cast a cold glance at Jerry. "Today is Sven's wedding. Do you want to stir trouble on his wedding day?"</p> 
 <p>"No, I'm not stirring trouble. I'm just comparing our skills through a friendly competition during our leisure time. Come on, if you’re a man, stop hiding behind a woman and step forward bravely." Jerry looked at Lin Yan provocatively.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan's eyelids twitched. Their current scenario was like a scholar running into a soldier. Facing a barbarian like Jerry who only wanted to fight made things difficult for him. Jerry Ewan had a lot of authority behind him. Otherwise, he couldn’t possibly be friends with Sven. Most importantly, he was certainly no match for Jerry, because he rarely worked out.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn't get out of the way. Instead, she provocatively retorted, "Do you think everyone is like you, with a well-developed body but a simple brain? If you’re so capable, stop trying to start a fight and compete in something else instead." </p> 
 <p>"Compete in what?" Jerry asked.</p> 
 <p>"Playing cards. Do you dare?" Sheng Jiaoyang raised her chin at him.</p> 
 <p>Jerry was going to agree, but when he saw how fearless Sheng Jiaoyang was, he immediately changed his mind. "I think it's more straightforward to have a fight."</p> 
 <p>"…As expected from a musclebrain. Do you dare to compete in something else?"</p> 
 <p>"Since it's a competition, of course it's better to compete in something that I’m good at. Otherwise, what should I compete in? Let's just fight!" Jerry grinned like a ruffian.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt her head spin. <em>My attempts to agitate him actually didn't work!</em> When she encountered someone like Jerry, who had a one-track mind, she didn’t know how to begin her verbal attacks, and all her words appeared to have lost their offensive power.</p> 
 <p>"I don't want to talk to you." Sheng Jiaoyang turned around, and she was just about to leave when she was held back by Jerry.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang halted and glanced at the hand that was holding onto her arm, before looking at Jerry. "What? You want to use force against a lady?"</p> 
 <p>Jerry immediately let go of her hand. "No way, I'm a gentleman."</p> 
 <p>"Gentleman? Hah!" Sheng Jiaoyang sneered.</p> 
 <p>"Alright, I won't fight him." Jerry looked at Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>Just when Sheng Jiaoyang thought this guy had given up, Jerry said, "Call your boyfriend over, and I'll fight him."</p> 
 <p>"You want to fight me?" </p> 
 <p>"I won't fight you. I'll only fight Jiao's boyfriend," Jerry replied without a second thought.</p> 
 <p>The corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched. She raised her hand and pointed behind Jerry. "He is my darling."</p> 
 <p>Jerry turned and stared at the man with a look of surprise. "It’s you?!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was also surprised. She swept another glance at Jerry, before shifting her gaze to Shen Zhining, who was approaching them in a leisurely manner. She asked, "Do you know each other?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining glanced at Jerry before replying in English, "He’s someone I defeated before." </p> 
 <p>Jerry’s expression turned grouchy. He then turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang as he said to Shen Zhining, "Let's compete again. If you lose today, you will break up with her!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining lowered his lashes, and his gaze became darker. The look in his eyes was cold, but his lips were curled upwards. "I'm afraid that after I pummel you, not even your parents would be able to recognize you when you get home. I hope they won’t blame me for not stopping you from starting a fight."</p> 
 <p>Jerry held up his fist and showed off his biceps. He then fiercely said, "I'm going to turn you into a loser this time!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang walked over to Shen Zhining and whispered, "Sven said that this guy is quite proficient in mixed martial arts. Look at those sturdy muscles. He must train a lot normally. Are you sure about this?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang and replied in a low voice, "What if I lose?"</p> 
 <p>"It's alright. I'll find a chance to trap him in a sack and beat him up to avenge you!" Sheng Jiaoyang immediately replied.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining chuckled with a gentle smile on his face. He lifted Sheng Jiaoyang's chin and kissed her. He glanced at the two men from the corner of his eye and loudly declared, "Don't worry. Your darling won’t lose."</p> 
 <p>"Don't overestimate yourself. I'm not the same person from back then. I'm sure I can beat you today," Jerry stated confidently.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining removed his coat and placed it in Sheng Jiaoyang’s arms. He then leisurely rolled up his cuffs.</p> 
 <p>"Come on…" Jerry was about to urge him when Shen Zhining’s fist flew over.</p> 
 <p>Jerry was knocked back a few steps. He wiped the corner of his mouth and glared at Shen Zhining ferociously. "You attacked me before you announced that the fight started. You’re not following the rules!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wriggled his wrist and sneered, "Fights have always been something that is not restricted by rules.."</p> 
 <p>"…" Jerry was speechless. However, his strength had been awakened by the punch he received, and he rushed forth to return the blow.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Lin Yan have long dodged aside, and they watched them fight from the sidelines.</p> 
 <p>To put it nicely, it was a fight, but it was a completely one-sided fight. Shen Zhining was already familiar with Jerry's way of fighting, so he could predict the latter’s moves and return his blows. However, Jerry only relied on his instincts to fight. Sometimes, he even missed his blows and left himself open for his opponent.</p> 
 <p><em>Bam!</em> Jerry was knocked down again by Shen Zhining’s fist.</p> 
 <p>Jerry's face was already unrecognizable. Shen Zhining obviously targeted his face on purpose, and he nearly beat it into a pig's head.</p> 
 <p>"Stop!" Jerry finally couldn't help but shout to stop.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stood still and looked down at Jerry. "Want to admit defeat?"</p> 
 <p>"Fighting alone doesn't prove anything. If you are so capable, let’s compete in something else." Jerry leaned against the wall, gasping heavily.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but chuckle when she heard his words. <em>Looks like the situation has been reversed. Hmmm, his words sounded quite familiar!</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wriggled his wrist before he calmly asked Jerry, "What do you want to compete in?"</p> 
 <p>"Let’s have a shooting competition if you dare!" Jerry looked up with confidence. He played with guns every day as it was a part of his job, so it was impossible for him to lose.</p> 
 <p>"Didn't you say that fighting was the most straightforward thing to compete in? Now, it seems that you're obviously not good at fighting, so you start talking about something else. Who was the person who couldn’t stop blabbering about having a fight earlier?" Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Jerry with a slight smile.</p> 
 <p>Jerry brazenly replied, "The fight was just a warm-up."</p> 
 <p>It turned out that if someone didn't have a smart brain, they couldn't do anything right.</p> 
 <p>They moved to the shooting range. Originally, Jerry wanted to show off, so that he could wash off his disgrace from earlier.</p> 
 <p>But in the end…</p> 
 <p>He suffered a crushing defeat.</p> 
 <p>In terms of reaction time and decisiveness, he was not as good as Shen Zhining, so he was pinned down in the fight. He didn’t even have the chance to shoot at the target.</p> 
 <p>Finally, when Jerry was about to leave with a crestfallen expression, he was stopped by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Jerry, with a red and swollen face, looked at Shen Zhining miserably and asked, "What else do you want?"</p> 
 <p>"Earlier, you said that if I lose, I must break up with my woman. So now, I have the right to make a request as the winner, right?" Shen Zhining stared at Jerry.</p> 
 <p>The look on Jerry’s face changed greatly, "Then, what do you want? Let me make it clear, you can’t request for anything that’s too overboard!"</p> 
 <p>"Don't worry. My request is not as overboard as yours."</p> 
 <p>"…Then go ahead. As long as I can accomplish it, I will do it. "</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining, on the other hand, glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang. He obviously wanted Sheng Jiaoyang to make the request.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought for a moment before she blurted out what she had in mind, "You can definitely accomplish this. My request is for you to make a detour whenever you see me in the future. At times, when you find that it is impossible to make a detour around me, you'll have to call me Big Sis!"</p> 
 <p>Like this, the troublesome Jerry was directly shooed away, and he wouldn’t dare flirt with her again in the future.</p> 
 <p>When Jerry left, he finally realized why Sven advised him not to flirt with her. As a result, it was his own fault for getting beaten, and he had no one to blame.</p> 
 <p>"You were so awesome!" Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining with sparkling eyes.</p> 
 <p>Apart from the one time when they were young when she had witnessed Shen Zhining step on someone, she had never seen Shen Zhining fight. The time he beat Lin Yan at the gate of Sven's manor didn’t count, as back then, her mood was totally different.</p> 
 <p>When Shen Zhining beat Jerry until the latter shouted out to surrender, she didn’t think that Shen Zhining was ferocious at all. On the contrary, her heart skipped a beat. <em>Shen Zhining was so manly earlier!</em></p> 
 <p><em>It’s such a waste to let him stay home and take care of Xiao An. It would be better to keep him at my side in the future.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang secretly thought.</p> 
 <p>"Have you finished attending to your matters?" Shen Zhining's expression remained calm when he heard the praise.</p> 
 <p>"Yep." Sheng Jiaoyang nodded repeatedly.</p> 
 <p>"Let’s go home."</p> 
 <p>"Alright!"</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan, who originally wanted to walk over and say a few words to them, was left behind in the same spot. As he stared at the figures of the two walking arm in arm, he felt…</p>
