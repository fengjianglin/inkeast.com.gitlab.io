<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was awoken by the tingling sensation of being pricked by a needle. When she opened her eyes, she saw that a person in a white coat was taking her blood.</p> 
 <p>Instantly, her heart started thumping loudly, and it dawned on her that she was in trouble.</p> 
 <p>Having reached this point, it wouldn’t matter how hard she screamed. She just watched the man in the white coat draw out a tube of her blood in silence before pulling the syringe out.</p> 
 <p>She was in a room with walls on all sides. There was a ventilation hole in a corner of one of the walls, but the ventilation was pitifully small. She estimated that only a baby could squeeze in there. If she wanted to go out, she had to pass through the main entrance.</p> 
 <p>Also, she was tied to a chair.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it! Which horrible person is responsible for this!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang racked her brain for a while, but she couldn’t think of who she’d offended that would go to the trouble of kidnapping her.</p> 
 <p><em>Why were they taking her blood? What will they do with it?</em></p> 
 <p>But, she was now alone in the room. No one could answer her question, so she had no other choice but to wait.</p> 
 <p>As time stretched from seconds to minutes, no one came, and her anxiety grew.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, two people were sitting in the surveillance room next door.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Nan, you’re still as simple and cruel as always!” the man lamented as he pushed his glasses higher up his nose.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan didn’t respond and only shot a glance at the man by his side that talked too much.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you ask Dr. Liu to check her just then? She hasn’t had any plastic surgery done, so why did you take her blood to be tested? Isn’t it too much to treat a girl like this? What if Xu Jiaojiao is wronged?”</p> 
 <p>“Even if I wrong someone, it’s none of your business,” Jing Weinan said indifferently.</p> 
 <p><em>They were planning to wrong her? That poor innocent soul! Sigh, that girl was really unlucky to run into these ruthless people.</em></p> 
 <p>The corner of Ning Xiaoruan’s mouth twitched.</p> 
 <p>“That girl is quite calm meeting this kind of trouble. She isn’t screaming or crying, and she doesn’t look scared either,” Ning Xiaoruan commented as he watched the scene on the monitor.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan calmly said, “This shows that she’s problematic.”</p> 
 <p>This time, Ning Xiaoruan didn’t oppose him. He even said in acknowledgement, “Yeah, normally a girl of her age would be frightened and start to cry when experiencing this kind of thing.”</p> 
 <p>“That girl couldn’t be a spy, right? Her psychological state is really good.” Ning Xiaoruan clicked his tongue in wonder.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, of course, wasn’t a spy. Her innocent self was inexplicably knocked out by someone and brought to this secluded place.</p> 
 <p>She recalled that since she’d become Xu Jiaojiao, the person that she’d most offended was Qi Hua. But, the way that girl would retaliate against her would be to suppress her career behind the scenes.</p> 
 <p>Is it possible that it was Xu Jiaojiao’s blood father who set this up? Otherwise, who else would be so idle as to take her blood.</p> 
 <p>Even after waiting until her hands and feet were numb, she still hadn’t seen anyone come. Sheng Jiaoyang was furious.</p> 
 <p>She looked around and said, “Come out if you have an issue with me. Don’t hide.”</p> 
 <p>In the surveillance room next door, Ning Xiaoruan laughed. “That girl finally can’t take it anymore.”</p> 
 <p>“Brother Nan, Dr. Liu has already examined her, and she is indeed Xu Jiaojiao. What do we need to do next?”</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan shot a glance at Ning Xiaoruan, then stood up and left the room.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, wait for me!” Ning Xiaoruan hurriedly left the room to catch up to him.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang saw the two men entering, she stared in surprise.</p> 
 <p>Although she constantly avoided Demon King Shen, she could still recognise the two men who were always by his side. Especially that fool Ning Xiaoruan. She’d met him when she’d accompanied her grandfather to attend the birthday banquet of Elder Shen. She’d also seen him on several other occasions, and she knew that he was a cousin of Demon King Shen.</p> 
 <p>One was the trusted assistant of the Demon King, and the other was his cousin.</p> 
 <p>If she still didn’t know which damnable fool had kidnapped her, she should just be a pig.</p> 
 <p>As expected, nothing good happened whenever she met the Demon King. She’d changed into another person, yet bad luck still befell her.</p> 
 <p>“Speak! Who did you contact before?” Jing Weinan got right to the point and said.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” Sheng Jiaoyang’s brow knitted, and she felt that the question was somewhat baffling.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan’s expression darkened, and with his large height, it was quite intimidating. “Don’t act like you’re all confused in front of me!”</p> 
 <p>“Spit it out! Tell me clearly.”</p> 
 <p>“What my Brother Nan means is: What instructions did the person you’re in contact with give to you, in regards to getting close to President Shen?” Ning Xiaoruan said.</p> 
 <p>“President Shen? Are you talking about Shen Zhining?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at them like they were crazy.</p> 
 <p>“Hoo, she even knows his name.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you stupid? How could I approach him? Which eyes of yours saw me approaching him?!” Sheng Jiaoyang exploded. She was tied up here because of this non-existent matter. She really wanted to tie them up and thrash them fiercely with a whip.</p> 
 <p>“Words alone aren’t proof,” Jing Weinan stubbornly said.</p> 
 <p>_…F_ck!*</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang started grinding her teeth, and with a great effort, she tried to suppress her fury and said, “Then, what evidence do you have to prove that I'm approaching him?”</p> 
 <p>“You’ve appeared around our President Shen twice. Most importantly, you’re also trying to imitate Jiaoyang,” said Ning Xiaoruan.</p> 
 <p><em>I’m imitating myself now?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang sneered. But, at the moment, she really couldn’t tell them her identity. These people who doubted her had decided that she was an imposter. Moreover, she couldn’t let anyone know about her becoming another person.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaoyang is my idol. I admire her, so why can’t I imitate her?” Sheng Jiaoyang rolled her eyes, immediately giving an excuse.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaoyang isn’t a celebrity. How did you find out about her?” Ning Xiaoruan asked curiously.</p> 
 <p>“When I was little, I had a dream of becoming a painter, but other people didn’t know about it. Later, I stumbled upon a post on the Internet. The poster had attended an art exhibit and posted several photos taken at the exhibition. Those paintings were truly marvellous. With a glance, I fell in love with the bold, imaginative, and unrestrained art style. Afterwards, I read that the art exhibition was inaugurated by a girl who was only a few years older than me. From that moment on, I started respecting her as my idol, and I started to secretly imitate her paintings, pursue her art style, and preferences. I just admire her, so what? Who said that I can’t imitate my idol?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smoothly lied with a straight expression. Moreover, her tone of voice was filled with excitement, which made it seem like she really was just an avid fan who was questioned about her love towards her idol.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t care whether there were loopholes in her story. Anyway, many things couldn’t be investigated at all. She really wanted to see if they had the ability to uncover all of Xu Jiaojiao’s online records for the past few years!</p> 
 <p>“Then, why didn’t you show it before?” Jing Weinan asked, unmoved.</p> 
 <p>“It was only when I woke up at the hospital that I learnt that my idol was sent to the hospital at the same time as me. I felt really guilty for sending her to the hospital, and from then on, I decided to become a person like her.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused before suddenly shouting, “How long do you want to keep me tied up for?! I’ll tell you clearly; I’ll never approach your President Shen. Why would I get close to a person that even Jiaoyang didn’t like?! Hurry up and release me. My mother is waiting for me!”</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan laughed as he said, “Don’t worry, I used your phone to send a message to your mother. I told her you and your friend are hanging out together, and she should go home without waiting for you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, there was the sound of a phone ringing. Jing Weinan glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang before he pulled out his phone and went to the side to answer the call.</p> 
 <p>“Let her go,” came a deep voice on the phone. “By the way, ask her…how she knows that Jiaoyang didn’t like me.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes.” Astonishment flashed across Jing Weinan’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Ning Xiaoruan asked.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan didn’t answer. Instead, he just walked over and released Sheng Jiaoyang’s restraints. When she stood up and stretched her body, he asked, “How did you know that Miss Jiaoyang didn’t like our Boss?”</p> 
 <p>“I just know, but why should I tell you?” From Jing Weinan’s actions, Sheng Jiaoyang deduced that she was fine now. At that moment, the fire in her heart lit up once more.</p> 
 <p>“You’re not afraid that I won’t send you back?” Jing Weinan asked with a poker face.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t bother! I have feet, so I can walk on my own.” Sheng Jiaoyang harrumphed before turning around to leave.</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan couldn’t help but gloat at Jing Weinan being browbeaten and sent him a glance filled with schadenfreude before trailing behind Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“We’re in the outskirts of the city, and it’s late at night. Let Big Brother send you back, okay?”</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, he leaned close to her and whispered, “Later, tell me how you know that Jiaoyang didn’t like my cousin. Oh, I forgot to say, my cousin is President Shen.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Ning Xiaoruan in disapproval before she replied, “Send me home first, then I’ll tell you.”</p> 
 <p>“Then, you must tell me later!” Ning Xiaoruan winked at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>The corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched. <em>He’s really such a fool!</em></p>
