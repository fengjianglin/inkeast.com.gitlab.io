 <p>The man pinned Lina down on the bed. Just when he was about to kiss her, Lina suddenly turned her face away from him.</p>
 <p>However, the man simply grabbed her chin and roughly forced her to face him, before moving in to bite her lips vengefully.</p>
 <p>Lina frowned at the stab of pain from his bite, but she clenched her jaw and refused to let his tongue enter her mouth.</p>
 <p>After realising that his tongue couldn’t penetrate her tightly sealed lips, he licked the spot that he had just nibbled on, before deciding to attack some other spot on her body.</p>
 <p>He slowly moved downward, from her lips, to her chin, to her long and slender neck. Then, he used his teeth to gently nibble at her delicate collar bones, before he started moving down again…</p>
 <p>Lina lifted her hand to push him away and said, “Just get to it already!”</p>
 <p>The man grabbed her hand and pinned it above her head. Then, with sparks of excitement leaping in his dark brown eyes, he stared straight into her and growled hoarsely, “Darling, I’m afraid that I’ll hurt you.”</p>
 <p>Lina looked at him like he was a scoundrel, before shutting her eyes and scolding him with a distraught voice, “Don’t call me darling. I’m not your darling.”</p>
 <p>“Very soon…” He licked her delicious lips, “Soon, you will become my darling.”</p>
 <p><em>Bastard!</em> Lina bit her lips and ignored the tingling feeling rushing up her spine.</p>
 <p>“Darling, you’re really beautiful.”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“Darling, your body is thirsting for mine. Can you feel it?”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“Darling…”</p>
 <p>“If you want to do it, then hurry up! Stop speaking so much nonsense!”</p>
 <p>Lina felt like she was about to crumble. Even in George’s most tender and gentle moments, he didn’t act so slowly. Her heart was already suffering to begin with, and yet she had to listen to all the rubbish he was spouting. If she wasn’t being pinned down right now, she would’ve taken over and got it done and over with.</p>
 <p>The man blinked, and a soft smile appeared in his eyes as he gently licked her ear. He could feel her body turning even softer, and with a hint of ridicule in his voice, he laughed and said, “If you want me to go faster, then call out my name gently.”</p>
 <p>Lina bit down on her lip and refused to speak.</p>
 <p>She opened her eyes slightly and looked at the man mockingly. <em>This is just a business deal, so why would she do more than the bare minimum?!</em></p>
 <p>The man’s expression turned darker, and the corner of his lips curled up into a demonic smile. Then, he whispered, with a voice that was so intimate that it sounded like the gentle caress of a close lover, “It’s fine if you don’t want to. In any case, you’re already mine.”</p>
 <p>“So let us fall into depravity together… alright, Darling?”</p>
 <p>Lina gave a muffled moan, and she clenched her hands that were being pinned above her head into fists.</p>
 <p>“Darling, you’re so soft and sensitive,” the man sighed as if he was appreciating an exquisite dish.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>Lina tried to endure his nonsense, but ultimately couldn’t help but scold out, “Sven, are you a man or not? Stop talking so much!”</p>
 <p>“Hehe!”</p>
 <p>Sven let go of her wrists and moved his hand down to caress her slender waist instead.</p>
 <p>“As you wish, Darling.”</p>
 <p>Lina almost cried out, but she bit down on her lips harshly. She refused to let a sound out, despite the pleasurable sensations.</p>
 <p>She felt like she was on a small boat that was lost in the rampaging ocean. The waves constantly battered against her boat and rocked her back and forth precariously. She was constantly on edge, wondering when she might capsize. Worst still, she did not know when she could return to shore.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, she felt that she was drifting on an ocean of flames, constantly having to withstand scorching pain and torture. She didn’t want to endure such pain, and the only thing in her mind was the thought of turning into ashes, so that her suffering could end sooner.</p>
 <p>Time slowly passed by.</p>
 <p>In the end, the big wave that would capsize her boat never came.</p>
 <p>“Are… you… done… yet….” Her shaky voice was punctuated by her exhausted panting.</p>
 <p>“I’m not done yet. Far from it. Darling, I will keep going until I collapse on you…” With that, he shoved his tongue into her slightly parted lips.</p>
 <p>Bright neon lights illuminated the night sky outside the window, creating a beautiful view. However, the two were naturally too busy to notice this beauty.</p>
 <p>With her tired and weak arms, she tried futilely to push him away, “Stop… I… can’t take it anymore…”</p>
 <p>“Babe, if you call me darling, I’ll let you rest.”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“It seems you don’t want to rest…”</p>
 <p>“…Darling…. Ah!!!” He ruthlessly thrust into her again.</p>
 <p>“You!”</p>
 <p>“Sorry Darling, I was too excited.”</p>
 <p>“Scram ngg…”</p>
 <p>The temperature was clearly constant, but the room seemed to be getting hotter and hotter.</p>
 <p>One of them was very passionate, but the other had a heart of ice.</p>
 <p>After watching a lot of CCTV footage, Sheng Jiaoyang finally discovered the car’s location. However, when she saw where the car was at, her heart sank.</p>
 <p><em>A hotel…</em></p>
 <p><em>Lina went to a hotel with a man…</em></p>
 <p>She didn’t dare to think any further.</p>
 <p>After confirming the location of the hotel, Sheng Jiaoyang rushed over there with her bodyguards.</p>
 <p>The receptionist naturally wouldn’t easily leak out a guest’s information.</p>
 <p>Hence, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t run up to the receptionist and start questioning her. She pondered over it and came to the conclusion that somebody who could afford luxury cars and bodyguards would definitely pick the best room in the hotel. Thus, she booked a presidential suite and went up with her bodyguards.</p>
 <p>When she got to the top floor, she didn’t even need to look for them. When she saw that there were two bodyguards standing outside one of the rooms, she instantly knew that this was the room that they were in.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” The bodyguards saw them approaching aggressively and raised their guard.</p>
 <p>When she heard the wariness behind the bodyguard’s voice, a person appeared in Sheng Jiaoyang’s mind.</p>
 <p><em>Could it be Sven? The one who’s always pestering Lina?</em></p>
 <p>“I want to see your employer.” Sheng Jiaoyang intentionally spoke in Mandarin.</p>
 <p>The bodyguards didn’t loosen his guard when he heard his native language. Instead, they looked at Sheng Jiaoyang with curiosity in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“You should come back tomorrow,” one of the bodyguards replied.</p>
 <p><em>It would be too late if she comes back tomorrow.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly smiled, “Sven wouldn’t be doing intimate things with that woman, right?”</p>
 <p>The bodyguards became even more curious. They seemed to be very interested in the relationship between Sheng Jiaoyang and their employer.</p>
 <p>“I have something important that I have to discuss with Sven right now.” Sheng Jiaoyang’s tone turned friendly.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, Boss said that nobody can disturb him today.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s face turned cold. She took a step back and signalled to her bodyguards.</p>
 <p>Her bodyguards immediately moved towards the bodyguards guarding the door. They noticed that something was fishy, and they decided to retaliate.</p>
 <p>Unobstructed, Sheng Jiaoyang walked to the door and pressed the doorbell.</p>
 <p>After pressing it a few times, there was still no movement inside. Hence, she grew even more worried, and started to knock frantically on the door.</p>
 <p>“Lina? Can you hear me? Sven, let Lina go now! Otherwise, I’ll report you for kidnapping!”</p>
 <p>“Mei Niu, are you alright? Can you hear me?”</p>
 <p>Her shouting and knocking was quite loud, so even if the hotel rooms had better soundproofing, it still wouldn’t be able to muffle everything. Besides, an ordinary hotel’s doors could only be so good.</p>
 <p>“Darling, your friend is here to find you. She’s so fast, looks like she has some ability.” Sven didn’t seem satisfied yet as he brushed a strand of Lina’s sweat-soaked hair behind her ear and kissed her face.</p>
 <p>Lina slowly opened her eyes, exhausted. She ignored the man and looked at the door. Then, she listened raptly for any movements.</p>
 <p>Once she heard her voice, she knew immediately that it was Sheng Jiaoyang who had come to find her.</p>
 <p>A trace of sadness and despair flashed through her eyes. If it was possible, she just wanted to find a place where she could stay alone and hide. She didn’t know how to face Sheng Jiaoyang, and she definitely couldn’t face George…</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t regret her decision. If she had to choose again, she would have still done what she did today.</p>
 <p>This happened because of her, so it should be settled by her.</p>
 <p>“Darling, do you want to see your friend?”</p>
 <p>Lina glared fiercely at Sven. In the next moment, he stood up and held her in his embrace.</p>
 <p>“What are you trying to do?” Lina asked, clearly alarmed.</p>
 <p>The corners of Sven’s lips curled up into a smile, “Letting you see your friend.”</p>
 <p>He walked to the door, stark naked.</p>
 <p>Lina gripped his shoulder tightly, “Are you crazy?!” Right now, both of them were naked and their bodies were still covered in the sweaty aftermath of their activities.</p>
 <p>The man walked to the door, and let Lina look through the peephole.</p>
 <p>Lina felt that she had no way of understanding the man’s way of thinking. She was forced to look through the peephole, and saw Sheng Jiaoyang relentlessly knocking on the door, as if she was ready to knock it down.</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao,” she called out with a hoarse voice.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stopped knocking. “Mei Niu?”</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, go back first, I…ah!”</p>
 <p>“Mei Niu, what happened to you?” When Sheng Jiaoyang heard Lina’s sudden cry, her heart was filled with sudden anxiety. She could not tell what was happening on the other side of the door.</p>
 <p>What was happening on the other side of the door was something outside of Sheng Jiaoyang’s imagination.</p>
 <p>Lina leaned on the door, and her body… was propped up by Sven’s.</p>
 <p>“Sven, you’re crazy!” Lina clenched her teeth and cursed at him quietly.</p>
 <p>Sven laughed wickedly as he leaned forward, almost burying his nose in hers. With a sudden outburst of emotion, he said, “That’s right, I’ve long become crazy for you. Come on Darling, let’s do even crazier things!”</p>
 <p>“Bastard! Get off!” Lina finally couldn’t help but curse out loudly.</p>
 <p>“Lina, what’s happening to you? Sven, open the door!” Sheng Jiaoyang heard Lina’s curse and became even more frantic. She was even slamming her own body against the door to try and break it down.</p>
 <p>“Don’t… ah…” Lina’s voice suddenly died.</p>
 <p>“Lina, Lina!” Sheng Jiaoyang was just about to get her bodyguards to break down the door when the hotel’s security came over.</p>
 <p>“Ma’am, you can’t do that. It is against the law to invade another person’s room. Besides, you’re already disturbing the rest of the guests,” the leader of the security team said seriously.</p>
 <p>“My friend is being forcibly kept there, I want to save her!” Sheng Jiaoyang stared at the security guards surrounding her without cowering.</p>
 <p>A trace of astonishment and hesitation flashed through the security guard’s eyes.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a hoarse and weak voice of a girl came from behind the door.</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, you can go back. I’m fine.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly turned to look at the door, her heart churning as she took a deep breath, “Are you sure you want me to leave?”</p>
 <p>There was a long moment of silence, before two hoarse words came in reply, “I’m sure.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang closed her eyes. Then, she pushed the security guard aside and walked away.</p>
 <p>Lina raised her head, and her face was filled with the pain that she had to endure silently. Weakly, she asked, “You… can… stop now… right?”</p>
 <p>The man laughed cheerfully and whispered in her ear, “Don’t you think you became even more sensitive when you knew that there was someone outside the door?”</p>
 <p>“…Scram!”</p>
