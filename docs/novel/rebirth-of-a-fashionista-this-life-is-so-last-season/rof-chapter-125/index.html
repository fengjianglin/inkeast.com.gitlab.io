<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hesitated slightly as she stood in front of the door, rubbing the scab on her lip. </p> 
 <p>“What are you just standing there for?” a voice asked from behind her. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes widened as she turned to face the speaker. </p> 
 <p>“I was just thinking about life,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied without blinking.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining opened the door and entered, cocking his head at her when he saw that she was still standing there. “Do you want to stand there the whole night?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly entered with her luggage.</p> 
 <p>The lights turned on. </p> 
 <p>“Did you already eat dinner?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked, regretting it as soon as she asked. </p> 
 <p>“Yeah,” Shen Zhining answered indifferently. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang released a sigh of relief after hearing his reply. If he’d said that he hadn’t eaten and she didn’t cook for him, then all her previous efforts would be wasted, never mind what would happen if she really did cook. Thankfully, he already ate outside. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining suddenly stopped and looked at her. “You seem pretty happy that I’ve already eaten. What, you don’t want to cook?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took another breath before raising her head with a big smile. “Of course, I’m happy that you ate dinner as it means you’re eating properly! You eating properly makes me happy.” </p> 
 <p>Although he didn’t know how sincere her words were, such statements were still very pleasant to the ear. Shen Zhining’s gaze became much softer.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately struck the iron while it was still hot. “Are you tired? Do you want a massage?” </p> 
 <p>“It’s fine.” Shen Zhining glanced at her and walked two steps closer. Under her nervous gaze, he picked up her luggage and helped her carry it to her room on the second floor. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stood there, stunned, as she watched him help her with the luggage. She felt almost overwhelmed with gratitude as she hurried after him. </p> 
 <p>“Sleep early,” Shen Zhining said before turning to enter his room. </p> 
 <p>“Thank you! Good night!” Sheng Jiaoyang said hurriedly. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining paused. “Good night.” He then opened the door and entered his room. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips curved as she pulled her luggage into her room. </p> 
 <p>The next day, Sheng Jiaoyang left her room and prepared to go buy breakfast. She was just about to go downstairs when she heard a door open behind her. She turned to see Shen Zhining leaving his room wearing black athletic wear. </p> 
 <p>“You’re…”</p> 
 <p>“Aren’t you going on a run?” Shen Zhining walked next to her and looked at her sunglasses and mask. “Let’s go together.”</p> 
 <p>“…Oh.” </p> 
 <p>It was only dawn when the two left the house, jogging along the road. </p> 
 <p>After running for a bit, Shen Zhining stopped to wait for her to catch her breath. </p> 
 <p>“Where do you normally go for breakfast?” he suddenly asked. </p> 
 <p>“Huh?” For a moment, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t react. </p> 
 <p>“You didn’t buy the breakfast on the table?”</p> 
 <p>How could Sheng Jiaoyang possibly dare to say that she made it? If she did, Shen Zhining would definitely make her go back to make some for him. If by any case Shen Zhining died from food poisoning, could she say he voluntarily died from poisoning?</p> 
 <p>“There’s a breakfast place over there.” Sheng Jiaoyang pointed. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised his chin, gesturing for her to lead the way. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang put on her mask and took Shen Zhining out of the neighbourhood to the restaurant. </p> 
 <p>At this time, the restaurant didn’t have a lot of customers, just the staff. </p> 
 <p>“Welcome!” the waitress greeted the two upon seeing them enter. </p> 
 <p>“What would you like today?” a waitress asked Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Shen Zhining. “What do you want to eat?” </p> 
 <p>“Just get what you usually get.” </p> 
 <p>“Then, the same as always,” Sheng Jiaoyang said to the waitress. </p> 
 <p>The waitress nodded with a smile. “Will you be dining in or is it to go? The weather is getting colder, so the food might cool easily. If you aren’t in a rush, I recommend dining in.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining again. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked around the restaurant, finding it quite clean, and nodded in agreement. </p> 
 <p>“Then, please take a seat, breakfast will be served shortly.” The waitress smiled. </p> 
 <p>Waitress B set their breakfast on the table and returned to the front desk, whispering to Waitress A, “Those two sit elegantly, like they’re eating at a fancy restaurant.” </p> 
 <p>“Don’t you think that girl looks a bit like a celebrity?” Waitress A whispered. </p> 
 <p>“A celebrity? Which celebrity?”</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao! Before, she would always wear a mask when she bought breakfast, so we couldn’t see what she looked like. However, this time, I caught a glance of her face!” Then, Waitress A left the front counter and walked over. </p> 
 <p>“Can I ask if everything’s alright and if you need anything?” Waitress A stood in front of their table. </p> 
 <p>Waitress A seized the opportunity to peek at Sheng Jiaoyang and recognition crossed her face. After being refused, she went back to the front counter. “It’s her!”</p> 
 <p>“Wah! She really is a celebrity!”</p> 
 <p>“Then, that must definitely be her boyfriend! Before, it was always her buying breakfast alone, but today, she brought somebody with her. How romantic~”</p> 
 <p>“Her boyfriend is so handsome! His mannerisms get full marks!” </p> 
 <p>The two waitresses whispered to each other. </p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang went to pay the bill, the waitress praised them, “You two look so good together!”</p> 
 <p>“…Thank you.” Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression was a bit strange. Thankfully, she was wearing a mask, so the waitress couldn’t see her reaction. </p> 
 <p>After returning to the house, Sheng Jiaoyang said to Shen Zhining, “I’m going to the film crew to fix some scenes today. I’m not sure when I’ll return, so you should eat out again tonight.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining glanced at her and replied with an, “Mhmm.” Then, he returned to his room. </p> 
 <p>Receiving the cold shoulder did not bother Sheng Jiaoyang at all. Even though Shen Zhining’s attitude towards her had gotten a lot better compared to before, she never thought that the peaceful co-existence they shared right now would’ve even been possible. It was worth the effort she’d spent on him in the past.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also returned to her room to tidy up a bit and do her makeup, especially using lip gloss to hide the scar on her lip. After Zeng Huan arrived to pick her up, she grabbed her bag and left the house. </p> 
 <p>“Sis Ping, you’re here too,” Sheng Jiaoyang said, glancing at Xu Ping sitting in the front passenger seat. </p> 
 <p>“I want to go see the crew with you. Do you mind?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course not.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled. </p> 
 <p>After meeting with the director, Sheng Jiaoyang took the initiative to introduce Wan Youfang to her manager. </p> 
 <p>“Hey, why didn’t you bring that male assistant today?” Director Wan asked. </p> 
 <p>“I was worried that he’d get in the way, so I sent him away today. Of course, if you want him here, I can call him over!” Sheng Jiaoyang joked. </p> 
 <p>“No need, he’s broken enough of my props.” Director Wan waved his hand. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled. Earlier, Ning Xiaoruan was bored while waiting for her and had wanted to help the crew out by organising the props. As a result, many props were damaged due to his curiosity. </p> 
 <p>After her makeup was done and they’d fixed the scenes, the day was almost over. </p> 
 <p>“Alright, you’re done for today. Just be prepared, we’ll be promoting it next month and you’ll have to do some publicity events for it. Of course, your studies are important, so for now, I won’t make you do all of them. When the time comes, I’ll give your manager the itinerary,” Director Wan said after calling Sheng Jiaoyang over. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded in agreement. “Director, don’t leave me out of the wrap party.” </p> 
 <p>“You’re the female lead! You wouldn’t be left out, no matter what!” Director Wan laughed. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao!” Zeng Huan ran up. </p> 
 <p>“What happened?” Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at her.</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan glanced at Director Wan and moved closer to her to whisper, “Mr Shen is here.”</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
