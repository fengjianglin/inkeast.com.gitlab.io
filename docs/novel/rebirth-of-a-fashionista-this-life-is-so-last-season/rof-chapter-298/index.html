 <p>After the lunch banquet, Prince Wight hosted another party for the young adults.</p> 
 <p>Without their elders there, everybody played and danced freely while downing wine. They danced along to the beat of the music, creating a lively scene.</p> 
 <p>However, Shen Zhining was standing in a corner where there was no one around.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang knew about his relationships. It wasn’t that nobody came to chat with him, but that they would only chat for a sentence or two before leaving. Nobody stayed with him. Even Jarett had gone off to flirt with the ladies.</p> 
 <p>“Do you want to join in?” Shen Zhining saw that Sheng Jiaoyang was glancing around.</p> 
 <p>“Nah, there’s nothing fun here.” Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes lit up, and she moved closer to Shen Zhining, “When we have time, shall we go parachuting?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pinched her cheeks, “You like extreme sports so much?”</p> 
 <p>“You know, everyone wants to rebel sometimes. The more you’re not supposed to do something, the more you crave it. Before, I really envied people who could do those things,” Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining thought back to the time when he had gone skiing with her. She was especially happy then, and she was grinning the entire day.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say you were free next month? I’ll accompany you to wherever you want to go.”</p> 
 <p>“Really? You’re available?”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t hire so many employees just for them to freeload.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled, “That’s good. Let’s go when I’m done with the movie premiere.”</p> 
 <p>Tomorrow, she would return back to China. Luckily, she still had a short period where she could relax.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the crowd on the other side burst out into jeers.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked over and saw that Daisy’s face was covered with spilt wine as she stood alone, looking particularly weak and helpless. A woman holding an empty wine glass stood in front of her, and she seemed to have said something before walking away with the man beside her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned and was about to go over when she was pulled back by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p><em>He does not want her to meddle in other people’s business?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining doubtfully, but he hinted to her with his eyes.</p> 
 <p>She looked over and saw that Prince Wight was pulling Daisy away.</p> 
 <p>She couldn’t help but think of the two’s affair again. It seems Prince Wight really did have some feelings for Daisy.</p> 
 <p>“Zhining, do you think Prince Wight’s feelings are sincere?”</p> 
 <p>“Whether he’s sincere or not doesn’t have anything to do with us.”</p> 
 <p>He was right. Sheng Jiaoyang sat down again and continued to chat with Shen Zhining about where they would go next to have fun.</p> 
 <p>After a while, an attendant came and respectfully asked Shen Zhining to go to the study, saying that the Prince requested for him.</p> 
 <p>Because he only asked for Shen Zhining, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t follow along, and so she just waited for Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Soon, somebody invited her for a dance. She used her injured foot as an excuse to reject them.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang scanned the room to look for Daisy. She still couldn’t find her, but she remembered that earlier, Daisy had been drinking with somebody on the other side of the room.</p> 
 <p>“Miss, our Prince requests your presence.” It was the same attendant that had called for Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang found it strange but didn’t think much before following the attendant.</p> 
 <p>They arrived in front of a door and the attendant asked her to enter.</p> 
 <p>She had just entered when the door closed behind her. Prince Wight was sitting behind the table, but strangely, Shen Zhining was actually not present.</p> 
 <p>“What did Your Highness want me for?” Sheng Jiaoyang went right to the point.</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight picked up a remote control from his table and aimed it at the curtains behind Sheng Jiaoyang. He pressed a button and the curtains automatically opened.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to take a look, but her look soon became a stare. She hadn’t expected a glass wall behind the window curtains. Behind the wall, she saw Shen Zhining and…Daisy.</p> 
 <p>She walked to the glass wall and waved towards them, but they didn’t seem to see her.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a one-way mirror,” Prince Wight walked over.</p> 
 <p>“What is His Highness’ purpose for calling me over?” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned. <em>What’s Prince Wight trying to do?</em></p> 
 <p>Prince Wight pushed another button, and voices rang out.</p> 
 <p>“What did you want to talk to me about?” This was Daisy’s voice.</p> 
 <p>“If you come with me, I’ll settle the debt for your family.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes widened, and she didn’t dare to believe her own ears. However, it really was Shen Zhining’s voice, and it completely matched the movement of Shen Zhining’s lips on the other side of the mirror.</p> 
 <p><em>What’s happening?</em></p> 
 <p>On the other side, Daisy’s face was also shocked.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you love Xu Jiaojiao? Why are you…” Daisy hesitated.</p> 
 <p>“You only need to answer yes or no.”</p> 
 <p>Daisy’s face was still speaking hesitantly, “I already agreed to be with Wight.”</p> 
 <p>“Does he have the monetary ability to repay your debt? You think you can still be accepted by the royal family as you are now?” Shen Zhining easily brought out two counterpoints.</p> 
 <p>Daisy fell silent.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt like her heart was being squeezed by somebody, and piercing pain washed over her.</p> 
 <p>She turned to look at Prince Wight and saw that his face was also solemn. Her voice was a bit hoarse as she asked, “Are you guys playing a prank?”</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight took the remote control and turned off the sound. Then, he turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang before saying, “It’s not a prank.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t believe it.” She couldn’t believe that Shen Zhining could suddenly do this behind her back.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining. He was currently looking at Daisy with an expressionless face. It was impossible to see his true mood.</p> 
 <p>“If he supported another woman behind your back, what would you do?” Prince Wight asked.</p> 
 <p>“He wouldn’t,” Sheng Jiaoyang’s voice turned firm, “He’s not that kind of person.”</p> 
 <p>“You just saw it with your own eyes and heard it with your own ears. He wants to support Daisy.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mind was especially clear tonight. She connected the scene and Prince Wight’s intentions together and an idea formed in her head.</p> 
 <p>She took a deep breath and looked at Prince Wight, “You called him to test Daisy, right? You want to know how sincere Daisy is to you.”</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight’s eyes flashed with astonishment as he narrowed his eyes, “How certain are you?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around again to look at Shen Zhining. Then, she raised her chin and replied with a confident voice, “I’m certain. Nobody knows him better than me.”</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight was silent for a moment before he spoke with an envious voice, “Shen Zhining’s such a cold person without any appeal at all, and yet you all like him so much.”</p> 
 <p><em>Cold person? No appeal?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang raised her brow but declined to comment.</p> 
 <p>However, when she thought back to the pain she felt earlier, she was in an especially bad mood. <em>Shen Zhining and Prince Wight were both testing each other’s loved ones?</em></p> 
 <p>“Take me over there.” Sheng Jiaoyang pointed at the other side.</p> 
 <p>“What do you want to do?”</p> 
 <p>“You’ll know soon enough.” Sheng Jiaoyang replied with a cold face.</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight looked at them and saw that Shen Zhining had already stood up, so he knew that the test was already over. He picked up the remote control and pressed a key.</p> 
 <p>The whole glass wall suddenly slid open.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was startled. She didn’t expect that the whole wall could move.</p> 
 <p>The glass wall’s movement attracted the attention of the two.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s face was unsurprised, as he clearly knew about the wall already. But in the next moment, his face changed, because he saw Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Daisy’s face was filled with shock when she saw Prince Wight and Sheng Jiaoyang. She was completely dazed, and she could not respond to what was happening.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao…” Shen Zhining quickly walked over to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t come near me!” Sheng Jiaoyang backed away from him. “I don’t want to hear any explanations, I only believe what I saw and heard with my own eyes and ears.”</p> 
 <p>Her face was disappointed as she glanced at Shen Zhining, before running out the door.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining fiercely glared at Prince Wight before turning to chase after her.</p> 
 <p>“Wait a moment!” Prince Wight’s heart pounded heavily.</p> 
 <p><em>God, he never saw somebody’s mood change so quickly.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Didn’t she say she completely believed in Shen Zhining? How did she suddenly change her attitude so quickly? Shen Zhining would definitely misunderstand him.</em></p> 
 <p>Prince Wight smiled bitterly.</p> 
 <p>“So you were actually testing me?” Daisy looked at Prince Wight and asked.</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight calmed his expression down as he looked at Daisy. Then, he asked back, “Did you agree to his offer?”</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you already hear it?” Daisy turned to glance at the other room, unhappiness clearly evident on her face.</p> 
 <p>“I want to hear you say it to me.”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t! Who do you take me for? I would never go back on what I promised.”</p> 
 <p>A smile broke out on Prince Wight’s face as he stepped forward. He was just about to hug Daisy when he suddenly heard her speak.</p> 
 <p>“However, right now, I really want to reconsider the possibility of us being together. Shen Zhining’s words weren’t wrong, you can’t handle my family’s debt or marry me. So, did you really just want to play with me?”</p> 
 <p>“No, Daisy. Listen to me.” Prince Wight became anxious, “The reason why I was testing you was because I was afraid you didn’t truly want to be with me.”</p> 
 <p>“You just didn’t trust me. I think it’s better if we break up. You can find somebody you can trust and I’ll find somebody who can deal with my debt…” Daisy’s words weren’t finished when she was suddenly embraced by Prince Wight.</p> 
 <p>“Daisy, be my princess!”</p> 
 <p>Daisy remained silent for a moment before finally pushing away Prince Wight. She asked cautiously, “Do you really want to marry me and bring my family’s debt onto your shoulders? The royal family won’t agree with your decision.”</p> 
 <p>“My marriage is my own business, I don’t need their agreement.”</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight gripped Daisy’s hand tightly, “Daisy, I love you. I fell in love with you three years ago. Give me a chance to care for you, I’ll definitely help you clear your family’s debt.”</p> 
 <p>It was a lie if Daisy said she wasn’t moved. Prince Wight’s love for her remained strong despite her family’s situation. After experiencing so many things, Daisy felt that this kind of love was too precious.</p> 
 <p>She saw the sincere expression on Prince Wight’s face and took the initiative to kiss him.</p> 
 <p>Prince Wight was startled for a moment before fiercely responding to Daisy’s kiss.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Shen Zhining finally caught up with Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pulled Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand and spoke anxiously, “Jiaojiao, everything you heard was fake. I was just helping Wight-”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to hear it!” Sheng Jiaoyang interrupted him.</p> 
 <p>“Let me finish.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want to hear it. I want to go home, let’s not meet again—mm!”</p> 
 <p>She hadn’t finished speaking when she was pushed against a corridor wall, her chin held by him as her lips were blocked by his.</p>
