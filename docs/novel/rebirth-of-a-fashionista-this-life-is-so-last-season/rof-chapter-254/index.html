 <p><em>Zhining, I’m downstairs at your company.</em> Shen Zhining was in a meeting when he received this message.</p> 
 <p>Everyone in the meeting was stunned to see Shen Zhining’s furrowed eyebrows smoothened out. Just moments ago, the latter still had on a heavy expression after the project issues were addressed. However, now a smile was tugged at the corners of his mouth and his aura had changed completely.</p> 
 <p>"Weinan, go downstairs to pick up someone," Shen Zhining said without looking up.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan was accustomed to carrying out his orders, so he immediately stood up. He was about to leave the meeting room when he was stopped by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>"Wait, you stay here. I'll go." Shen Zhining then asked the others to continue with the discussion and strode out of the meeting room.</p> 
 <p>"Assistant Jing, who’s downstairs? President Shen actually went down in person!" the person sitting closest to Jing Weinan curiously inquired.</p> 
 <p>"I don't know," Jing Weinan replied expressionlessly. Actually, he already knew the answer in his heart.</p> 
 <p>One by one, the rest stopped discussing the project and started guessing the identity of the person downstairs.</p> 
 <p>"Based on President Shen's expression, I bet that it must be the future lady boss."</p> 
 <p>"But what if you’re wrong?"</p> 
 <p>"I can’t be wrong. That smile on President Shen's face…ahem, it’s obviously an expression of someone in love."</p> 
 <p>"What are you saying? That’s obviously a very tender and doting expression."</p> 
 <p>"Is President Shen really dating Xu Jiaojiao?"</p> 
 <p>"They must be dating! Recently, they were spotted together and the paparazzi have photographed them together many times."</p> 
 <p>"If things continue on like this, Xu Jiaojiao might really end up as our future lady boss!"</p> 
 <p>"Ahem!" Jing Weinan reminded his colleagues who were in the midst of fervent gossiping, "The boss asked you all to discuss the project, not to gossip about him."</p> 
 <p>Everyone sat down and began to discuss the project’s issues in an earnest manner.</p> 
 <p>The two receptionists were talking about what to eat after work when someone walked into the lobby. They immediately stopped their chit-chat.</p> 
 <p>"Hello, what can I do for you… OMG, aren’t you Xu Jiaojiao?"</p> 
 <p>Her fellow colleague’s eyes also widened in shock as she fixed her gaze at the approaching Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang donned a simple black singlet and a pair of jeans. There was also a cartoon patterned scarf wrapped around her elbow and a cell phone in her hand. Wearing a low-key cap and black-rimmed glasses, there were no traces of makeup on her face. She was young, so her skin was fair and shiny, making her appear exceptionally bright and fresh.</p> 
 <p><em>As expected, it's Xu Jiaojiao.</em></p> 
 <p>Hearing the inquiry from the girls at the front desk, Sheng Jiaoyang just smiled at them.</p> 
 <p>"Ah?! It really is her! May I have your autograph please?" One of the girls quick-wittedly took out a pen and paper.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was now accustomed to this, so she walked over and signed on the paper.</p> 
 <p>"You're here to see President Shen, right?" the quick-witted receptionist asked in an affirmative tone.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed the pen and signed paper back to the receptionist and was about to answer when a ‘ding’ sound came from the elevator area. When she looked over, she saw Shen Zhining coming out of the elevator and walking towards her.</p> 
 <p>"President Shen." The two receptionists hastily greeted.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded slightly in response, but his gaze was fixated on Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"Why didn’t you stay home and rest?" Shen Zhining paid close attention to her complexion and was only relieved when he saw that she looked fine.</p> 
 <p>"Someone has invited me to lunch."</p> 
 <p>He wrapped his arm around her shoulder and led her to the elevator. "My meeting isn’t over yet, so wait for me in my office."</p> 
 <p>The two receptionists watched them walk into the elevator and looked at each other.</p> 
 <p>"Our President Shen is in love. It’s the first time I’ve seen him looking at someone with such a tender and warm expression."</p> 
 <p>"Our Prince Charming now belongs to someone else."</p> 
 <p>"Initially, I thought they were only in a mutual benefit sort of relationship. But now that I have seen them together, I have to admit that our president is truly in love."</p> 
 <p>"Say, there are so many beautiful stars aside from Xu Jiaojiao, why did President Shen take a fancy to her? And, she's only eighteen! Now that I think about it, what were we doing when we were eighteen? Back then, I was attending college and worrying about failing my exams. But look at Xu Jiaojiao, she has become a famous celebrity and found herself such an outstanding boyfriend. She’s truly a big winner in life."</p> 
 <p>"Don't compare yourself with others, because when you do, it will only make you angry."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang followed Shen Zhining to the top floor and entered his office.</p> 
 <p>"You can make yourself at home here while you wait. If you want to eat or drink something, just ask Liu Qi to get them for you. The computer’s password is your birthday." </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang asked in surprise, "My birthday? Which one?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining smiled at her, "Both birthdays." Afterwards, he requested his secretary to take care of her and then went back to the meeting room.</p> 
 <p>Liu Qi looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, who was walking towards the office desk and politely asked, "Miss, what would you like to drink?" <em>Her boss actually remembers Xu Jiaojiao’s Gregorian calendar and Lunar calendar birthdays and specifically uses them as his computer’s password. Isn't this called ‘loving one with all your heart and soul’?</em></p> 
 <p><em>This means that Xu Jiaojiao will likely become the Lady Boss one day.</em> Liu Qi silently sized Sheng Jiaoyang up. <em>She’s very young and has a good temperament. It’s her first time in the boss’ office, yet she didn’t curiously look around here and there.</em></p> 
 <p>"Water is fine, thank you!"</p> 
 <p>After responding, Sheng Jiaoyang pulled out the chair and sat down behind the desk. She naturally knew that Shen Zhining wasn’t referring to the Lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar birthdays. She first entered Jiaoyang's actual birthday, and then entered the birthday of her current identity.</p> 
 <p>The computer was successfully unlocked and what came into sight was the screen’s background image.</p> 
 <p>The desktop background image was actually a picture of her smiling at the camera.</p> 
 <p><em>This is really…</em></p> 
 <p>A smile blossomed on Sheng Jiaoyang's face. If it wasn’t for the glasses she was wearing right now, her smiling expression would look exactly the same as the one on the background image.</p> 
 <p>"Here’s your water." Liu Qi walked to the lateral side of the office desk and gently placed the glass of water in the upper left corner. She was supposed to be standing in front of the desk to hand over the glass of water, but she was slightly curious to see what her boss' celebrity girlfriend would do on his computer, so she moved to the side. She pretended to look up inadvertently and caught a glimpse of the desktop background.</p> 
 <p><em>Who would have thought…</em></p> 
 <p>Liu Qi felt as if her big boss had struck her with ten thousand arrows.</p> 
 <p>"Thank you." Sheng Jiaoyang picked up the glass of water and took a sip.</p> 
 <p>"You're most welcome!" Liu Qi answered.</p> 
 <p>Out of nowhere, a notebook and a gel ink pen appeared in Liu Qi’s hands and she slightly bowed towards Sheng Jiaoyang. "I'm a big fan of yours. Can I have your autograph, please?"</p> 
 <p><em>Even though she wasn't a Jiao fan previously, she was one from now on.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Xu Jiaojiao is truly amazing! She actually managed to subdue her cold and aloof big boss.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang accepted the notebook and pen and swept a glance at Liu Qi before signing and asking, "How long have you been working here?"</p> 
 <p>"I started working here when the company was founded." Liu Qi was a little nervous. <em>Why did Xu Jiaojiao suddenly ask this question? Was she probing to check whether I’m harboring any feelings towards Boss?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang handed the notebook and pen back to Liu Qi and added, "Then, you must be very familiar with the restaurants around here, right?" </p> 
 <p>Liu Qi blankly stared at her for a moment before rapidly responding, "I can’t say that I know all of them, but I’m familiar with the majority."</p> 
 <p>"Alright, don't worry about me. Go ahead and continue with your own work." Sheng Jiaoyang then shifted her gaze back to the computer screen.</p> 
 <p>"In that case, let me know if you need anything." Liu Qi retreated with a look of understanding.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang browsed the Internet for a while but soon got bored. Coupled with the fact that she didn't take a nap today, she started to feel drowsy and fell asleep on the desk. She only woke up when she felt someone’s warm touch on her skin. She looked up and took off her glasses. Her vision blurred, but she could still clearly see Shen Zhining standing next to her.</p> 
 <p>"The meeting is over?" She rubbed her eyes with one hand and held onto her glasses with the other.</p> 
 <p>Looking at her dazed appearance, Shen Zhining chuckled. He picked up her glasses and put them on for her. At the same time, he held her cheek in one hand and gently stroked her reddened forehead with the other. "There’s a bed in the lounge area. Why didn’t you go over there to have a rest?"</p> 
 <p>"I just wanted to get some sleep."</p> 
 <p>"Where do you want to go now? Home?" Shen Zhining held her hand and led her outside.</p> 
 <p>"It's still early. Zhining, let’s go and grab something to eat. I haven’t had lunch yet."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining paused and looked at her with a frown. "Didn't you say that someone has invited you to lunch?"</p> 
 <p>"Yes, but he had other things in mind. I didn't feel like talking to him, so I left."</p> 
 <p>A cold glint flashed across Shen Zhining's pupils as he narrowed his eyes. "Who did you meet?" </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn't even hesitate and directly responded, "It’s Li Yu. Now I understand how Entertainment International has managed to rise to the top in just a few short years. Li Yu is really something. If I were the original Xu Jiaojiao, I would have been tricked to do his biddings a long time ago."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining frowned.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him and asked, "Zhining, I want to open my own studio. You won’t mind, right?" </p> 
 <p>"Don't bother. I'll transfer all my shares to you." Shen Zhining nonchalantly answered.</p> 
 <p>He was a major shareholder, he was in control of at least 50% of the shares in Entertainment International. <em>He said that he’d transfer all his shares to her. It was such a large sum of money, yet he made it sound so insignificant.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang coughed. Although they were very close, they hadn’t reached the stage where ‘what’s yours is mine’. She hurriedly declined, "Please don't, I like it better when I start something from scratch."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining merely stared at her and stated, "It's all yours, sooner or later."</p> 
 <p><em>His words are…very pleasing to the ear, exceptionally sweet.</em></p> 
 <p>"We'll talk about it when the time comes. Let's go and grab some food." Sheng Jiaoyang retracted her hand and hooked it around his arm instead.</p> 
 <p>Liu Qi stood at the door, so she opened the door for them and silently watched them leave.</p> 
 <p>"President Shen." </p> 
 <p>"President Shen." </p> 
 <p>Several employees standing in front of the elevator hurriedly greeted Shen Zhining, but their gazes uncontrollably shifted to Sheng Jiaoyang instead. They didn't go down with the others earlier just so they could catch a glimpse of their future lady boss.</p> 
 <p><em>She didn’t look as radiant as she did on TV, but she appears much more friendly in person.</em></p> 
 <p><em>She has a good temperament and could be described as a sophisticated beauty. She looks gorgeous even without makeup.</em></p> 
 <p><em>She’s so tall.</em></p> 
 <p>Several of them thought to themselves.</p>
