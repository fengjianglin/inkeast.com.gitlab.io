 <p>“Darling, are you awake? What do you want for breakfast?”</p> 
 <p>Lina had just opened her eyes when she heard a man’s gentle voice by her ear. She looked at him expressionlessly, “I want dumplings.”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell somebody to buy it.” </p> 
 <p>“I want you to personally buy them.” </p> 
 <p>The man was momentarily startled before he looked deeply into her eyes. “Alright, anything for you,” he said, fully intent on spoiling her. </p> 
 <p>“Darling, just stay here and wait for me.” He planted a kiss on her face. </p> 
 <p>Lina responded by clamping her eyes shut. </p> 
 <p>When she heard the man leave, she suddenly opened her eyes and took the contract out from underneath the pillow. Then, she clenched her teeth as she got up. Trembling, she slowly got dressed, and finally wobbled out of the room.</p> 
 <p>Once she pushed the door open, she was blocked by the bodyguards at the door.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Lina, Boss told us you must stay in the room and wait for his return.”</p> 
 <p>Lina’s coldly barked out, “Move!”</p> 
 <p>“Without Boss’ order, we can’t let you go.” The bodyguards were very obstinate. </p> 
 <p>Just as Lina was about to try and force her way out, a bunch of footsteps rang out in the corridor. </p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu.” Sheng Jiaoyang walked over. </p> 
 <p>Lina suddenly felt her nose turn sour.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s bodyguards restrained the two bodyguards at the door as she hastily supported Lina. </p> 
 <p>“Are you alright?”</p> 
 <p>Lina shook her head but remained silent.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s leave first.” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the two bodyguards. “You guys don’t have to struggle. When your boss comes back, just tell him that she was taken by me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang supported Lina to the elevator, before taking her home. Lina remained silent the entire journey. When they arrived at Lina’s residence, she suddenly hugged Sheng Jiaoyang tightly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hugged Lina back in return and gently patted Lina’s back to comfort her. Soon, she felt her shoulder become damp. “If you want to cry, just cry. I’ll stay by your side, no matter what.” </p> 
 <p>After a while, Lina stepped away from the embrace. Although tears were still in her eyes, she smiled and took out a contract from her bosom. “I got this back.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised a brow as she took the contract and looked it over. Soon, she realised that it was the purchasing order contract that George had spoken of. </p> 
 <p>“So it was actually all Sven’s fault!” Sheng Jiaoyang instantly understood the entire situation. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mood was very complicated, and she looked at Lina with a conflicted gaze before releasing a sigh, “Why did you… isn’t the problem solved simply by paying the compensation fee? I would’ve helped you!” </p> 
 <p>Lina shook her head, “I know you would’ve helped me, but this isn’t just a small matter of one or two million dollars. Since this issue started because of me, I should settle it by myself.” </p> 
 <p>“But you also shouldn’t have…” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the traces left on Lina’s lips and neck, and she couldn’t bring herself to say any harsh words. </p> 
 <p>By choosing to resolve the issue in this way, the saddest person would certainly be Lina herself. Right now, as her good sister, she absolutely cannot make her feel even worse. She had to unconditionally support her. </p> 
 <p>“Forget it, it already happened. Just take it that you played with a decent looking boy toy. Nobody else but you and I will know about this. Only you and I know about this. As for George… it’s better not to tell him.” Sheng Jiaoyang gripped Lina’s hand. </p> 
 <p>Lina was silent for a moment, “I’m afraid Sven will bring it up with him.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned as she thought back to the night of the bachelorette party she attended with Lina. She could still recall how nervous she felt when the man called Sven gave Lina a meaningful gaze before he left. </p> 
 <p>“He only planned this because he didn’t get to sleep with you before. Now that he has achieved his goal, he might leave you alone.” Sheng Jiaoyang still decided to try and soothe and reassure her. </p> 
 <p>“Yeah.” Lina agreed verbally, but the worry on her face showed that she thought otherwise.</p> 
 <p>“You… do you want to take a bath?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked hesitantly.</p> 
 <p>Lina instantly understood what she meant and a trace of awkwardness flashed by her face. In a voice that was as soft as a mouse’s squeak, she whispered, “He helped me wash up last night.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was a bit astonished. It seems this Sven could be a little considerate.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I want to get a little more sleep. Can you go help me… buy some medicine?”</p> 
 <p>“Alright. Go take a nap.”</p> 
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang left, Lina went to the bathroom and took off her clothes. She stood in front of the full-length mirror and looked at the marks left on her body. Then, she closed her eyes and turned on the nozzle, and let the ice-cold water pour down on her body. She trembled, but her heart actually felt a bit better.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t want to show her true feelings in front of Sheng Jiaoyang and cause her to worry. </p> 
 <p><em>No matter what her intentions were, she had still betrayed George…</em></p> 
 <p>Back at the hotel, Sven had just returned to the room with breakfast. When he saw the expressions of the two bodyguards, he knew that something had happened. He lifted his hand to indicate that they didn’t need to explain what happened, and entered the room himself. </p> 
 <p>As expected, the room was completely empty. Yet, Sven actually burst out laughing. </p> 
 <p>He looked at the messy quilt and his lips curled into a smile. A stubborn and hungry light shone in his eyes as he whispered to himself, “Darling, the game’s just begun!”</p> 
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang returned with food and medicine, she saw that Lina had fallen asleep, so she quietly left the room. </p> 
 <p>She sat on the sofa in the living room and looked through the contract with a complex feeling. She glanced a few times at Lina’s room before finally deciding to use her phone to call George. </p> 
 <p>She spoke immediately, “I have your partner’s contract.” </p> 
 <p>George was startled, “How did you do it?” He seemed to find the news hard to believe. </p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to care about how I did it. Just know that the whole thing is over. Lina said she’ll join me in China for a few days. You don’t have to come.” Sheng Jiaoyang thought of the marks on Lina’s body. She would definitely have to hide for a few days.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you,” George said sincerely. </p> 
 <p>A strange expression appeared on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face. Then she added, “We met one of Lina’s rivals here, and they wanted to cause trouble for us. If you ever hear anything unpleasant, it must have been something that the rival came up with to sow discord.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright,” George replied.</p> 
 <p>After settling Lina’s worries, Sheng Jiaoyang leaned on the sofa and let out a sigh. </p> 
 <p>If something like this happened to her, what would she do? Would she sleep with somebody once, so as to help her beloved get through an enormous debt crisis?</p> 
 <p>Her head hurt after thinking about this topic. This made her all the more worried for Mei Niu. </p> 
 <p>She didn’t have to worry about this sort of thing happening to her, because with Shen Zhining’s ability, he would always be the one trapping others, and not the other way around. </p> 
 <p>Just as she was letting her imagination run wild, the phone rang. It was Shen Zhining calling. </p> 
 <p>“You wanted me to find the family behind the company…”</p> 
 <p>“Zhining, I already know who’s behind it,” Sheng Jiaoyang interrupted him.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining paused before asking, “What happened?”</p> 
 <p>“I already got the contract, so you don’t have to look into it anymore.”</p> 
 <p>“Do you have to treat me like an outsider?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sighed, “Zhining, Mei Niu, she…forget it, it’s already over. I won’t bring it up.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining didn’t ask her what happened. He just wanted to make sure Sheng Jiaoyang was alright. “I’m busy today, so I’ll drop by tomorrow.” </p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to, I want to bring Mei Niu back to China to relax for a few days. You can focus on work, don’t mind me.”</p> 
 <p>After chatting for a while, Sheng Jiaoyang hung up. </p> 
 <p>She originally wanted to wait for Lina to wake up before giving her the medicine, but she still hadn’t come out after a long time, so Sheng Jiaoyang felt that something wasn’t right, and she went into her room to check on her. When she saw that Lina’s face was deathly pale, she immediately panicked and used her hand to feel her forehead. Sure enough, she had a fever. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hastily sent Lina to the hospital. </p> 
 <p>After the doctors gave her an IV drip, colour gradually returned to Lina’s face. </p> 
 <p>Lost in thought, Sheng Jiaoyang sat beside the bed and looked at Lina. </p> 
 <p>Mei Niu’s happy life had just begun, so why did such a thing have to happen to her…</p> 
 <p>“…You can’t come in here…” She could faintly hear the bodyguard’s voice from outside the ward. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned her head and saw a man walking in.</p> 
 <p><em>Sven!!</em></p> 
 <p>“What’d you come here for?” Sheng Jiaoyang spat coldly at him. <em>This was all because of Sven. Without him, Mei Niu would have been able to live a happy and worry-free life.</em> </p> 
 <p>Sven didn’t reply. Instead, he simply walked up to her bed and reached out to touch Lina’s face. </p> 
 <p>“Stop! Don’t touch her!” Sheng Jiaoyang glared at him fiercely, like a mother hen trying to guard her little chick. </p> 
 <p>Sven really did stop. He turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang and sized her up before remarking, “Don’t meddle so much. You should take care of yourself first. After all, there’s somebody that is always thinking about you.”</p> 
 <p>“Why did you have to get involved with Lina?” Sheng Jiaoyang ignored Sven’s words and asked him a question instead. </p> 
 <p>Sven raised a brow, “Because I want to.”</p> 
 <p>“If you really like Lina, then you shouldn’t have done something like that. It would only bring her even more pain. Since you like Lina, you should be wishing for her happiness and not making her live under your shadow!” </p> 
 <p>Sven sneered, “I’m not as tolerant as Lin Yan. I will get the person I like, no matter what.” </p> 
 <p>“You already succeeded, so you can stop now!” </p> 
 <p>“No,” Sven waggled his finger, his gaze burning as he stared at Lina, “What I want is far from this. I want all of her!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned, and she spoke with a grave expression, “Lina is already sick because of you. Don’t tell me you want to hound her to death?”</p> 
 <p>Sven laughed as he leaned over and gently touched Lina’s cheeks, before murmuring, “How could I bear to do that? Don’t worry, I’ll take it step by step.”</p> 
 <p>“You’re crazy!” Sheng Jiaoyang cursed.</p> 
 <p>“No wonder you and Lina are best friends. Even your ways of cursing people are the same.” Sven sat on the side of the hospital bed, and he looked as if he was preparing to stay. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to blow her top. She wanted to call her bodyguards to bring him out but her bodyguards were clearly subdued. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have let him enter. </p> 
 <p>“Why don’t you give up? It’s impossible for Lina to love you. Doing this would only bring her more pain.” She forced down her anger and tried to persuade him.</p> 
 <p>“Impossible? Is anything in this world truly impossible? No.” Sven refuted.</p>
