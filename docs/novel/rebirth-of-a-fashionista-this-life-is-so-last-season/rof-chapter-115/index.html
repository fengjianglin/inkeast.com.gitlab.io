<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's mood was very good. Zeng Huan, who’d come to drop her off at school, couldn’t stop herself from speaking after seeing her that way. </p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, you look really happy today. Did something good happen?” Zeng Huan tentatively asked. </p> 
 <p>"Really? Nothing happened!" </p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan didn't know how to follow that. </p> 
 <p>When they were parking the car downstairs in the dormitory, a crowd suddenly came to the front of the car, surrounding them. Looking at the way they held cameras and pointed microphones, they appeared to be entertainment journalists. </p> 
 <p>"What happened?" Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the horde of noisy people.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, there are some very nasty comments about you online. The Public Relations Department of the company is already in the process of dealing with it. You don’t need to pay attention to them,” Zeng Huan explained.</p> 
 <p>Looking at the people outside knocking on the window, Sheng Jiaoyang frowned. It was nothing to be surrounded like this. She immediately pushed open the door and got out of the car. </p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao!" Zeng Huan panicked.</p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao, what do you think about the allegations online?" </p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao, is your backer really the boss of Entertainment International? It’s said that he’s married. Are you involved in any unwritten rules<span id="footnote-ref-ebef"><a href="#footnote-ebef">[1]</a></span> with him?” </p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao…" </p> 
 <p>Everyone was talking at once. Numerous microphones were being pushed forward as if they wanted to enter Sheng Jiaoyang’s nostrils. </p> 
 <p>"No need to be so impatient, everyone can ask one question. We’re all civilised people. We should be speaking in turns.” Sheng Jiaoyang had a friendly attitude. She had lots of experience in dealing with people, so she didn’t panic while facing such a chaotic scene. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pointed to the person on the far left. “Let’s begin with you.” She quickly took control of the situation with her calm disposition. </p> 
 <p>"It’s said online that at the beginning of your career, you were strongly supported by Entertainment International because you and President Li of Entertainment International had some secret relationship. What’s your view on this revelation?” the first person quickly asked.</p> 
 <p>"Wait, let me calculate." Sheng Jiaoyang stretched out her hand and began to count seriously. "Altogether, I’ve only met him four times.” </p> 
 <p>"Next, your turn." Sheng Jiaoyang immediately turned her eyes to look at the second person, leaving no opportunities for the first person to ask further. </p> 
 <p>“Recently, a video of you verbally attacking a class teacher has been forwarded many times. Even Han Yaying has forwarded the video, urging you to pursue studies open-mindedly and warning you that reputation should never be capitalised on pride. Regardless of profession and status, teachers should be treated with respect. What do you have to say about this?” </p> 
 <p>"Senior, despite your busy schedule, you still pay close attention to my affairs. I’m extremely flattered,” Sheng Jiaoyang said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Did you break up with Gu Zhou? Why isn’t he coming out to help you?" the third person asked.</p> 
 <p>"Only one question is allowed, so I’ll reply to your first question. Senior Gu and I are only friends.” </p> 
 <p>Seeing her answering in such a watertight manner, a young girl wearing round glasses, who stood on the far right, couldn’t bear it anymore. Due to this, she ended up asking, “Are you really seventeen?” </p> 
 <p>"Of course. Okay, the last question has been asked.” </p> 
 <p>“…” The girl in glasses was dumbfounded. She didn't want to ask that question! </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed and gave a playful wink to the smart-looking girl with glasses. “Since you’re so lovely, I’ll give you another chance to ask a question.” </p> 
 <p>The girl with round glasses blushed a little. She raised her microphone to ask, “Jiaojiao, do you currently have a boyfriend?” </p> 
 <p>"Yes,” Sheng Jiaoyang confirmed.</p> 
 <p>"Is it Gu Zhou?" </p> 
 <p>"Is it Ye Fan?" </p> 
 <p>“Is it Zhang Yue?"</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>The group of journalists once more exploded in an uproar. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang kept smiling and said, “If you have any further questions, you can ask my assistant. She can arrange a venue for you to ask so you don’t have to wait for me outside in this blazing sun. Everyone, I’m going to study hard and keep improving. Goodbye!”</p> 
 <p>"If anyone has anything more you want to know, you may ask me. Jiaojiao is going to be late. Let her go to class first!” Zeng Huan hurriedly warded off the journalists. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang waved to everyone before entering the dormitory to grab her books.</p> 
 <p>On the way to the classroom, she noticed people pointing at her and talking behind her back. However, it had no effect on her mood. When she finally reached the classroom, the noisy classroom instantly quietened down. </p> 
 <p>“What happened?” Previously, when they were in classes together, everyone would come and say hello to her.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao.” A female student stood up with a remorseful look on her face. “I’m sorry. I released that video before because I wanted to let everyone know how Teacher Zhu was making things difficult for you. I didn’t expect crazy people to forward the video after editing it.” </p> 
 <p>“So, what happened in the end?” Sheng Jiaoyang sat down on her seat.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t know?” Everyone was shocked. </p> 
 <p>Since she was constantly researching on how to brush up Boss Shen’s good opinion of her, when would Sheng Jiaoyang have the time to look at the news about her. She shook her head and said, “I was blocked downstairs when I went to the dormitory to get my books. A group of people surrounded me, asking me things from one topic to another. At that time, I was puzzled.” </p> 
 <p>“Look up on Weibo yourself. In the hot search list your name appears in the third position.”</p> 
 <p>The next moment the bell rang for class to start.</p> 
 <p>“This class is Basic English, so won’t it still be Old Zhu?” </p> 
 <p>“He even said on Weibo that Jiaojiao asked her backer to exert pressure on the school to dismiss him…” </p> 
 <p>“Stop speaking. He’s coming!”</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, striding towards the classroom was Zhu Yongzhi. He held his head high like a strong warrior, his eyes complacent. Currently, a lot of people on the internet were standing up for him. In the heart of the storm, the school didn’t dare to do anything to him. If he’d gone with his Brother-in-law’s method, humbly asking for forgiveness, it would’ve been useless. Instead, Professor Tan’s method had immediately produced the desired result. </p> 
 <p>He scornfully looked at the girl with the bob cut. <em>What can a celebrity do?</em></p> 
 <p>The students in the class were very quiet. Zhu Yongzhi still bore a grudge against the students for complaining about his work to his brother-in-law. Therefore, he conducted the class in an even more perfunctory manner, not caring whether or not the students were listening or even understanding. </p> 
 <p>At the end of the class, Zhu Yongzhi raised his head and said smugly, “Student Xu Jiaojiao, you can still apologise to me. Everyone will take your young age into consideration and not fuss too much.” </p> 
 <p>The students were in an uproar, outrage evident on their faces.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was in a good mood today. She didn’t want to stoop to the level of these types of people, but she also wouldn’t let them walk all over her. She sneered and said loudly, “Teacher Zhu, yesterday you blocked my way to apologise to me, saying that making things difficult for me wasn’t your original intention and that you were instigated by someone else. With how quickly you misrepresent the facts, it’s really a wonder how you became a lecturer at our school with your level.”</p> 
 <p>Zhu Yongzhi panicked upon hearing the words ‘instigated by someone else’. He clearly remembered that he didn’t say those words. <em>Did she know of the deal between him and Professor Tan?</em></p> 
 <p>“Wow, it was actually instigated by someone else. Such a sinister person!” </p> 
 <p>“Someone must’ve seen Jiaojiao becoming famous, and feeling jealous, they wanted to suppress her.” </p> 
 <p>“There’s too many crooked people in the world!”</p> 
 <p>The girls began to discuss amongst themselves.</p> 
 <p>“Class Finished!” Zhu Yongzhi angrily shouted before rushing out of the classroom. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, was Old Zhu truly following someone’s orders?” a girl asked.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled. “I bluffed. Looking at his guilt-ridden expression, it must be true.” </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I took a video of this class too. I’ll upload it in a moment and let others see how bad Old Zhu’s lectures are.” A girl sitting by the window lifted her mobile and waved to Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>“I did too!” several girls said, one after the other. </p> 
 <p>“I’ll be troubling my dear classmates to send me both videos; the ones you filmed today, and the videos you took last time. I’ll hand it over to the people at the Public Relations Department and let them handle it. After this matter’s settled, I’ll treat you all to a meal,” Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>“We’ll share the videos in our class groups, letting everyone see and forward them. It’ll also let other people know the truth about the matter,” the study monitor said, immediately mobilising all the students in the class. </p>
