 <p>Lina sent Sheng Jiaoyang some pictures of formal wear and asked her to choose a dress. </p> 
 <p>Among the beautiful dresses was a white dress with a tulle skirt that seemed fit for a wedding. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, let’s wear the same color. This white dress is very eye catching, it’d definitely be beautiful on you.” Lina was on a video call with Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>“You’re not supposed to wear the same color as the bride to prevent a fight for the limelight.” </p> 
 <p>“But you aren’t some random person, you’re my Little Sun!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed, “Alright, then I’ll wear that one because I believe you’ll absolutely be the most beautiful bride; nobody can steal your limelight.” </p> 
 <p>Separated by a screen, the two inseparable sisters suddenly had no words. </p> 
 <p>Lina shook her head and rubbed her eyes before turning to smile at the camera. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I’m getting married.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang released a long sigh, “My princess is finally going to become George’s queen. I don’t know if I should be sighing in relief or lighting a candle for George.” </p> 
 <p>Lina laughed, “Why would I be a queen instead of a princess?” </p> 
 <p>“Only if you want to be a generation younger than George.” </p> 
 <p>“…Fine.” </p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu,” Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly called. </p> 
 <p>“Hm? What’s up?” Lina looked at her. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but suddenly didn’t know what to say.</p> 
 <p>“What? Now you have nothing to say to me? Then after I get married, doesn’t that mean you wouldn’t speak to me at all?” Lina could relate to Sheng Jiaoyang’s hesitation but didn’t want the atmosphere to turn awkward so she started to joke. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly awoke from her daze as she laughed and teased in response. “I’m just worried after you marry and have a little baby, I won’t be your Little Sun anymore.” </p> 
 <p>“What are you saying, you’ll forever be my Little Sun! Besides, George and I aren’t planning to have a child.”</p> 
 <p>“Why?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked, startled. </p> 
 <p>A happy smile appeared on Lina’s face. “Because George thinks it’s best for us to grow old together; anyone else will always be the other party.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shivered. <em>Tsk, tsk, that’s…so corny!</em></p> 
 <p>“I almost forgot how jealous your George could be. Gosh, being jealous of his own child, how hopeless.” Sheng Jiaoyang rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Lina laughed on the screen. </p> 
 <p>“From now on, we should meet less often or your man will want me to vanish from the face of the earth!” Sheng Jiaoyang teased.</p> 
 <p>“He wouldn’t dare!” Lina immediately blurted, “I don’t need a child but I absolutely need you.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang grinned, tears forming in her eyes. She blinked them away before speaking to conceal her emotions. “I am really curious now, if George and I were both drowning, who would you save? Oh, but don’t reply, I know that you love me, but I’m afraid your reply would make a certain somebody go mad with jealousy.”</p> 
 <p>“Haha, getting a bit jealous keeps you healthy.” Lina also joined in on the teasing. </p> 
 <p>The two chatted for a long time. They only stopped when their phones started to overheat and it was time to eat. </p> 
 <p>After hanging up, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly felt a bit empty. </p> 
 <p>Although she had known about Lina’s upcoming marriage for a while, she still felt like she had lost something precious even though she knew she should be excited. </p> 
 <p>During the meal, Grandfather Yang noticed her mood and asked her what happened. </p> 
 <p>“Lina’s getting married and the date has already been decided to be next month, on the twentieth,” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled.</p> 
 <p>“May 20th? Mhmm, that’s a good day. Isn’t this a good thing? You should be excited.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not that I’m not excited, just… sigh, never mind, I am happy.”</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang glanced at her before changing the topic. “Why didn’t Zhining come back today?”</p> 
 <p>“He said he has to attend a remote meeting today, so he’d be back late.”</p> 
 <p>Yesterday, Shen Zhining had mentioned that he had shifted his work earlier, so he should be back today after he was done.</p> 
 <p>After dinner, Sheng Jiaoyang went to the studio to paint something for Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang followed behind her.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao.” Grandfather Yang called. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang squatted in front of him just like when she was small, leaning against his knees. </p> 
 <p>She knew that her grandfather came to comfort her because he noticed her bad mood during dinner. </p> 
 <p>“Grandfather, what present do you think I should give to Mei Niu?” Her voice sounded a bit muffled. </p> 
 <p>“I think, to her, your attendance is the best gift. When it’s time for you to get married, you would definitely say the same.” Grandfather Yang patted her comfortingly. </p> 
 <p>“True, but I want to give her a nice surprise too.”</p> 
 <p>“If you want a surprise, you’ll have to think of one yourself. After all, you’re the one that understands her best.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang fell silent. She was touched by his last sentence.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang shook his head with a smile, and gently murmured, “Silly child.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not like you two will be separated forever, and she’s marrying the one she loves. You should be happy for her.” </p> 
 <p>“Grandfather, I’ve known Lina since I was ten. When I transferred schools, I lived with her and ate with her. She taught me Italian, I taught her Mandarin. Together, we dealt with scoundrels that took us for pushovers. We shopped together, did our makeup together, travelled together, and went to university together…” </p> 
 <p>Her voice was a bit emotional as she continued, “I could share all my secrets with her. Apart from you, she’s the person I love most in the world. ”</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang didn’t speak and continued to stroke her head, wordlessly comforting her. </p> 
 <p>“I'm actually very excited to hear that she’s about to get married, but I can’t help feeling like I have lost a precious treasure after guarding it for a long time.” Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly felt a smile arise through the tears. “If Geroge heard me, he’d definitely be speechless. He has always treated me like a thief, afraid I’d steal Mei Niu away from him. He probably never thought that I see him the same way.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, alright, you can get Lina a condo nearby so she can stay there when she’s free. Then you two can live together just like the old days.” Grandfather Yang sighed in relief when he saw her smile again. </p> 
 <p>“Why would I have to go as far as buying a condo? If I miss her, I can go directly to her house! If George really dares to stop us, I’ll kidnap Mei Niu!” Sheng Jiaoyang said in a huff. </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang smiled. </p> 
 <p>He turned and looked at the studio. “I always see you in the studio, were you planning to paint something for Zhining’s birthday?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, after a lot of pondering, I think a hand-drawn painting would be the most sincere.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you done drawing? Let me see.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang got up and pushed Grandfather Yang’s wheelchair inside and brought him in front of the easel. </p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang put on his glasses. When he clearly saw the painting, he was stunned. </p> 
 <p>“Is this Zhining?”</p> 
 <p>“Yep.”</p> 
 <p>The reason why Grandfather Yang’s tone sounded a little uncertain was because the portrait was different from the usual. The man in the portrait was drawn rather vaguely, even his figure was indistinct. The background setting seemed to be between night and day, as if the darkness was about to pass and be overtaken by light. The figure in the painting appeared to be stepping out of the darkness, just like a great demon king. At the same time, it was similar to an angel bringing in light. </p> 
 <p>The entire portrait seemed to be filled with tension between the two forces, causing others to not help but want to look deeper. </p> 
 <p>“Why would you draw something like this?” Grandfather Yang couldn’t help but ask. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the portrait, smiling slightly, “Because that’s how I see him back then.” </p> 
 <p>“I really can’t understand how you artists think.” Grandfather Yang shook his head. </p> 
 <p>“Grandfather, don’t you think my art’s improved? For this painting, I used both the western style of layering colors and infused a traditional chinese style into it.” </p> 
 <p>“I don’t understand those things but you could call your Teacher Lawrence to take a look.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shrugged, her voice helpless: “Lawrence would be terrified. As far as he knows, I’m dead.” </p> 
 <p>“Then you can be his new student,” Grandfather Yang said casually.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes lit up. “Good idea.” </p> 
 <p>“Alright, I won’t bother you any longer. Sleep early tonight.” Grandfather Yang turned his wheelchair and rolled out of the studio. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the oil painting. Her thoughts were unknown but a foxy smile appeared on her face. </p> 
 <p>The next day, Zhining wasn’t there for breakfast. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took her phone and sent a text to Shen Zhining. He quickly replied and she was startled to find out that he was still at the company. </p> 
 <p>After quickly eating breakfast, she returned to her room and gave him a call. </p> 
 <p>“Did you not come back last night or did you leave early?” </p> 
 <p>“Yeah, I spent last night at the company.” His hoarse voice sounded very sexy even through the line’s distortion. </p> 
 <p>“Why are you working so hard? Our great Boss Shen has so many businesses, it can’t be that you’re lacking money, right?” Sheng Jiaoyang teased. </p> 
 <p>“I want our future little princess to be the richest girl in the world so she can have the confidence to do anything.” </p> 
 <p>“How domineering~ what if she turns into a real little princess then?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked. </p> 
 <p>“Then just establish a kingdom for her,” the other said jokingly. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but laugh before sensing something fishy. “What future little princess, that’s so far off into the future. Besides, even if we are together and have a child, it could also be a boy. Since you want a little princess so much, then what about a little prince?”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no little prince.”</p> 
 <p>“What?” For a moment, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t understand. </p> 
 <p>“If it’s a son, I would just lend them some money to start their own business.”</p> 
 <p><em>What a big difference! He even had to say ‘lend’ instead of give.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang lit a candle for their future child. </p> 
 <p><em>Hey, wait a moment, isn’t she thinking too far ahead? She still hasn’t even gotten married yet, nevermind having a child.</em></p> 
 <p>“Actually, that’s also okay.” Sheng Jiaoyang could detect his smile on the other end.</p> 
 <p>“Huh?” His words came from nowhere, making her a little confused. </p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a boy or little princess, I’m fine with both so long as-” He dragged out the last few words, “They are our children.”</p>
