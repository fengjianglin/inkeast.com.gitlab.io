<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Make her leave, I never want to see her again!” </p> 
 <p>When she heard her grandfather’s words, Sheng Jiaoyang stood there, stunned. </p> 
 <p><em>Her grandfather suddenly no longer wants to see her again? What happened?</em></p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Fu Lailin, who was entertaining important guests nearby, apologised to them and walked over. She looked at Sheng Jiaoyang warmly. “Jiaojiao, I’m very happy you’ve awoken, but today is a special day. I can’t celebrate your waking up.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shook her head. “Grandfather…I mean, Jiaoyang’s grandfather, why do you hate me so much?”</p> 
 <p>“After you and Zhining went to see Jiaoyang the day before yesterday, Jiaoyang’s condition worsened when you got close to her. She passed away the next day. Old Yang thought it was your fault and said that. Don’t take it to heart, he just can’t think properly right now.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t know whether to cry or laugh. </p> 
 <p>“I know you’re a good child. This isn’t your fault, everything was God’s plan,” Fu Lailin reached to hug her as she consoled her. </p> 
 <p>“Grandmother Andy, thank you.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Lailin gently patted her hand. “Why don’t you go back and rest first?”</p> 
 <p>“But, I’d very much like to participate in my…my idol’s funeral.” Sheng Jiaoyang gripped Fu Lailin’s hand, her face pleading.</p> 
 <p>Fu Lailin stared at her for a bit before giving in. “Alright, come with me to change first.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked down at her clothes and realised that if she went to a funeral like this, her clothes would definitely make others feel like she didn’t respect the deceased. Even though the ‘deceased’ was her…</p> 
 <p>Fu Lailin found a black, down-filled jacket for her. “This was one of the things that Jiaoyang left here, if you don’t mind…?” </p> 
 <p>“I don’t mind.”</p> 
 <p>After changing into the black jacket, Sheng Jiaoyang followed Fu Lailin to the funeral. When they arrived, it was already time to bid farewell to the deceased. </p> 
 <p>Everybody advanced, one by one, and stood there silently, staring at the figure in the coffin, placing their hands together to pray a few sentences before retreating in silence. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun stepped forward and couldn’t help but cry as soon as he saw her. </p> 
 <p>In such a special situation, nobody thought that it was unsightly for a big man to cry like that. Rather, everyone felt pity for him. To cry with such sincerity at his daughter’s grave meant that he was definitely a passionate man.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang’s gaze relaxed a little when he saw Sheng Xun; he finally knew how to feel regret. But, then very quickly, his gaze turned angry as he moved forward and pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang. “Why is she still here?!” </p> 
 <p>Fu Lailin stepped up and tried to advise him, “Old Yang, calm down. You shouldn’t have such an attitude towards anyone who wants to sincerely say farewell to Jiaoyang.” </p> 
 <p>“My attitude towards her is already very good! Both times Jiaoyang had an accident because of her! How can Jiaoyang rest peacefully when she shows up now?” Grandfather Yang slapped his wheelchair. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to say to Jing Weinan, “Send her back to China.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright.” Jing Weinan nodded.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang became worried as she hastily rushed towards Grandfather Yang. “Grandfather, I have something I want to say to you.” </p> 
 <p>“You aren’t my Jiaoyang, so don’t call me Grandfather!” Grandfather Yang ignored her, unwilling to take another glance at the culprit of Jiaoyang’s death. “I refuse to speak with you.” </p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan walked to Sheng Jiaoyang and offered her a hand. “Please come with me, Miss Xu.” </p> 
 <p>“I know a very important secret about Jiaoyang, don’t you want to know?” Sheng Jiaoyang ignored Jing Weinan and continued to shout at her grandfather.</p> 
 <p>“Make her leave now. Don’t argue here and disturb Jiaojiao’s rest!” Grandfather Yang urged. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was pulled out by Jing Weinan as she continued to twist around and shout at her grandfather, “Don’t you want to know why something happens every time I get close to Jiaoyang?”</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang turned to look at her but didn’t speak, allowing Jing Weinan to pull her away. </p> 
 <p>Apart from those who didn’t understand, everybody else present was very curious about her last words. </p> 
 <p>However, the funeral still proceeded.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang never saw herself one last time, and was dragged out of her own funeral. She cursed Shen Zhining internally; it was all Shen Zhining’s fault. She was so close to confessing to her grandfather, but he just had to interfere and make her leave.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Xu, please return to your room and organise your luggage,” Jing Weinan reminded her. </p> 
 <p>Under Jing Weinan’s supervision, Sheng Jiaoyang slowly returned to her room. She wanted to stealthily creep out, but Jing Weinan guarded her door. Also, her room was on the second floor, so she couldn’t jump out the window. </p> 
 <p>When Jing Weinan knocked on her door again to prepare her luggage, Sheng Jiaoyang still hadn’t been able to think of a way to escape. </p> 
 <p>“Miss Xu…” </p> 
 <p>“Don’t shout, let’s go.” Sheng Jiaoyang opened the door and rolled her eyes at Jing Weinan. </p> 
 <p>Just as they were about to get in the car, they heard a shout.</p> 
 <p>“Wait a moment!”</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang saw who was walking over, she was a bit surprised. <em>It was the young man by her grandfather’s side, An Jing. Sure enough, her grandfather took the bait.</em></p> 
 <p>“What were you going to say to Grandfather earlier?” An Jing went straight to the point and asked. </p> 
 <p>“I’ll only tell him.” </p> 
 <p>An Jing narrowed his eyes and examined her. “Think it through. If you don't say it now, you’ll never have another chance again. If you want something in return, you can tell me. If it’s not too excessive, I can give you whatever you want.” </p> 
 <p>“No, I only want to tell him alone. Please go back and tell him that this secret has to do with Jiaoyang’s life and death. If he wants to know, he has to find me.” Sheng Jiaoyang gave her phone number to An Jing. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also knew clearly that if she took the initiative to say the truth, her grandfather might not believe her. If she evoked his curiosity like this, she believed that he would definitely care about this important secret ‘concerning Jiaoyang’s life and death’.</p> 
 <p>This time, she directly boarded the car and left.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan glanced at her from the rear view mirror and started the car. </p> 
 <p>An Jing stood there, watching the car leave before returning to the funeral. </p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the airport, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t let Jing Weinan escort her as she bought her own ticket and flew back to China. </p> 
 <p>Originally, Sheng Jiaoyang had thought that her grandfather would call her to find out the truth. However, even after two days had passed, she’d gotten nothing and she hadn’t seen the slightest trace of Shen Zhining either. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t stay still and wanted to find another way when her mother, who she hadn’t contacted for a long time, said she was already home. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had to set the matter aside. It really had been a long time since she’d gone home. </p> 
 <p>After she entered, the fragrance of food assaulted her nostrils.</p> 
 <p>She heard talking in the kitchen.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang walked to the kitchen and saw something she didn’t expect. Li Weiqi was the one cooking, while Xu Qing was chatting beside him.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Jiaojiao’s back!” Xu Qing saw Sheng Jiaoyang standing at the door. </p> 
 <p>People in love were different. The current Xu Qing and the previous Xu Qing were like two different people. This difference wasn’t just from different clothes or make up, but from the heart. </p> 
 <p>The current Xu Qing was pampered and brimming with happiness, seeming almost ten years younger. </p> 
 <p>“How many days are you staying?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked without thinking. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao,” Xu Qing’s tone was filled with nervousness and anticipation. “We’re planning to get married.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stunned for a moment before grinning. “I’ve been waiting forever!” </p> 
 <p>Knowing that she didn’t mind, Xu Qing released a sigh of relief. “Jiaojiao, we’ve actually already held a small wedding ceremony in Miao Village, but we really wanted the blessings from our beloved as well. Weiqi and I talked it over and decided to come back so both sides of our families can meet each other before getting married again with the blessings of our friends and family.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s wonderful, I’ll always be your first supporter!”</p> 
 <p>“Weiqi’s family are all abroad, so they’ll arrive tomorrow. This afternoon, I planned to take Weiqi to your uncle’s home. Are you free this afternoon?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course, I am.” Even if she didn’t have time, she had to make time for such a special occasion. This was Mother Xu’s marriage after all. </p> 
 <p>Li Weiqi appeared holding a dish and turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang. “Jiao, there’s a lot of smoke here, so bring your mother to the living room. Go and see some of the pictures we took.” </p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think Weiqi could cook! I definitely need to savour it later.” Sheng Jiaoyang and Xu Qing left the kitchen. </p> 
 <p>Xu Qing looked at the kitchen, a happy smile on her face. “Weiqi had actually never cooked before. When we went to the mountains, we had to cook for ourselves. He was worried that it’d be hard on me, so he began learning how to cook, and now he can make a lot of dishes.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Xu Qing, muttering in her heart: <em>I’m afraid it’s not because he’s afraid it’d be hard on you, but rather because it’d be hard on his stomach!</em> She had no words for Mother Xu’s cooking skills other than it was no wonder the former Xu Jiaojiao was so skinny.</p> 
 <p>When it was time to eat, Sheng Jiaoyang first sampled each of the dishes. For the very picky Sheng Jiaoyang, the flavour was just so-so, but it was already far better than Mother Xu’s cooking. With such a difference, she lowered her standards and praised Li Weiqi. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had actually never been to Xu Jiaojiao’s uncle’s home before. Her previous impression was an aunt that was unwilling to help when times were rough, an uncle that was too scared of his wife to help his sister, and a cousin that was easily swindled. Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t have any impression of the grandmother, but from when she was hospitalised and not a single person from the Xu Family had gone to visit her, she knew that the whole family probably regarded them as a burden. </p> 
 <p>Nobody knew what this visit would result in. </p> 
 <p>Because Weiqi was still waiting for his license, Sheng Jiaoyang called Zeng Huan to drive them to the Xu Family’s home. </p> 
 <p>The Xu Family’s home was in a newly developed area, a compound apartment on the top floor. They couldn’t be considered well off, but they also weren’t lacking. At the very least, the uncle helping his very ungreedy sister shouldn’t be a problem. Furthermore, from her cousin’s wallet, their financial situation clearly wasn’t bad. </p> 
 <p>After pressing the doorbell, somebody eventually opened the door. </p>
