 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nearly blew up from rage when she was notified that Sven had taken Lina back to his headquarters in Italy.</p> 
 <p><em>Sven is such a jerk! He doesn’t play by the rules!</em></p> 
 <p>Throughout the night, Sheng Jiaoyang kept cursing and scolding Sven through gritted teeth. The next morning, before the sun was even up, Sheng Jiaoyang took a few bodyguards with her and went to the airport to catch the earliest flight to Italy.</p> 
 <p>As soon as she touched down at Rome, she contacted Rita.</p> 
 <p>“Are you serious, Jiao?” Rita shouted into the phone, “Are you sure that the Gudilesi Family’s Young Master kidnapped Lina?”</p> 
 <p>“Where are you? Let’s talk in person.”</p> 
 <p>“I am at home right now. Come over, we’ll talk about this.”</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang entered Rita’s manor, she was greeted by the sight of Rita lounging on her sofa and leisurely enjoying a glass of wine.</p> 
 <p>“Jiao, come take a seat. Quickly fill me in on what happened,” Rita waved excitedly at Sheng Jiaoyang. Even though she knew that Lina had been kidnapped, not a trace of worry or anxiousness could be seen on her face. Rather, she looked like she was ready and eager to listen to some gossip.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took her seat and roughly explained the whole situation to Rita. Then, she requested for her help. “Please help me find out the location where Sven hid Lina at.”</p> 
 <p>However, Rita was still immersed in Sheng Jiaoyang’s story.</p> 
 <p>“Wow, Lina actually has the Young Master’s child! It’s so shocking! Sven Gudilesi had a lot of ex-girlfriends before, and many of them even wanted to tie him down by carrying his child, but none of them had succeeded. There was even a woman who tried many ways to get pregnant, but when she finally got one, she still had a miscarriage. I heard that Sven did not allow her to give birth to the child.”</p> 
 <p>Rita put her wine glass down on the table, and cupped her faces with both hands as she excitedly said, “Lina wants to have an abortion, but Sven didn’t allow her, and even took her away. Jiaojiao, what do you think he’s trying to do?”</p> 
 <p>“He’s crazy!” Sheng Jiaoyang did not have a single shred of pleasant feelings towards Sven.</p> 
 <p>Rita’s eyes lit up, and she grabbed Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand excitedly, “I dare say that Sven has fallen in love with Lina.”</p> 
 <p>“To the hell with his love! If he truly loved her, he wouldn’t prey on her, and he wouldn’t force himself on her either.”</p> 
 <p>“No no no,” Rita wagged her finger back and forth and continued, “I’m willing to bet that Sven has definitely fallen in love with Lina. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stopped her if she wanted an abortion. He even brought Lina away, so he definitely wants Lina to have that child, and tie himself to her through their child.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s all the more reason for me to stop him. Does he think he can do whatever he wants?” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned, “Rita, just tell me. Are you going to help me out or not?”</p> 
 <p>Rita was clearly conflicted, “It’s not that I don’t want to, but I don’t have the means to. If the other party was some random thug on the street, I would definitely help you, but Sven isn’t someone who I can afford to offend.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lowered her head and let out a sigh. Then, she stood up.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I won’t force you into this. I’ll find someone else to help me.”</p> 
 <p>“Who else can help you?” Rita followed behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and looked at Rita, “You don’t have to bother about this matter anymore. I don’t wish to pull you into this mess either. Don’t worry, we will still remain as good friends.”</p> 
 <p>Rita went up and gave Sheng Jiaoyang a hug, “I wish you all the best.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang left Rita’s apartment.</p> 
 <p>She looked up another number on her mobile phone and dialed it. Within moments, the other party picked up the call.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao?” A pleasant male voice could be heard from the other end. There was also a hint of surprise in his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, let’s meet.”</p> 
 <p>Right by the window of a Michelin star restaurant, sat a good looking man and woman.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, why are you here?” Lin Yan’s face was as gentle as always, but his brows were sharper now, and it gave him a slightly different look.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, do you know what happened to Mei Niu?” Sheng Jiaoyang observed Lin Yan’s face carefully, unwilling to miss out on any minute changes in his expressions.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan looked at her, “What happened?”</p> 
 <p>“She divorced George,” Sheng Jiaoyang then continued with a more serious tone, “because of Sven.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan kept silent.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang did not see any changes on Lin Yan’s face, she could only continue to test him, “Mei Niu is pregnant with Sven’s child.”</p> 
 <p>Finally, something changed on Lin Yan’s face, as a look of surprise appeared briefly. “Are you here to see me because of Nana?”</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, I remember you’ve said before that Sven is your friend. Since he’s taken Mei Niu away now, I believe that, as her brother, you should solve this issue for her.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had initially thought of looking to Lin Yan for help, but she did not look for him immediately as she did not wish to have anything to do with Lin Yan. She was afraid that doing so would cause Shen Zhining to overthink. But since Rita was not in the position to help her, she had no other choice but to seek Lin Yan for help.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I’ll look for Sven. Jiaojiao, wait for a bit.” Lin Yan agreed to help her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lightly let out a sigh of relief. Now that Lin Yan agreed to do something, Sven might give some face to Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>“Thanks for worrying about Nana. Do you have a place to stay? Do you want to stay in Nana’s room…”</p> 
 <p>“No, I have a few bodyguards with me, so it’s not very convenient. We’ll stay in a hotel.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan seemed dejected by her response. “You rejected my offer not because it was inconvenient, but because you wanted to draw a line with me, right?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked away. It was true.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I won’t force you. Eat up, I’ll go and look for Sven now.” Lin Yan stood up and made to leave.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her mouth, but did not say anything. She watched as Lin Yan left the restaurant.</p> 
 <p>Although she was now much calmer when meeting Lin Yan, her heart still felt quite apologetic. It felt as if she only looked for him whenever she needed help, and that made her feel like she was quite a jerk.</p> 
 <p>But their current relationship was fine too. In fact, without any emotional burden, Lin Yan was now able to achieve a lot more in other aspects.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan came to look for Sheng Jiaoyang in the evening.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan told her that he tried to negotiate with Sven, but Sven didn’t want others to interfere in the matters between him and Lina. Hence, Lin Yan instead asked to visit Lina, and Sven agreed to his request.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s purpose for visiting Sheng Jiaoyang was to ask her to go and visit Lina together with him.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang did not think much of it, and she immediately agreed to go with him.</p> 
 <p>The place Sven was living at was not in the city or the suburbs. Rather, he lived in a manor located near the borders.</p> 
 <p>There was heavy security everywhere, from the large towering gates of the manor, to the entrance of the villa within the manor.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang could feel how heavily secured the area was when she alighted from her car. Though the guards were not visible to the eyes, she could feel that they were under surveillance.</p> 
 <p>The villa was immensely huge, and it looked similar to a medieval castle.</p> 
 <p>A properly dressed butler was waiting for them at the entrance. When he saw the two visitors, he bowed and said, “Dear honored guests, Master is waiting to dine together with you two at the dining room.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang walked beside Lin Yan while observing her surroundings in silence. Her understanding of Sven grew deeper as she saw the intricate wall paintings and luxury decorative pieces that adorned the interior of the villa.</p> 
 <p>As expected from the heir of an old clan. His background was definitely incomparable to most. It was no wonder that Sven always acted without restraint, he was probably spoiled by everyone since he was young.</p> 
 <p>In the huge dining room, there was a long table, and Sven was seated at one end of that table.</p> 
 <p>When he saw both of them entering the dining hall, he looked up and smirked at them, “You guys sure came quickly. Take a seat.”</p> 
 <p>“Where’s Lina?” Instead of sitting down, Sheng Jiaoyang asked him about Lina’s whereabouts first.</p> 
 <p>Sven raised his brows, and he spoke in an uncaring tone, “She’s currently on a hunger strike.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned. This was such a serious matter, and yet he did not seem to care about it at all. Sven obviously did not love Lina. Rather, his actions were that of a spoiled brat who just wanted to own the toy that caught his fancy. He did not care if the toy didn’t belong to him, he just wanted it.</p> 
 <p>“I want to see her.” Sheng Jiaoyang said without flinching.</p> 
 <p>Sven told the butler, “Bring her to Lina.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Master.” The butler bowed and guided Sheng Jiaoyang out of the room.</p> 
 <p>Somewhat surprised, Sheng Jiaoyang looked back at Sven. She was prepared to be put in a difficult situation, but she never thought he would let her meet Lina so easily.</p> 
 <p>She followed the butler without saying anything.</p> 
 <p>After Lin Yan saw that Sheng Jiaoyang had left, he pulled out a chair and sat down, and there wasn’t the slightest trace of worry on his face.</p> 
 <p>Sven laughed, “I’ve never seen you be so gentle when you fight for power. You’ll never get the woman you want if you continue to act like this.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan chuckled and reached for the wine glass on the table. Then, he raised it up and toasted Sven, before gracefully taking a sip from it.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve led her here for you, but you’ll have to be on your own now. I’m curious to see how you will go about cracking such a hopeless situation.” The corner of Sven’s mouth curled up slightly.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, Sheng Jiaoyang was taking the elevator with the butler. When they reached the top floor, she realised that the top floor looked more like a loft.</p> 
 <p><em>Knock knock knock.</em> The butler rapped on the door gently.</p> 
 <p>There was no sound on the other side.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the butler, concern swirling in her heart. “Could something have happened to her?”</p> 
 <p>The butler looked calmly at Sheng Jiaoyang. “Ms. Lina, your friend is here.”</p> 
 <p>The door was soon opened.</p> 
 <p>A haggard Lina appeared at the door. A brief look of surprise flashed across her face when she saw Sheng Jiaoyang, but it quickly changed into a frown. She pulled Sheng Jiaoyang into her room immediately, before giving the butler a quick glance and closing the door.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you here?” Lina pulled Sheng Jiaoyang over to sit on the bed. Sheng Jiaoyang noticed that Lina looked really pale.</p> 
 <p>“I’m worried about you, so I got Lin Yan to negotiate with Sven.”</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan?” The frown on Lina’s face deepened.</p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu, don’t worry. We will bring you away from this place.” Sheng Jiaoyang held onto Lina’s hand and said firmly.</p> 
 <p>The frown on Lina’s face did not go away. “You shouldn’t have gone to Lin Yan. He isn’t the Lin Yan you used to know.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt puzzled by Lina’s words, and she found that she could not understand them.</p> 
 <p>“Today, when I met him, I still feel that he’s the same person though?”</p> 
 <p>“That’s why I say, you haven’t fully understood him,” Lina sighed.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it. Now that it has come to this, let’s take things step by step.” </p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu, why do you say that?” Sheng Jiaoyang felt uneasy.</p>
