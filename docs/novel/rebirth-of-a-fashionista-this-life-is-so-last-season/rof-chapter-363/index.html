 <p><em>What was the worst-case scenario for Lina?</em></p> 
 <p>"I think George must have found out about it already. He has been intentionally avoiding me these days. He claims that he’s on a business trip, but he’s still at the company."</p> 
 <p>"You didn't tell him about what happened with Sven when you returned?" Sheng Jiaoyang frowned slightly.</p> 
 <p>"I'd wanted to tell him, but…" Lina paused momentarily before continuing, "I couldn't say it. I kept procrastinating and told myself that I could tell him the next day. But I was wrong. I shouldn't have been so hesitant. My hesitation made me miss out on the best timing to tell him the truth."</p> 
 <p>"Sven must have been the one who let the cat out of the bag!" Sheng Jiaoyang felt immense anger boil in her heart.</p> 
 <p>Lina hesitated for a moment before adding, "I don’t think that’s what happened. Sven still wants to fool around and continue this ‘love affair’ game, so he wouldn't tell George at this point in time. I think the neighbour next door must have accidentally seen Sven coming in and out of our place…"</p> 
 <p>"How dare he brazenly come all the way to your home?!" <em>Sven must have a screw loose in his head!</em></p> 
 <p>Lina lowered her eyes and recalled some unbearable scenes. Her heart momentarily churned with apprehension before she looked up at Sheng Jiaoyang and said, "Sven and I have done it again."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t know what to say. <em>What Lina did isn’t right, but Lina probably didn’t want to do it either. She must have suffered a lot mentally, so I shouldn’t add fuel to the fire.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took Lina's hand and firmly said, "No matter how much George tries to avoid you, we must talk to him face to face and make things clear to him. If he still wants to spend the rest of his life with you, then you guys should face this together. However, if he doesn't want to stay with you, then you no longer have to bear any mental pressure, no matter how many times you and Sven do it. You can treat that guy as a free boytoy who delivered himself to your door."</p> 
 <p>Lina froze.</p> 
 <p>"In any case, the worst outcome is divorce. Lina, you must have prepared yourself for the worst when you made that decision, and yet you still decided to proceed with it. If you mentally prepare yourself for the worst possible outcome, you will be able to bear with anything bad that happens."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression remained solemn as she spoke, and she even addressed Lina by her name instead of ‘Mei Niu’.</p> 
 <p>"You're right. I have already prepared for the worst, so what’s there to fear?" Lina took a deep breath.</p> 
 <p>"That’s right, let's go find George now and have a talk with him!" Sheng Jiaoyang stood up.</p> 
 <p>Lina nodded and got up as well. She then followed Sheng Jiaoyang out.</p> 
 <p>The night already fell, but they didn’t bother eating dinner. Instead, they hurried straight to George's company.</p> 
 <p>By the time they arrived, it was already 8 PM. They only saw a few employees working overtime. Everyone else including George had already clocked off work.</p> 
 <p>Lina dialled George’s number on her phone, but George didn’t answer.</p> 
 <p>"If George isn’t at the company, then where would he be right now?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked Lina.</p> 
 <p>"A bar…" The next moment, Lina shook her head and added, "Forget it, with so many bars around, we can’t possibly find him before the night is over. Let's come back tomorrow."</p> 
 <p>"No. No matter how many bars there are around here, we can still find him if we drive to the bars one after another." Sheng Jiaoyang insisted on finding George tonight.</p> 
 <p>Lina stared deeply at Sheng Jiaoyang for a while before nodding. "Okay, let’s check them one by one."</p> 
 <p><em>Meeting my Little Sun is the most fortunate thing in my life. No matter what hardship I encounter, Little Sun is always by my side.</em></p> 
 <p>They drove off and visited the various bars in the vicinity, starting with those closest to the company.</p> 
 <p>After searching the fifth bar, Lina's complexion turned a bit pale. She wasn’t wearing makeup today, so her pale lips were particularly noticeable.</p> 
 <p>When they were about to board the car, Sheng Jiaoyang grasped Lina's hand and felt her ice-cold fingers. She asked with a worried expression, "Mei Niu, are you feeling unwell?"</p> 
 <p>"I’m fine." Lina shook her head.</p> 
 <p>"You haven't had dinner yet. Let’s go to the convenience store and buy something like bread, ham, sausage, or anything else you want. When we arrive at the next bar, you can wait for me in the car. I'll go in and help you find George."</p> 
 <p>"I don’t feel like eating. You also haven’t eaten anything yet, so go and buy something for yourself."</p> 
 <p><em>Screech—</em> The sound of a car screeching to a stop echoed in the vicinity.</p> 
 <p>They noticed that one of the cars near them came to an abrupt halt.</p> 
 <p>Soon after, the car door was opened. A man with a robust figure and a pair of long legs stepped out. With a smile gracing his face, he walked over. He looked so attractive that girls would drool over him with starry-eyed infatuation. </p> 
 <p>However, Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression turned a few shades darker when they noticed the approaching man.</p> 
 <p>This person was none other than Sven.</p> 
 <p>"How did he know we were here? Did he tail us?" Sheng Jiaoyang frowned.</p> 
 <p>Lina's lips trembled, and she couldn’t speak.</p> 
 <p>"Darling, you came out to have fun by yourself? Why didn’t you take me with you?" Sven approached them and asked Lina affectionately.</p> 
 <p>"You…" Sheng Jiaoyang was about to speak up, but Lina tugged at her sleeves.</p> 
 <p>Lina stared at Sven calmly and asked in return, "You must know where George is, right?"</p> 
 <p>"Darling, you really know me well." Sven smiled.</p> 
 <p>As Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Sven, she felt a chill run down her spine. Sven appeared like a charming person with an elegant demeanour, but she knew that he was actually a paranoid person. He became obsessed with Lina just because she didn't sleep with him back then, and ever since that incident, he had been scheming and coming up with plans to obtain Lina.</p> 
 <p>Lina looked straight into Sven’s eyes and said, "Take me to him."</p> 
 <p>"So, you’re not afraid of seeing George make out with another woman?" Sven sneered.</p> 
 <p>"Don't talk nonsense. Even if something like that happened, it must have been plotted by you," Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but comment.</p> 
 <p>Sven smiled. "If I wanted to plot something like this, it would have happened long ago, before Darling got married."</p> 
 <p>"Take me to George. I will accept it if it’s the truth."</p> 
 <p>"Alright then. Darling, let’s go." Sven pointed to his car.</p> 
 <p>"We have our own car." Lina was about to board her car when Sven reached out and snaked his arm around her waist, "You have to follow me if you want to find George."</p> 
 <p>Instead of pushing him away, Lina put up with it. She looked at Sheng Jiaoyang and said, "Jiaojiao, you can take your car and get your driver to follow behind us"</p> 
 <p>"Darling is so obedient~ That's the way to go." Sven planted a kiss on the corner of Lina’s lips.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang could only stare at the two as they boarded Sven’s car.</p> 
 <p>When the car arrived at the entrance of a hotel, Lina became even more dejected.</p> 
 <p>"Do you still want to go up there?" Sven extended his hand and stroked Lina's face.</p> 
 <p>"I’m definitely going. In fact, isn't this exactly how you wanted things to turn out?" Lina asked expressionlessly.</p> 
 <p>She then reached out and opened the car door.</p> 
 <p>However, Sven suddenly seized her hand and said, "Darling, look at me."</p> 
 <p>Lina turned to face him while wondering what kind of tricks he was going to play on her next.</p> 
 <p>"From the moment you came back, I hadn’t done or plotted anything." Sven solemnly added.</p> 
 <p>Lina cast him a few glances with a dull expression before saying, "Even if you hadn’t plotted anything this time, it’s still because of you that this happened."</p> 
 <p>The cynical look on Sven's face had disappeared completely. After staring into Lina’s pupils for a moment, he suddenly broke out into a smile. He pressed his forehead against Lina's and whispered, "Alright, Darling. Anything you say will always be right."</p> 
 <p>Lina pushed him away and got out of the car.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was already standing outside.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu. You…" She wanted to say something, but she didn't know where to start, so she hesitated.</p> 
 <p>Lina shook her head slightly. "It's alright. I prepared for the worst anyway, haven't I?"</p> 
 <p>Although Lina said that, her complexion still paled when she entered the hotel room. She saw a messy bed, and a woman lying on it. </p> 
 <p>"Who are you guys?" the woman screamed.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang supported Lina and comforted her, "I think we are in the wrong room."</p> 
 <p><em>Squeak.</em> The glass door leading to the bathroom slid open.</p> 
 <p>George came out with a bath towel wrapped around his waist. When he saw the extra people in the room, he froze.</p> 
 <p>Lina closed her eyes for a moment before looking at George and saying with difficulty, "George, let's have a talk."</p> 
 <p>George panicked momentarily, but he soon calmed down and sneered, "What do you want to talk about? About how you cheated on me with another man? If that's the case, there's no need to talk about it. I've seen it with my own eyes."</p> 
 <p>Lina was stunned, "When did you…"</p> 
 <p>"You guys did it at my home and on my bed," George took a deep breath and suppressed his anger before adding, "Oh, now we're even."</p> 
 <p><em>Pa!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang rushed forward and slapped him in the face.</p> 
 <p>The side of George’s cheek that was slapped turned red immediately. He glared angrily at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, "What right do you have to hit me? Don't think you can hit me just because you’ve helped me once!"</p> 
 <p>"You really think I was the one…"</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao!" Lina stepped forward and dragged Sheng Jiaoyang away.</p> 
 <p>When they were outside, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't help but ask, "Why aren’t you saying anything to him? Didn’t you say that you wanted to come clean with him?" </p> 
 <p>Lina pulled Sheng Jiaoyang towards the elevator and replied, "I changed my mind."</p> 
 <p>Sven was leaning against the elevator door. When he saw that the two were returning so quickly, he straightened up and walked towards Lina. However, Lina stretched her hand out and stopped him in his tracks.</p> 
 <p>"Leave, I don't want to see you right now."</p> 
 <p>"I already told you beforehand what you would see once you go in," Sven sighed.</p> 
 <p>Lina stared at Sven with hatred in her eyes. "You say that you weren’t the one who plotted all this? Then, how did you know they would be here?"</p> 
 <p>Sven didn’t get angry. He gazed attentively at Lina and responded, "Do you think he only messed with that woman today? They have been together since two days ago. I know because I have been keeping an eye on his movements. The first time they did it, you can still say that it was done under the influence of alcohol. However, today they didn't go to the bar, they came straight to the hotel."</p> 
 <p>"Lina, things are no longer the same between you guys."</p> 
 <p><em>Ding!</em> The elevator doors opened.</p> 
 <p>Lina's tears were already on the verge of spilling over, but she stubbornly held them in. She cast another glance at Sven with hatred-filled eyes before walking into the elevator without looking back.</p> 
 <p>"With how things turned out, you must be satisfied now, right?!" Sheng Jiaoyang threw Sven a look of disgust before following Lina into the elevator.</p> 
 <p>Sven didn’t follow them into the elevator. He stood outside the elevator door and watched until Lina’s figure completely disappeared behind the elevator doors.</p> 
 <p>He remained silent, and there was not a trace of a smile on his face.</p> 
 <p><em>Satisfied? How can I be satisfied?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Before, she loathed me, but she couldn’t do anything about me. I would rather hear her calling me a bastard and telling me to get lost than to see her earlier expression…one filled with immense hatred.</em></p>
