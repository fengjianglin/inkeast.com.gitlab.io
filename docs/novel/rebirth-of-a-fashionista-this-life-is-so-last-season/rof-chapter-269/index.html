 <p>It was the afternoon of 19th May when Sheng Jiaoyang, together with her assistant and bodyguards, stepped foot on London.</p> 
 <p>Boarding the Bentley that came to pick them up, they headed straight to the hotel Lina was in. This was also where Lina would be holding her final bachelorette party.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Sheng Jiaoyang alighted the car, she was pulled into a bear hug.</p> 
 <p><em>Such ferocity can never be Lina.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang focused her gaze; it was Rita.</p> 
 <p>"Rita? What are you doing here?"</p> 
 <p>Rita ‘patted’ Sheng Jiaoyang's back for a few times, almost causing the latter to suffer from internal injuries before she said, "Lina is trying on her wedding dress now. I heard that you have arrived, so I volunteered to come down to pick you up. We must drink to our fills tonight! Last time, you girls got drunk so quickly, I didn't even drink to my heart's content."</p> 
 <p>"Rita, let go of me first, I can't breathe," Sheng Jiaoyang replied in Italian.</p> 
 <p>Rita took a step back, then stared at Sheng Jiaoyang with an unsatisfactory gaze and said, "Why are you as weak as Jiaoyang, you are a disappointment to your tall stature."</p> 
 <p><em>Right, my fault!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Rita, speechless. <em>Has it never crossed your mind how strong you are? Not even many men can take it.</em></p> 
 <p>"Let's go upstairs," Rita hooked her arm over Sheng Jiaoyang's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>"Wait, I have to check the three of them in."</p> 
 <p>"Who are they?" It was only now that Rita noticed the three people behind Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"They are my assistant and bodyguards."</p> 
 <p>"You're so troublesome, bringing so many people when you come out," Rita pursed her lips.</p> 
 <p>"You say it as though you don't bring anyone with you. Aren't those four bulky men brought by you?" <em>You clearly brought more people than me.</em> There was a hint of disdain in Sheng Jiaoyang's tone.</p> 
 <p>"How can you compare yourself to me? I'm the sole heir to my father's business. There are many people who want to kidnap me."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang let out a chuckle, "There are millions of people who want to see me hit the skids."</p> 
 <p>Rita looked at Sheng Jiaoyang in surprise, her face full of disbelief, "That's not possible, are you like the leader of some terrorist group?"</p> 
 <p>"You're thinking too much," Sheng Jiaoyang shot Rita a side glance.</p> 
 <p>"How is it possible that so many people want you to hit the skids? Quick, tell me about it." </p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan was walking behind the two girls engaged in conversation but couldn't understand a single word. She could only lament that Jiaojiao was indeed a social butterfly.</p> 
 <p>After checking in, the whole group entered the elevator and Sheng Jiaoyang told Rita a little about her job.</p> 
 <p>"A celebrity? Cool!" Rita wanted to probe further but the elevator had reached the highest floor.</p> 
 <p>Lina resided in a super extravagant presidential suite. It came with a spacious living room, french windows, a mini indoor swimming pool, a smokeless kitchen and a bar top.</p> 
 <p>"Is Jiaojiao here?" The sentence came to a full stop just as Lina walked out of the bedroom dressed in a snow-white wedding dress.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu." Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Lina in wonderment.</p> 
 <p>Lina slightly lifted the hem of her dress and turned a full round, "Am I gorgeous?"</p> 
 <p>"Yes! You are the most gorgeous!"</p> 
 <p>Lina beamed with joy and urged, "Hurry and try your dress too. It can be altered immediately if it's not fitting in any area."</p> 
 <p>"So, Rita is your maid of honour?"</p> 
 <p>"What are the two of you mumbling about? Speak the human language, will ya?" Rita voiced out, probably because she heard her name being mentioned.</p> 
 <p>"You’re the one who can't understand the language but you are complaining that we are not speaking human language. Rita, you should pick up another foreign language," Lina chuckled.</p> 
 <p>"I don't have to be a translator or interpreter, why would I learn so many foreign languages?" Rita rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had already entered the bedroom to change into her dress.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's outfit was also a white chiffon dress, but Lina's wedding dress looked more ceremonial with a long train; it was also puffier from the peplum and downwards. Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang's dress was much more lightweight and more convenient to move around in; the hemline was long enough to reveal the toebox.</p> 
 <p>"Why is her dress white and ours are purple?" Rita pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang and questioned.</p> 
 <p>"Because she is going to be the second bride tomorrow," Lina said jokingly.</p> 
 <p>Rita had no doubts about that and exclaimed, "Cool!"</p> 
 <p>Lina and Sheng Jiaoyang exchanged gazes and smiled. It was then Rita understood, "Great, how dare both of you to make fun of me. If I don't get the both of you drunk tonight, I am not Rita!"</p> 
 <p>As the afternoon approached, a number of Lina's friends began to arrive, one after another. All the bridesmaids had also arrived. Sheng Jiaoyang knew some of them but they were strangers to the current Xu Jiaojiao.</p> 
 <p>Everyone had brought presents for Lina. Soon the gift boxes, large and small, were piled up into a mountain.</p> 
 <p>As Lina had to play host to her friends, Rita pestered Sheng Jiaoyang to drink. It was to the extent that Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't drink any more and escaped by saying she had to go to the washroom. </p> 
 <p>She wanted to head downstairs for a stroll and walk off the alcohol. As Lina's party was held in the small banquet hall on the second floor, it was more comfortable to take the stairs, hence she didn't wait for the elevator. She passed by a fire exit and pushed it wide open.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was scared out of her wits when she saw a tall figure in the corner, back facing the door. She looked closer and realised it was a man and a woman sharing a kiss and the man's larger build had completely hidden the woman from sight.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to retreat into the corridor when she suddenly heard muffled cries. She instantly felt that something was amiss and went forward to pull the man away. The man didn't seem like he wanted to retaliate and was pulled away by her.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu!" Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly grabbed Lina who was about to slide and land on the ground.</p> 
 <p>Lina held Sheng Jiaoyang's hand tightly and shot furious glares at the man before her. "Sven, I am warning you, stop pestering me or I will sue you for sexual harassment!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned and looked as she studied the man whom Lina was involved with. <em>This man is completely different from George, regardless of appearance or temperament. Even a person with face blindness will be able to clearly differentiate the two. George is a typical English man, handsome and dashing, while this Sven appears more aggressive, like a flirtatious playboy.</em></p> 
 <p>"Lina, someday, you will throw yourself at me on your own accord," Sven's gaze was locked on Lina as he stated affirmatively.</p> 
 <p>"Never!" Lina replied rather affirmatively as well.</p> 
 <p>Sven cocked an eyebrow and flashed a somewhat frivolous smile. "We shall see." He then gazed at Lina intensely for a split second before he took his time down the stairs.</p> 
 <p>"Bastard! I curse you that you will have no partner and die alone!" Lina lashed out at Sven's back through her gritted teeth.</p> 
 <p>A peal of nonchalant laughter came from down the stairs.</p> 
 <p>"Lina, why are you… aren't you supposed to be the host?" Sheng Jiaoyang frowned.</p> 
 <p>"I have no idea that bastard came here. Why is he haunting me like a ghost!" Lina was exceptionally indignant. She found it fortunate that it was Jiaojiao who saw what happened and not someone else, and that George needed to prepare for the wedding tomorrow so he didn't come to attend her party.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang gave a light pat on Lina's back and consoled her, "You are getting married tomorrow, he will give up then."</p> 
 <p>Lina's expression changed all of a sudden as she held Sheng Jiaoyang's hands. "He wouldn't come and ruin my wedding tomorrow, would he?"</p> 
 <p>"No, just now he said that you will throw yourself at him voluntarily. If you don't take the initiative, he won't be able to do anything."</p> 
 <p>Hearing Sheng Jiaoyang's consoling words, Lina felt slightly relieved. She knew that guy better than Jiaojiao and knew that he was not the kind to do something rash and barbaric such as snatching the bride.</p> 
 <p>"Come on, let's go back. How can both of us be absent from my party?" </p> 
 <p>In the night, Lina pulled Sheng Jiaoyang onto the king-sized bed in the presidential suite bedroom. For the first time, they didn't chat into the night and turned in early.</p> 
 <p>The next morning, everyone got busy.</p> 
 <p>After changing into their dresses, the bridesmaids put their heads together in a discussion on how to stop the groom and his groomsmen from entering. Lina, who was having her makeup done, was blushing from embarrassment when she heard all the kinds of pranks that they came up with. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, who didn't involve herself in it, smiled and said to Lina, "I am worried if George will still have the strength to princess carry you out of the door after all that."</p> 
 <p>Lina wasn't the bit worried and instead said in schadenfreude, "Amen, our dear George, do hold on."</p> 
 <p>"The infatuated George will surely hold on, he finally got the princess after many hardships, no obstacle will be big enough to stop him."</p> 
 <p>Lina flashed a smile at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Watching Lina's blissful smile, Sheng Jiaoyang felt consoled and pained at the same time. She was consoled by the fact that Lina was finally together with someone she loved and pained by the fact that her beautiful and caring Mei Niu would have another identity from today onwards - George's wife.</p> 
 <p>"Where's your man? I actually didn't see him yesterday," Lina asked all of a sudden.</p> 
 <p>"He's flying over directly today, he's probably reaching a little later."</p> 
 <p>"He seems busy recently. Here I was thinking why he was like an idle person when he had such a big business to manage and even had the time to accompany you to your fashion show. Meanwhile, my George is so busy after opening a new pharmaceutical company."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled, "That's different, George is also one of the members in the R&amp;D team, and his company has only been set up for two years. When the business stabilizes, he will have more time to spend with you."</p> 
 <p>Lina nodded with an affirmative.</p> 
 <p>Time slowly went by, the groom and his groomsmen were about to arrive at the door. Everyone perked up when they heard sounds of knocking accompanied by shouts.</p> 
 <p>"They're here finally, girls! Get ready!" The bridesmaid was bursting with energy and vitality.</p> 
 <p>The first round was pretty easy to get through. The groom prepared enough red packets filled with a significant amount of money and was able to pass through the first door.</p> 
 <p>Soon, the groom and his groomsmen burst through the door.</p> 
 <p>"Wait, it ain't that easy if you want to see the bride. Girls, each of you, offer a cup of tea to the groom," The bridesmaids stood before the men without yielding.</p> 
 <p>Among the groomsmen, there was a very fat man who weighed at least 100kg. He placed a foot forward overbearingly and boasted, "How noisy, George, watch how I open the path for you!"</p> 
 <p>The bridesmaids wanted to have more fun while the groomsmen clearly wanted to help the groom to meet his bride earlier.</p> 
 <p>"Let me!" Rita volunteered herself and waved the other bridesmaids away, stretching out her hands to block the fatty.</p> 
 <p>Rita didn't have a very bulky stature and her size was probably only half of the fatty's size; it was a stark contrast.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the striking contrast, the groomsmen burst out in laughter.</p> 
 <p>"No hard feelings," Fatty cupped his hands together and walked forward, wanting to carry Rita out of the way.</p> 
 <p>Rita reached out to firmly grab hold of Fatty's hand.</p> 
 <p>Only when he couldn't advance nor retreat, did Fatty realised that he shouldn't have underestimated the woman before him.</p> 
 <p>"Oh well, George, we better drink the tea honestly," Fatty said sensibly. Rita then released her grip.</p> 
 <p>But, this ‘tea’ didn't taste that good.</p>
