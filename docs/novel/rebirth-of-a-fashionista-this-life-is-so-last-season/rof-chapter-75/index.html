 <p>“What did you just say?!”</p> 
 <p>The pitch of a woman’s voice suddenly went a few octaves higher, making the housekeeper who was in the middle of cleaning the living room tremble in fear.</p> 
 <p>A young lady who was playing with her cell phone on the sofa looked up at the woman who was on the phone and asked, “Mum, who’s calling?”</p> 
 <p>In her impression, her mother had always been an elegant, soft-spoken woman.</p> 
 <p>The woman smiled at her daughter and said, “It’s Mother’s friend. Mingyue, quickly phone your father and ask him when he’s coming home.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, right away!” Pan Mingyue went ahead and called her father.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Yin, on the other hand, went upstairs to continue her conversation.</p> 
 <p>After closing the bedroom door, she said to the person on the other end, “You can continue.”</p> 
 <p>“Madam Pan, I don’t know how President Pan found out that Xu Jiaojiao is his biological daughter, but he’s asked me to contact Xu Jiaojiao to arrange a meeting for tomorrow,” the man reported.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you give him the paternity test report in person? You’re his most trusted right-hand man, so how could he possibly get the test results from elsewhere? "</p> 
 <p>“That…I don’t know, but I’m quite sure that the paternity test report I handed to President Pan the last time was a fake one, and he obviously believed the outcome at that time.”</p> 
 <p>“He actually asked you to contact Xu Jiaojiao… Have you contacted her yet?”</p> 
 <p>“I called, but no one picked up.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Yin breathed a sigh of relief and issued some more instructions before hanging up.</p> 
 <p>With a deep frown, she paced back and forth in the room. Only after a while did she stop to make another phone call.</p> 
 <p>“Mrs. Peng, is there any news about what we discussed last time?”</p> 
 <p>A young woman could be heard on the other end of the phone as she said, “My husband has already asked someone to handle the matter, but Xu Jiaojiao didn’t take the bait. Not only that, she unexpectedly signed under Entertainment International. It seems that she has a powerful backer, so even if we want to shut her out of the entertainment circle, I’m afraid that we can’t do that anymore.”</p> 
 <p><em>She signed with Entertainment International?</em> Jiang Yin’s expression turned ugly upon hearing this, especially when she heard the last part of ‘we can’t do that anymore’.</p> 
 <p>“Madam Pan, we’ve already done our best, but to no avail. How about you find someone else?”</p> 
 <p>“Okay, I understand.”</p> 
 <p>As soon as Jiang Yin hung up, she threw her phone to the ground.</p> 
 <p>With a bang, the phone smashed on a corner, startling Pan Mingyue, who happened to open the door and was about to walk in.</p> 
 <p>“Mum, what’s wrong?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing,” Jiang Yin said as she forced a smile.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue walked forward and hugged Jiang Yin’s arm as she smiled, “Dad said that he would be back soon! Mum, who called you earlier? Since that person made you angry, you shouldn’t associate yourself with that kind of person in the future!”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, whatever our Mingyue says is right.” Jiang Yin patted Pan Mingyue’s hand and continued, “Mingyue, you’re about to start school, right? When your Dad comes back later, you should ask him to take a few days off so that the three of us can go on a family trip. How about we go to Hokkaido this time? We can depart tomorrow!”</p> 
 <p>“Okay, sure! We haven’t gone on a trip together for a long time already. But, Dad is so busy nowadays, do you think he’ll have time to go with us?”</p> 
 <p>“Your father dotes on you the most, so I’m sure that he wouldn’t refuse if you’re the one asking,” Jiang Yin dully said.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then I’ll talk to Dad later!” Pan Mingyue happily said.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go downstairs and wait for your father.”</p> 
 <p>The mother and daughter pair walked out of the room arm in arm, leaving behind the cell phone that was thrown in a corner buzzing on its own.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue was still young and naive after all. Her mother had, unbeknownst to her, easily diverged her attention and they no longer touched on the previous topic.</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
