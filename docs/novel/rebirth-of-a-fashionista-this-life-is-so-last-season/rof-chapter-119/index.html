<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>"Go ahead and call the driver to take the others back to school,” Sheng Jiaoyang urged Zeng Huan.</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan gave her a worried look before taking her phone to the side to make a call.</p> 
 <p>As Yan Anxuan poured a glass of whiskey for her, Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression remained indifferent. She gently swayed the glass in her hand, looked up at Yuan Neng, and said, “Before we start drinking, do you dare to play a game first?"</p> 
 <p>"Oh? What kind of game?" Yuan Neng’s eyes shone with curiosity.</p> 
 <p>"How about blackjack?"</p> 
 <p>"Ooh!" Everyone was surprised.</p> 
 <p>Yan Anxuan said with interest, “You know how to play?!"</p> 
 <p>"If I win, this glass of whiskey…" Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Yuan Neng. "…You drink it."</p> 
 <p>"What if you lose?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression remained unchanged as she faintly said, "Three glasses."</p> 
 <p>"Deal!"</p> 
 <p>When Zeng Huan had finished the call, she saw a group of people surrounding a table, but Jiaojiao was nowhere in sight. She walked over to have a look, only to find Jiaojiao sitting amongst the group playing cards with the youth who’d claimed that she’d stepped on his limited edition shoes.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, the onlookers erupted and gasps of astonishment filled the room.</p> 
 <p>"Where's the whiskey?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked as she raised her hand.</p> 
 <p>Someone immediately handed over the previous glass of whiskey. Sheng Jiaoyang took the glass and pushed it across the table.</p> 
 <p>"Here you go, down it!"</p> 
 <p>Yuan Neng picked up the glass and downed it in one go.</p> 
 <p>"Young Master Yuan, you’re no good! You can't even win against a woman," someone jeered.</p> 
 <p>"If you’re so capable, then you come and play!" Yuan Neng wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</p> 
 <p>"Sure, who's afraid of who?!"</p> 
 <p>At this moment, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly stood up and said with a hint of arrogance, "I'm sorry, I only play one game a day." Of course, this wasn’t the case, but she didn’t have enough energy to guarantee that she would win the second game.</p> 
 <p>She turned and walked out. As she passed Luo Yi, she stopped and asked, "Are you coming with me?"</p> 
 <p>A trace of hesitation flashed across Luo Yi's face.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Luo Yi wouldn’t answer because she was worried about something, Sheng Jiaoyang turned to Yan Anxuan. "I have to talk to Luo Yi about something, so I’m taking her with me."</p> 
 <p>"Sure…" Yan Anxuan answered with a grin before adding, “If you drink this glass of whiskey, you can take her with you." He poured another glass and handed it over with a playful look on his face. <em>She said that she couldn’t play the second game, so let’s wait and see how she’s going to escape this glass of whiskey…</em></p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, forget it…"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took the glass and downed it in one breath. She turned the glass upside down and asked, “We can leave now, right?”</p> 
 <p>Yan Anxuan applauded and smilingly said, “How straightforward!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang then left, pulling Luo Yi out of the private room.</p> 
 <p>After watching them leave, Yan Anxuan turned to Yuan Neng, who was seemingly still in a bad mood for losing the game, and asked, “Yuan Neng, do you really know that girl?”</p> 
 <p>"Just look up the name 'Xu Jiaojiao' on the internet and you’ll know." Yuan Neng fished out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, and lit it. Afterwards, he inhaled deeply..</p> 
 <p>Yan Anxuan hadn’t even checked yet when the girl who’d come with Luo Yi softly said, "Xu Jiaojiao has become very popular recently. She made her debut as a supermodel. She took part in the National Supermodel competition together with Luo Yi and won the championship."</p> 
 <p>"Supermodel…?" Yan Anxuan repeated these two words aloud.</p> 
 <p>Seeing his curiosity towards Xu Jiaojiao, the girl added, "She’s a top student at F University, and she recently made a teacher who targeted her step down from his post."</p> 
 <p>"F University? Isn't that the same school Lin Yu is attending?" Yan Anxuan cast a questioning gaze at Yuan Neng.</p> 
 <p>Yuan Neng nodded. "Yes, I only learned about her after I saw that bit of news."</p> 
 <p>"Tsk, tsk, she’s got guts! But, that girl's quite interesting. Did she sign under a company already?" The last part was meant for the girl to answer.</p> 
 <p>"She’s signed under Entertainment International."</p> 
 <p>"I see…" Yan Anxuan reached out and pulled the girl to his side. He wrapped his arms around her waist, leaned closer to her face, and asked, "What's your name?"</p> 
 <p>The girl blushed and replied, "Li Shuang."</p> 
 <p>Everyone in the private room got high again.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang pulled Luo Yi out of the private room and walked to the elevator. She leaned against the wall, raised a hand to support her forehead, and took a deep breath with her eyes closed.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, are you feeling unwell?" Zeng Huan ran over nervously.</p> 
 <p>"I drank a bit too much…" Sheng Jiaoyang moderately shook her head and licked her dry lips.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, you didn’t have to do that for my sake," Luo Yi softly whispered.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes and stared at Luo Yi. "Do you know what kind of people you were messing with?"</p> 
 <p>"I know, Young Master Yan is our company’s heir. Our manager called us and said that we had to come here and have a few drinks with Young Master Yan and his friends." Luo Yi’s voice got lower and lower in the face of the other’s burning gaze that was seemingly able to see through everything.</p> 
 <p>Ding! The elevator opened.</p> 
 <p>"It’s not too late if you want to go back now." Sheng Jiaoyang took another glance at Luo Yi and walked into the elevator with Zeng Huan’s support.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi hesitated for two seconds, but just as the door was about to close, she hurriedly walked inside.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression softened. If Luo Yi had gone back to the private room, she wouldn't want to have any connections with her after this.</p> 
 <p>When they got out of the elevator, Sheng Jiaoyang staggered and almost fell.</p> 
 <p>"Be careful!"</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan and Luo Yi hurriedly held onto her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was so dizzy that she couldn’t stand properly anymore. The alcohol had gone to her head, and she didn’t even know where she currently was. In her dazed state, she vaguely heard someone say, “Give her to me.” The voice was deep, as clear as spring, and very pleasant to the ears.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Shen, Jiaojiao drank a lot, so please take care of her on the way," Zeng Huan said with a concerned look, following them all the way to the car.</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm." He acknowledged and placed Sheng Jiaoyang in the car.</p> 
 <p>Watching the car disappear into the night, Luo Yi curiously asked, “Is he Jiaojiao’s boyfriend?”</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan stared at Luo Yi in silence. <em>She knew that Jiaojiao didn’t like nosy people, but since she’d helped this person earlier, they must be friends.</em> After a moment, she nodded and replied, "Yes, they’re dating now."</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi had thought that was the case. <em>Before this, Jiaojiao had been carried out of the hotel and brought to the hospital when she fell ill after filming a scene in the rain. The physique of the person holding Jiaojiao back then was very similar to that of Mr. Shen, so it should be the same person. However, there weren’t many news reports online about that mysterious person who’d taken Jiaojiao to the hospital. At that time, public opinion was also guided in some other directions and, unexpectedly, the netizens also didn’t proceed to look into that person’s background. Perhaps this had something to do with that person not wanting to expose his identity.</em></p> 
 <p>Bang! Sleeping on the backseat, Xu Jiaojiao knocked her head against the window when the car took a sharp turn.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised an eyebrow as he listened to her aggrieved sobs and complaints about the pain, and reached out to hold her in place. However, she wasn’t satisfied and lay down on his lap instead, putting her arms around his waist. As she exhaled, her soft breaths tickled his waist.</p> 
 <p>“I’m feeling so unwell…” she frowned and unconsciously murmured.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stared down at her side profile. He’d initially wanted to move her head away, but his hand touched her cheek instead. He gently caressed her smooth face and thought: <em>With a bit of baby fat, it feels quite nice.</em></p> 
 <p>And, as she was being caressed, Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression relaxed and she fell into a deep sleep.</p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the house in the Northern suburbs, Shen Zhining carried her to the living room and placed her on the sofa. He then went into the kitchen and prepared a glass of honey water. When he walked back, he saw the drunk Xu Jiaojiao nestled on the sofa with her face buried in the cushions. He had to put down the glass of honey water and gently lift her up, leaving her half reclining on the sofa.</p> 
 <p>"Hey, wake up and have some honey water." He patted her on the face.</p> 
 <p>There was no response.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining, who’d never taken care of others before, frowned and extended one hand to pinch her mouth open. With the other hand, he grabbed ahold of the glass and poured the honey water directly into her mouth. As such, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly choked on the water. Having drank half of it and coughing up the other half, the collar of her sweatshirt was drenched with water.</p> 
 <p>Cough, cough…</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining put the glass down and passed her tissues to wipe the water, but his hand was seized by her instead.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes and saw a person in front of her. She didn’t know where she’d lost her glasses. She stared at him with a pair of bright and clear eyes, and she was seemingly sober as she solemnly declared, "I like you." </p> 
 <p>"Did you know that? I’ve liked you for a long time already.” As soon as she finished speaking, her eyes were suddenly moist with tears. Her tears streamed down her cheeks and landed on the back of his hand.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining was stunned. The warm and moist touch on the back of his hand seemed to contain a kind of magic power, and he could sense it all the way in his heart. She wasn’t as noisy as she’d been the last time she was drunk, but she didn’t act like her usual self either. As a result, he couldn’t tell whether she was awake or drunk at this moment.</p> 
 <p>But, the sadness on her face couldn’t be faked.</p> 
 <p>Those eyes were filled with tears and brimming with affection, making it seem as if she was separated from her loved one. She appeared half sad and half reluctant to let go. </p> 
 <p>"Can you give me a kiss?" She raised her head and looked longingly and imploringly at the person in front of her.</p>
