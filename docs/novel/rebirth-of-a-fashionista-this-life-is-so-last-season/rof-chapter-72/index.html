<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Upon seeing Sheng Jiaoyang’s indifferent expression, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but laugh.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t believe me?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang tapped twice on the menu and answered with a question of her own, “Did I say that I didn’t believe you?”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou slightly raised an eyebrow and leaned forward, “But, your expression says otherwise…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips arched into a faint smile and she raised her hand to signal the waiter to come take their order. Gu Zhou was surprised to see that she was quite familiar with the menu. It didn’t seem like she was here for the first time at all.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve been here before?” Gu Zhou stared at her with interest.</p> 
 <p>The busybodies on the internet had already investigated Xu Jiaojiao thoroughly. They’d found out which primary school she’d gone to, and that aside from participating in the National Supermodel show, she hadn’t done anything special. She’d always kept the same daily routine and studied all day long. During her study years, she didn’t possess any other exceptional qualities aside from her good grades. Her past self in comparison with her present self was like the sky and the earth turned upside down. It was as if she’d changed into another person completely.</p> 
 <p>Based on Xu Jiaojiao’s family circumstances, it was highly unlikely that she would get to dine at such a high-end restaurant. Not to mention, Cirrus Cloud Restaurant was one of the top high-class restaurants in the city that not even the average rich person could afford to dine at on a regular basis.</p> 
 <p>“I have…” Sheng Jiaoyang trailed off and recovered after a second and added, “…not been here!”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou smiled lightly and didn’t probe further. He changed the topic and questioned, “You haven’t known Lina for long, right? How come you two are so intimate? So much so that it turned into that kind of scandal.”</p> 
 <p>“Who knows?!”</p> 
 <p>“I’ve helped you this time, so how are you going to repay me?” Gu Zhou cast an expectant glance at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“Weren’t you helping the company?”</p> 
 <p>It turned out that he would be pulled back to this topic again. Gu Zhou laughed upon realisation. <em>This little fox didn’t take the bait!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Although she is young, she is watertight. It seems that trying to catch her off guard is out of the question…</em></p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou then stopped beating around the bush and said, “The company’s affairs are taken care of by the company, and I’m not obliged to help with this. I’m only extending a helping hand in the hopes that you’ll draw a painting for me in return.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang narrowed her eyes. “There are a lot of famous painters in the world, so you can easily get your hands on a famous painting. Could it be that you’re reluctant to spend the money for it?” She cast a suspicious look at Gu Zhou.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou was caught between laughing and crying.</p> 
 <p>“If your artwork could be bought with money, then you wouldn’t have turned me down last time.”</p> 
 <p>The fact that he liked her work so much made Sheng Jiaoyang feel somewhat appreciative. The corners of her lips curled upwards as she said, “A painting that is drawn casually isn’t considered an artwork in a painter’s eyes. A genuine artwork is painted with emotions and filled with creativity. Thus, it often takes a long time to prepare for an art exhibition, because each artwork requires ample inspiration and creativity, as well as the right feelings to be completed.”</p> 
 <p>“If you’re just looking for a sketch made of readily-available material, I can draw one on the spot for you.”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t mean to say that you have to gift one to me right now. It’s just that I want you to give me priority when you create another artwork in the future.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled and raised her glass to drink a toast to him. “Let’s talk about it when I have my own studio.”</p> 
 <p>“You’re still underage, are you even allowed to drink?” Gu Zhou glanced at the wine glass in her hand and added, “Do you want to order juice instead?”</p> 
 <p>The smile on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face disappeared in an instant. She gently swirled the glass in her hand and looked askance at Gu Zhou as she retorted, “Is there a law which stipulates that I’m not allowed to drink?”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou smiled. <em>It seems that he’d pissed the little fox off. But, her current appearance is also amusing…</em></p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, a photographer was happily snapping photos at a hidden corner as he observed the two exchange words back and forth. When he finished taking a batch of photos, he immediately sent them back to his news agency, providing the editorial team enough time to write the text.</p> 
 <p>Soon after, an entertainment news article popped up and immediately attracted the netizens’ attention.</p> 
 <p>[Gu Zhou accompanies his Junior Sister to dinner. His expression from beginning to end is utterly blinding to the eyes.]</p> 
 <p>The contents of the article disclosed:</p> 
 <p>Today, I followed Gu Zhou and saw (Image. 1) (Image. 2) (Image. 3)… Gu Zhou wore an indulging smile from beginning to end. His junior sister, on the other hand, seldom smiled. It seems that Gu Zhou took the initiative to chase after her. Surprisingly, once Prince Charming Gu takes a fancy to someone, he chases after them with vigour! The junior sister’s charm was surely leveraged. At first, she was in an ambiguous relationship with the international supermodel Lina, and now she’s ardently being pursued by Gu Zhou. If this editor had one tenth of her skills, I wouldn’t be sitting here while being showered with PDAs.</p> 
 <p>The attached images clearly showed Gu Zhou’s expression and his bearing. There was a slight, equivocal smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>The comments section below the article exploded with comments.</p> 
 <p>[Let’s drink a toast to this PDA!]</p> 
 <p>[So…Prince Charming Gu succeeded after declaring his love?]</p> 
 <p>[OMG, my eyes…this is really tyrannical!]</p> 
 <p>[I was stuffed with PDAs without warning!]</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>Other entertainment news agencies also followed the trend and posted articles one after another. But, they had changed their headlines and reorganised the contents a bit.</p> 
 <p>After dinner, Sheng Jiaoyang went to the bathroom when Gu Zhou went to pay the check. However, as soon as she came out, she was ‘kidnapped’ to a private room on the top floor.</p> 
 <p>“Go in, Boss is waiting for you inside.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang rubbed her hurting wrist and glared at the tall man standing beside her as she inwardly cursed: <em>Kidnapping me like this…you’ll never get a girlfriend in this lifetime!</em></p> 
 <p>As she pushed the door open, a female voice resounded in the room.</p> 
 <p>“…I don’t care! You have to prove it to me, or I won’t give up,” the woman said in English.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Sheng Jiaoyang entered, the two people inside instantly shifted their gazes towards her.</p> 
 <p>Demon King Shen, uhhh, Shen Zhining, was sitting there with an icy-cold expression. Opposite him sat a foreign woman with grey curly hair, mesmerising big eyes, and a perfectly straight nose. Her features were accentuated by a bright-coloured lipstick. She was truly a beauty that was on a par with Mei Niu.</p> 
 <p><em>Daisy…Stanley?</em></p> 
 <p><em>She’d seen this girl at Grandma Andy’s birthday party last year. Back then, Daisy was pestering Demon King Shen all day, giving her more time to spend with Grandma Andy. At that time, she quite admired Daisy because the latter could, unexpectedly, stand Demon King Shen’s gloomy temperament. Tsk tsk, Daisy even dared to take the initiative to follow the Demon King around!</em></p> 
 <p>Daisy’s eyes were like infrared rays as she scanned Sheng Jiaoyang from top to bottom. Her gaze was a little fierce, like that of a lioness guarding her territory.</p> 
 <p>“Did I disturb you guys? In that case, I’ll leave first…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to leave when Shen Zhining uttered two words.</p> 
 <p>“Come here!”</p> 
 <p>Daisy looked at Shen Zhining before shifting her gaze on the slowly approaching Sheng Jiaoyang. She pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, “Is she the person you mentioned earlier?!”</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” Shen Zhining dully responded.</p> 
 <p>Daisy stood up and walked over to Sheng Jiaoyang. She encircled Sheng Jiaoyang under the latter’s cautious gaze, and straightened her chest as she haughtily asked, “B*tch, do you know whose man you’ve snatched away?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>“How could she possibly beat me in any way? She’s ugly! Also, just look at her body, it’s so out of shape!” Daisy turned to Shen Zhining and added, “Are you blind?”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>Dang! Girl, you’re awesome!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang inwardly praised Daisy for her guts.</p> 
 <p><em>Uhhh, wait a minute, that first part…she was scolding her, wasn’t she?</em></p> 
 <p>As realisation struck her, Sheng Jiaoyang felt a bit of rage rush to her heart.</p>

 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>
