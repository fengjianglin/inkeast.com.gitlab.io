 <p>After George left the hospital, Lina gave birth to a baby boy via C-section.</p> 
 <p>Sven stared at the baby for a while at the beginning. Afterwards, he spent all his time staying by Lina’s side.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang saw this and tactfully went to the nursery to see her godson. She made room for the two instead of being a lightbulb.</p> 
 <p>After watching his godson for a while, Sheng Jiaoyang went outside to make a phone call.</p> 
 <p>After a while, the phone was answered.</p> 
 <p>"Zhining, Xiao Tiantian has been born." Sheng Jiaoyang broke the news excitedly.</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm." </p> 
 <p>"Why is your reaction so indifferent? You’re not curious about who Xiao Tiantian is?"</p> 
 <p>"Do you know what time it is?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the time. She was about to answer that it was around 8 PM when she remembered that there was a time difference. <em>Since it’s 8 PM here, it must be the wee hours over there.</em></p> 
 <p>Fine, she was the one who woke him up.</p> 
 <p>"Alright, you go back to sleep then. I won’t disturb you anymore."</p> 
 <p>"Do you dare to come home right now?" Shen Zhining asked with a deep and low voice.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang chuckled before she casually found an excuse and hung up.</p> 
 <p><em>How can I go back now? Lina has just given birth. I need to stay by her side and look after her.</em></p> 
 <p>Back in the ward, Lina was asleep. Sven was smoking on the balcony. His face was clouded by the smoke, making it impossible for anyone to make out his current expression.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened the balcony door and walked over.</p> 
 <p>"What are your future plans?" she asked straightforwardly.</p> 
 <p>Sven pinched the butt of his cigarette. "Do I need to make any future plans?"</p> 
 <p>"I heard that you carried Lina out of the surgery room when she was about to have an abortion. Since you wanted her to give birth to your baby, that means that having this child was within your expectations. Don't you want to give your child a legitimate identity?"</p> 
 <p>Sven looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, and a moment later, he revealed a smile. "Miss Xu, are you trying to sound me out?"</p> 
 <p>"It's normal for me to try and sound you out. Lina and I are best friends, and I see her as one of my closest kin."</p> 
 <p>"You and Mr. Shen are made for each other."</p> 
 <p>"What?" Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t know why Sven suddenly said that.</p> 
 <p>"What are you talking about?" Lina's voice came from behind them.</p> 
 <p>Sven opened the balcony door and walked into the room. The corners of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched. She followed him inside.</p> 
 <p>"Why didn’t you sleep some more?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>Lina's gaze shifted between the two of them before she replied, "I’m not feeling very well."</p> 
 <p>"What were you guys talking about earlier?"</p> 
 <p>"I just asked Mr. Sven whether he wants to give Xiao Tiantian a legitimate identity. But he didn't reply, so I reckon that he isn’t very willing to do that." Sheng Jiaoyang cast a sidelong glance at Sven.</p> 
 <p>"There's nothing I can do about Miss Xu's misunderstanding." Sven looked at Lina and added, "In fact, the decision lies with you. If you are willing, I would announce it to the world today."</p> 
 <p>"Really?" Lina smirked.</p> 
 <p>"As long as you are willing to marry me."</p> 
 <p>Lina didn’t give him a reply. Sheng Jiaoyang looked at them before changing the topic. "Xiao Tiantian is very cute. He greatly resembles Mei Niu."</p> 
 <p>Sven glanced profoundly at Lina before telling them that he was going to check on his son. Then, he left.</p> 
 <p>Lina stared at the door in a trance.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu, what would you do if George finds out the truth and comes back to find you?" Sheng Jiaoyang raised a sharp question.</p> 
 <p>Lina recovered her senses and replied with a bitter smile, "If it were still possible for us to stay together, I would have tried my best to tell him the truth from the very beginning."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sat down by the bed and held Lina’s hand. "Mei Niu, you have to think about yourself more and live for yourself. It’s fine as long as you are happy."</p> 
 <p>Lina nodded, but she remained silent afterwards. She appeared exhausted.</p> 
 <p>"You should sleep some more." Sheng Jiaoyang sighed in her heart. It was very difficult for people to change their habits and their character. Even if they knew that it was wrong to do something in a particular way, and the correct way to do it, they were already used to doing things their way. Thus, when taking action, they would subconsciously follow their habit.</p> 
 <p>The next day, Lin Yan and Lin Xuejun visited the ward. </p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun had a downcast look on her face, and there was no trace of her usual gentleness.</p> 
 <p>Yesterday, when Lin Yan told her that Lina had given birth to a son, she could hardly believe it. After all, Lina and Lin Yan hadn’t disclosed anything about Lina’s pregnancy over the past year, and Lina also didn’t go home to visit her. She didn’t notice anything unusual because Lina seldom went home in the past.</p> 
 <p>The point was that she already knew about Lina and George's divorce.</p> 
 <p><em>Who is the father of this child? Why did Lina decide to keep the child?</em></p> 
 <p>"Can you guys leave for a moment? I want to have a word with Nana alone." Lin Xuejun glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang and Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>They walked out of the ward. Sheng Jiaoyang looked back at the door and asked Lin Yan, "Aunt Lin didn’t know about Mei Niu's pregnancy?"</p> 
 <p>"I respect Nana's decisions."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Lin Yan, and their gazes met. Suddenly, she realized that she didn't know what to say.</p> 
 <p>They hadn’t seen each other for half a year, but the look in their eyes had changed a lot. Lin Yan seemed to have experienced a lot in the past six months, and he must have polished himself using those experiences. He no longer looked as edgy as before, and he now appeared more mature and stable.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps, they would be able to chat easily as ordinary friends in a few years or so, but now, they were still awkward around each other.</p> 
 <p>"Aunt Lin wouldn’t scold Mei Niu, right?" Sheng Jiaoyang randomly asked a question to break the awkward silence.</p> 
 <p>"No, she would only try to reason with her."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang recalled that the Aunt Lin in her memories was indeed someone who never turned crimson with anger around others. She always spoke softly in a gentle and tender manner.</p> 
 <p>It was just that a mother like her happened to be less laid-back and harder to get close to. Moreover, she didn’t show much concern towards Lina, so the mother-daughter relationship between them was only a bit stronger than that of the relationship between strangers due to their blood ties.</p> 
 <p>"I watched your movie. It was very good," Lin Yan said.</p> 
 <p>"Thank you."</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, they fell silent again.</p> 
 <p>Luckily, Sven and a nurse pushed the crib over and broke the awkward atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>Sven swept a glance at the two people standing outside the door before he opened the door. Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to warn him, but Sven already walked in before she could say anything.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere between the mother and daughter pair in the room was freezing cold.</p> 
 <p>At first, Lin Xuejun thought that the child was George's, so she asked Lina to remarry George, saying that it was for the child’s sake. Then, she found out that the child was not George's, so her expression became darker by a few shades, and she demanded to know who the father of the child was.</p> 
 <p>At that time, Lina said sarcastically, "If you have paid attention to the news related to me, you would have known who the father of my child is."</p> 
 <p>She was a public figure. Although she was not as famous as the top international stars, she was still well known. There was all kinds of gossip about her on the internet, and among these gossip, there were also one or two pieces of explosive news that alleged that she was a divorcee, had a new boyfriend, and was pregnant. Those who followed her news would know a lot about her circumstances.</p> 
 <p>"Nana, I pay no attention to hearsay. I just want to hear it from you personally. Who's the child’s father? Is he one of your co-actors?"</p> 
 <p>Lina didn't want to answer Lin Xueyun at all. Meanwhile, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside the ward, and soon, Sven came into sight. The corner of her lips curled upwards and she said, "You want to know who the father is, right? He’s right behind you."</p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun looked over and froze when she saw Sven. She recognized Sven. Whenever she met someone with such a remarkable identity, she would remember their faces after meeting them once. It never occurred to her that Lina and the heir of the Gudilesi Family were together, and that Lina even gave birth to his child. Originally, she thought that the child's father was just an actor that Lina had worked with, so Lina was ashamed to tell her his name.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Gudilesi…" Lin Xuejun stood up.</p> 
 <p>Sven flashed his signature smile, "You can call me Sven."</p> 
 <p>He turned to look at Lina and waved to the nurse who was pushing the crib behind him. "Darling, come and take a look at our little baby."</p> 
 <p>Surprise flashed across Lin Xuejun's eyes. <em>Looks like the young master of the Gudilesi Family is quite fond of Lina.</em></p> 
 <p>"I'm hungry." Lina’s expression dimmed. She didn't look at the crib.</p> 
 <p>"I'll send someone to buy…"</p> 
 <p>"I can't stand eating outside food." Lina looked straight at Sven.</p> 
 <p>Sven was momentarily stunned. He then revealed a doting smile and said, "Okay, I'll cook for you. Darling, you’ll have to wait a bit longer."</p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun was very surprised after witnessing this scene. She never expected that they were getting along so intimately.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Sven left, Lin Xuejun couldn’t help but say, "Nana, you were so fierce earlier. Men's patience is only temporary. After all, they like women with a gentle temperament. If you continue like this, how could you…"</p> 
 <p>"Don't preach to me. I'm not like you," Lina interrupted Lin Xuejun directly.</p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun choked at her words. Then, she continued with a faint voice, "Nana, you are still young. Men are all the same. It’s impossible to use a child to bind a man for a lifetime."</p> 
 <p>Lina didn’t reply. She simply picked up her cell phone and dialled a number. "Come back, I have something to say to you."</p> 
 <p>"You…" Lin Xuejun swallowed her words.</p> 
 <p>"As I said, I am different from you. What you may not achieve in your whole life, I can achieve it with just a few words. The only thing that matters is whether I’m willing to do it or not."</p> 
 <p>Just as Lina finished speaking, Sven came back.</p> 
 <p>"Darling, did you think of something in particular that you want to eat?" There was no sign of annoyance on Sven's face, even though he was called back.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Gudilesi, women’s mood fluctuates a bit after giving birth. Please forgive Lina for her fierce attitude," Lin Xuejun said gently.</p> 
 <p>Sven looked at Lin Xuejun before he smiled at Lina. "I like everything about my darling, including her fierce temperament."</p> 
 <p>Lina pursed her lips and asked directly, "Sven, I want a majestic wedding. When can you give it to me?"</p> 
 <p>The smile on Sven's face froze momentarily.</p> 
 <p>When Lin Xuejun saw his expression, she was startled and hurriedly said, "Nana, stop being like this."</p> 
 <p>"Darling, you’re willing to marry me?" </p> 
 <p>"When do you want to get married?" Lina asked back willfully.</p> 
 <p>"Next month, no, we can get married this month."</p> 
 <p>More than half a month went by already, so even if their wedding was scheduled for the end of the month, there was only about ten days left.</p> 
 <p>But the tight schedule that Sven was proposing to work around showed just how serious he was about the marriage, even though his expression and tone remained the same.</p> 
 <p>Lin Xuejun opened her mouth, but couldn’t say anything.</p>
