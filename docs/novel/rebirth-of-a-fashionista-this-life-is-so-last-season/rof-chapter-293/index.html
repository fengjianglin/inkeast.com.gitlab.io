 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was hesitating until she suddenly spotted a familiar figure.</p> 
 <p>“Jing Weinan!” She hurried over.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan was carrying a lunchbox to the elevator. <em>Oh? Wasn’t he injured?</em></p> 
 <p>When Jing Weinan saw Sheng Jiaoyang, surprise flashed across his eyes. He had not heard about her arrival. If the big boss knew about it, he should have been in a good mood today.</p> 
 <p>“Since you’re heading up, let’s head up together.” Sheng Jiaoyang walked up to his side and started following him.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan quickly glanced at her, and without any replies, he scanned his fingerprint to open the VIP elevator’s door.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that you were injured. Where were you injured?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked, so as to avoid the awkwardness.</p> 
 <p>When he heard the question, Jing Weinan unconsciously raised his free hand to his chest. The very next moment, he noticed his own reaction and put his hand back down.</p> 
 <p>But Sheng Jiaoyang had seen his reaction, and her eyes widened in surprise, “Do you have an internal injury?” A little further below that area would be his heart.</p> 
 <p>“I only got a gunshot injury,” Jing Weinan said lightly.</p> 
 <p>“…” Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Is a bullet in the chest considered a light injury? No, but it seems that they think otherwise.</em></p> 
 <p><em>It seemed that he had avoided a fatal wound, but he shouldn’t have acted like it was just a minor incident, like an apple getting skinned.</em></p> 
 <p>“Why don’t you rest a bit more? Was it Zhining who asked you to return to work?” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned slightly. <em>Even if he is short-staffed, he shouldn’t have gotten such a badly injured employee to return. Since he was recruiting a new assistant, it must be because Jing Weinan was seriously injured, such that he had to make an urgent hire in such a short time frame.</em></p> 
 <p>After seeing her concern for him, Jing Weinan found her more amicable.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not hard labour, it’s fine,” Jing Weinan replied.</p> 
 <p><em>He’s such a good employee, it’s no wonder Shen Zhining couldn’t do without him.</em> After Sheng Jiaoyang concluded her thoughts, she suddenly felt that something was strange.</p> 
 <p>The elevator stopped with a slight jolt, and the doors opened.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang, signalling her to follow along as he stepped out of the lift.</p> 
 <p>This place was even grander compared to Shen Zhining’s previous building. Not only was it spacious, it was also decorated more luxuriously.</p> 
 <p>As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, a large and spacious office could be seen. The window stretched from the ceiling to the floor, and a solid wooden desk and a comfy executive chair were placed before it. </p> 
 <p>Although the office was spacious, its decorations were quite sparse. The interior had a cool colour tone that wasn’t welcoming, but rather quite chilly.</p> 
 <p>After looking around, Sheng Jiaoyang still hadn’t seen Shen Zhining anywhere. Hence, she asked, “Where is Zhining?”</p> 
 <p>“On lunch break.” Jing Weinan placed the lunch on the coffee table.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had scanned the area a few times, but there were no other doors besides the one which led out of the room. <em>Could the resting lounge be located outside?</em></p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan saw through her suspicions and pointed to the wall opposite her.</p> 
 <p>Blinking, Sheng Jiaoyang walked over doubtfully, before realizing that the wall was embedded with a door that could be pushed open. She turned around to look at Jing Weinan, before she gently pushed the door open and tip-toed in.</p> 
 <p>It was truly a different world inside. Warm yellow wall lights filled the room. Though the lighting was not as good as the ones outside, she could still see clearly.</p> 
 <p>It was a lounge without any decorations or furniture, apart from a spacious bed.</p> 
 <p>And on that bed, someone was lying there and taking his afternoon rest.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took off her shoes and walked over silently. Then, she squatted down beside the bed and watched Shen Zhining as he slept.</p> 
 <p>Unlike when she would normally see him through the screen, Sheng Jiaoyang watched him up close, her heart overflowing with an indescribable feeling.</p> 
 <p>She definitely hadn’t seen him for quite a while, and this seemed to have caused her to contract ‘skin hunger’. When she thought of him, she wanted to touch him so desperately, as if doing that would make her feel reassured.</p> 
 <p>She had not felt this way when she was busy with her schedules, but once she was free, she couldn’t help but miss him constantly.</p> 
 <p><em>I’m not sure if he feels the same.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s nails unknowingly touched the sleeping man, and when she came back to her senses, her hands were already caught by his.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining woke up from the touch on his face. Before he opened his eyes, the first thought that came into his mind was, <em>Which ungrateful female employee is trying to join me in bed?</em> He reached out and gripped the person’s hand while opening his eyes at the same time. He gave off a cold look…</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao?” He immediately loosened his grip.</p> 
 <p>As if having a good dream, Shen Zhining was stunned for a moment.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed, “Surprised?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s legs were getting quite numb from squatting, and thus, she stood up to change her position. But before she could stand up straight, the hand holding onto her pulled her in, catching her off guard and making her fall and onto Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>“What…” She had just opened her mouth to speak, but her face was cupped, and her lips sealed.</p> 
 <p>All his feelings seemed to have been focused on the kiss. Shen Zhining kissed so hard that it seemed like he wanted to suck her in.</p> 
 <p>But the position they were in wasn’t comfortable, and he dragged her up and flipped her over such that his body was over her. Then, he cupped her face and continued to kiss her.</p> 
 <p>Just when Shen Zhining’s hand crept under her skirt, Sheng Jiaoyang recovered her reflexes and tried pushing him away. But like a glutton, he clung onto her, unwilling to let go.</p> 
 <p><em>Jing Weinan is still outside!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang recalled that she hadn’t closed the door when she entered. <em>What if Jing Weinan called Shen Zhining for lunch? Wouldn’t they be exposed?</em></p> 
 <p>But on the other hand, the thought that Jing Weinan was outside was thrilling, and this made her even more sensitive. When Shen Zhining’s fingers lightly teased her, she felt herself buckling down.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining felt her emotions, and he felt the same. All the desire from being separated for so long made the impulse for deeper contact even greater.</p> 
 <p>“Wa… wait, there’s someone outside,” Sheng Jiaoyang quickly said, as he finally let go of her tongue.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stopped for a moment and breathed hot air onto her neck, making her shrink her neck in discomfort.</p> 
 <p>“You followed Weinan up?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course. He’s the only one who doesn’t need your permission to bring me up. If it were the others, they’d definitely ask you first.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining did not take any further action and just laid on top of her, as he considered the fact that someone might be outside. He talked to her whilst trying to calm himself down.</p> 
 <p>“Are… you okay?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked carefully.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s endurance nearly broke, and he gave her a small bite on her collarbone to express his feelings.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang batted her eyes innocently, and she watched him enter the washroom. She bit her lips, suppressing the smile creeping up her face.</p> 
 <p><em>It must be tough enduring that…</em></p> 
 <p>She shouldn't be blamed either, seeing the situation. As the boss, Shen Zhining should be wary of his image. He shouldn’t leave his employees the impression that their boss was an indulgent and unreliable person.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang then realised that Jing Weinan was not around when she stepped outside. It seemed that Jing Weinan was much more tactful than she had known him to be.</p> 
 <p>As Shen Zhining hadn’t come out yet, Sheng Jiaoyang decided to lay out the lunch box that was still in its bag on the coffee table, along with the utensils.</p> 
 <p>She waited a while more before she saw Shen Zhining walk out neatly.</p> 
 <p>Send Jiaoyang couldn't help but lay her eyes on a particular area. <em>Oh, the fire’s out.</em></p> 
 <p>”What are you looking at?” Shen Zhining narrowed his eyes, his gaze fervent.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked away once more, and answered calmly, ”I’m not looking at anything.”</p> 
 <p>”Didn’t you say that there's someone here?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked, ”He left already.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining took a seat beside her, glanced at the lunch laid on the coffee table, and demanded, ”Feed me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang widened her eyes in surprise and turned to face Shen Zhining before glancing quickly at his hand.</p> 
 <p>”My hands are tired,” Shen Zhining said calmly.</p> 
 <p>”Ahem!” Sheng Jiaoyang choked on her saliva in an instant.</p> 
 <p><em>Is he still the Shen Zhining she knew? Could he have been exchanged with someone else?</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stopped his teasing. After learning that she had eaten already, he started eating his lunch, and occasionally stopping to ask her some questions, leading her to talk.</p> 
 <p>”Are you so busy to the extent that you need someone to deliver lunch for you?”</p> 
 <p>”We’re wrapping up now.” He initially prepared to fly over once he was done with his work, but never did he expect that she would beat him to it.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang propped her chin up with her hands and watched him eat. ”I’m done with my schedules, I'm just left with the movie premiere in the following month, and I won't be accepting any more work for the time being. I'll take a rest to accompany my grandfather, Xiao An…and you.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked up. Her last word ‘you’ made him feel refreshed, erasing all traces of his fatigue.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, Shen Zhining called someone via the intercom to clear the rubbish in the room, and glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang as he asked, ”Do you want to take a look around?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shrugged her shoulders, ”It’s not an art exhibition, what's there to look at?” She walked over to the window as she said that, and she admired the cityscape through the window.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining walked up behind her, hugging her and admiring the view with her. ”I’m very surprised today.” He answered her question from earlier.</p> 
 <p><em>Knock knock.</em> Someone was at the door.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around, and in came a foreign employee donned in office wear. She did not manage to hide the shock on her face in time, and this was spotted by Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nudged Shen Zhining lightly and said in a low voice, ”Your employee came in.”</p> 
 <p>”Let her in.”</p> 
 <p>”You don't care about your image?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised his hand and pinched her chin slightly, turning her to face him. ”What image?”</p> 
 <p>“Your employees must have the impression that you’re a serious and proper man.”</p> 
 <p>Instead, Shen Zhining kissed her on the lips and chuckled, ”Then from now on, what kind of impression do you think I will have on their minds?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the lady who was clearing the lunch box on the coffee table and smirked, ”Hypocrite.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s hand tightened around her waist, and he whispered something in her ears that made her flush.</p> 
 <p>”Wait for tonight.”</p>
