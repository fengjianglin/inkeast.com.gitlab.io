 <p>Before Sheng Jiaoyang could exit the car, Shen Zhining grabbed her hand and said, "If something happens in the future, remember to tell me right away. Don’t let me hear it from others."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared blankly at him for a moment, but quickly recovered and nodded with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Looking at his serious expression, she was quite moved. She reached out for his face and kissed him. "Don't worry, I have a lot of experience in dealing with these two-bit methods, so I’ll be fine."</p> 
 <p>Back then, when she was attending that aristocratic school abroad, she’d met all kinds of youths there. During the period when she was ostracised by her classmates, she’d experienced countless wicked methods that she could have never thought of. Her character and social skills were honed there. The trials and tribulations she had gone through with Mei Niu was the reason why they shared a bond that was closer than that of biological sisters.</p> 
 <p>"Better safe than sorry,” Shen Zhining reminded.</p> 
 <p>"I know, I’ll see you soon." Sheng Jiaoyang waved and got out of the car. She then walked to the communal building where Lin Yu was waiting for her.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Lin Yu saw her, he asked with concern, "Are you okay? Was everything alright yesterday?"</p> 
 <p>"Do I look like someone who’s not okay?"</p> 
 <p>Seeing that there weren’t any traces of negativity in her eyes, and that she appeared as confident and as dazzling as before, Lin Yu finally relaxed and released a chuckle. He felt that Xu Jiaojiao had many qualities that were similar to Jiaoyang. If her temperament could be described as a colour, then hers was crimson like a floating flag, bright and active.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu swept a glance at the female bodyguard next to Sheng Jiaoyang and said, "Let’s go, I'll take you to the auditorium where the evening party will be held tomorrow."</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm, thank you for your time, Mr. Busy Bee."</p> 
 <p>"No matter how busy I am, I can't be busier than you. I heard that the drama you’ve starred in will start broadcasting soon. I'm looking forward to it."</p> 
 <p>"You also watch TV series?" Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Lin Yu.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu smiled and said, "I seldom watch them, but since you’re starring in the upcoming drama, I’ll be watching it."</p> 
 <p>"Tsk, tsk, I'll misunderstand you if you say it like that."</p> 
 <p>"Misunderstand what?" Lin Yu asked, half-curious and half-serious.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled. <em>This guy…he’s as green as ever. He didn’t even understand her simple innuendo.</em></p> 
 <p>"I’ll misunderstand you…" Her cell phone suddenly rang and interrupted her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang fished out her phone and subconsciously glanced at the caller ID. She then froze for a moment before saying, "I have to take this call." Afterwards, she walked a few steps away and answered the phone.</p> 
 <p>"Hello?"</p> 
 <p>"I saw the news. Are you hurt?" A clear and gentle voice asked on the other end of the phone.</p> 
 <p>"No, I dodged it in time. You don't have to worry." Sheng Jiaoyang stared at her feet, unaware of the smile spreading across her face.</p> 
 <p>"Are you busy today?"</p> 
 <p>"Our school’s New Year's evening party will be held tomorrow night, so I have a dress rehearsal today."</p> 
 <p>"Be careful."</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm, I will."</p> 
 <p>After hanging up, Sheng Jiaoyang was still staring at her phone in a daze.</p> 
 <p>"What's the matter?" Lin Yu walked up to her and asked.</p> 
 <p>"It's nothing. Let's go." Sheng Jiaoyang blinked and put her phone away.</p> 
 <p>Many people had already started rehearsing on the stage in the auditorium, but Sheng Jiaoyang’s arrival had drawn everyone's attention. Although she was wearing glasses and was dressed in plain clothes with a thick scarf wrapped around her neck, she couldn’t hide her height and unique aura. Due to this, she was recognised by everyone as soon as she walked in.</p> 
 <p>A few bold students walked up to her and asked for an autograph and group selfie. Many others followed, and even those who were rehearsing on the stage stopped what they were doing and joined in to ask for a group photo.</p> 
 <p>"Let's not disturb the dress rehearsal. Those of you who are rehearsing should return to what you’ve been doing. We can take pictures after we’re all done. I'm here anyway, so we can take pictures at any time," Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>The teacher in charge of the evening party breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly asked the students who were performing on stage to continue.</p> 
 <p>Why did so many students want to take a picture with Sheng Jiaoyang? That was because she had long become a famous persona at school. Not only was she a new star exuding a celebrity aura, but she had also captured many fans with her capabilities. Almost everyone at school knew her.</p> 
 <p>The students restrained their excitement and returned to their positions. Only those who hadn’t been assigned anything yet or those who’d already finished their first rehearsal were still gathered around her, asking for a group photo. Nowadays, it was more difficult for the students to ask for a photo because there were fewer courses at the end of the term, and Xu Jiaojiao had someone bringing her to school and picking her up after classes. Most importantly though, there were always bodyguards around her, who stared at people intimidatingly. Thus, fewer people dared to go up and ask for autographs and photos.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang patiently took a few pictures with a group of fans. Once in a while, she would make funny faces and take photos with two students simultaneously, hugging one on each arm. This photo session was a lot of fun and brushed up a lot of good feelings in the students’ hearts. Some students were purely joining in on the fun, but had turned into her fans after this.</p> 
 <p>"…Next, please enjoy the dance performance brought to you by the Poetry and Dance Club," the host announced on the stage.</p> 
 <p>However, no one came on stage. The president of the Poetry and Dance Club was talking with the teacher. "Teacher Zhou, someone from our club is still on the way, so can we do a dress rehearsal later?"</p> 
 <p>"What’s going on? Your performance is one of the last on the schedule, so how come your teammate isn’t here yet? This is unacceptable!" Teacher Zhou was a little angry.</p> 
 <p>"I'm sorry, Teacher Zhou. She’s late because something happened at her home. She's already on her way and will be here soon. She really didn't mean to be late."</p> 
 <p>"Forget it. Call her now and tell her to hurry."</p> 
 <p>"Thank you, Teacher Zhou!" The Poetry and Dance Club’s president bowed to express his gratitude.</p> 
 <p>Teacher Zhou asked the host on stage to proceed with the next performance, which happened to be Sheng Jiaoyang's piano solo.</p> 
 <p>The person in charge of the props hurriedly pushed the tuned piano to the front of the stage. Sheng Jiaoyang smiled at the onlookers and sat down in front of the piano. She lifted the lid and placed her slender fingers on the black and white keys. After the first key was pressed, a smooth and beautiful tune travelled to everyone's ears as the swift movements of her fingers danced across the black and white keys.</p> 
 <p>"I saw a video of her playing the piano on Weibo before but, as expected, seeing it live is completely different from watching a video. Xu Jiaojiao is truly amazing!"</p> 
 <p>"Goddess! From now on, Xu Jiaojiao is my Goddess! "</p> 
 <p>"I wonder if my Goddess needs someone to warm her bed."</p> 
 <p>"You can forget about it, haven’t you read the entertainment news? Xu Jiaojiao has a boyfriend, and he’s a hundred times more handsome than you!"</p> 
 <p>Many people amongst the audience were astounded by her performance, and a number of enthusiastic Jiao fans were born.</p> 
 <p>After playing the song, Sheng Jiaoyang stepped down from the stage.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that there was nothing else on her program, and having witnessed how good her performance was, one rehearsal was more than enough. Due to this, Teacher Zhou allowed her to go back and rest.</p> 
 <p>"Noooo! I haven't taken a group photo with Jiaojiao yet!" A classmate standing nearby cried out in alarm.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang happened to hear it and chuckled. She cast a playful look at the classmate and said, "Teacher Zhou, I want to accompany everyone through their dress rehearsal. More importantly, it’s because I want to watch the performances in advance."</p> 
 <p>"Alright then, it's up to you." Teacher Zhou nodded.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, a girl suddenly ran into the auditorium.</p> 
 <p>"I’m so sorry I'm late!" The girl rushed over, sobbing while apologising.</p> 
 <p>"Shiyun, you’re here at last!" the Poetry and Dance Club’s president exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>"I'm really sorry, something happened at home."</p> 
 <p>Standing with Teacher Zhou, Lin Yu saw Sheng Shiyun's sorry appearance and walked over to ask, "Shiyun, what's wrong? What happened at home?"</p> 
 <p>Tears instantly rolled down Sheng Shiyun’s cheeks when she saw Lin Yu. Her tear-stained face indeed looked somewhat pitiful.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang found this sight rather amusing and walked over to join in on the fun. She cast a meaningful look at Sheng Shiyun and said, "You should tell us if you are going through difficulties. Everyone will certainly lend a hand, especially our kind Lin Yu."</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu, who was being teased, felt somewhat helpless as he said, "That’s right, if there are any difficulties, everyone will certainly help out."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun no longer bothered with trying to win Lin Yu's sympathy. All she could see in front of her was the culprit who’d caused her parents' divorce. When she saw the triumphant smile on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face, she was so blinded by resentment that she dashed forward, wanting to tear up that contemptuous face.</p> 
 <p>The students standing nearby were shocked to see Sheng Shiyun suddenly rush forwards to attack Xu Jiaojiao, and none of them managed to react in time.</p> 
 <p>At this time, the discreet female bodyguard, who’d been standing behind Sheng Jiaoyang, appeared in a split second and grabbed Sheng Shiyun's approaching hand.</p> 
 <p>The auditorium erupted in an uproar. </p> 
 <p>"Shiyun, what's wrong with you?!" the club president asked with a shocked expression.</p> 
 <p>"Holy sh*t ( ‵o′)凸! How dare that crazy woman hit my Goddess?!" Someone nearby ran over and reached out to push Sheng Shiyun. It just so happened that the female bodyguard had let go of Sheng Shiyun’s hand, so the latter was shoved to the ground.</p> 
 <p>"Shiyun, why do you want to hit Jiaojiao?" Lin Yu frowned.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun recovered her senses after falling to the ground. When she looked up, she saw that everyone was staring at her with a strange look in their eyes as if they were looking at a lunatic. Lin Yu was also staring at her with a questioning look. Finally, her eyes landed on the aloof Sheng Jiaoyang, who was standing with her arms folded across her chest. In that split second, her pupils dilated with strong hatred.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips curled upwards. She raised an eyebrow and turned to look at Teacher Zhou. "Teacher Zhou, I think that this classmate’s not in the right state of mind. Will she be able to perform well in her current state?"</p> 
 <p>Teacher Zhou frowned and nodded in agreement. He then looked at the Poetry and Dance Club’s president and asked, "Do you have an understudy for Sheng Shiyun?"</p> 
 <p>"Uh…" The club president was at a loss.</p> 
 <p>The girl in charge of carrying things for the club members abruptly said, "President, let me do it! I've learned all her dance steps."</p> 
 <p>"No! I'm fine, you can't replace me!" Sheng Shiyun started panicking.</p> 
 <p>"You don’t seem well today, and you even tried to attack a fellow classmate. How can you perform in this state? You'd better have a good rest. Since she can substitute for you, let her have a try first." Teacher Zhou made his decision and pointed at the girl who’d volunteered, indicating for the club president to replace Sheng Shiyun.</p> 
 <p>"Shiyun, your complexion doesn't look very good. You'd better go back and rest. You still have chances to perform in the future," the club president said.</p> 
 <p>"No, I don't want to leave!" Sheng Shiyun got up from the ground.</p>
