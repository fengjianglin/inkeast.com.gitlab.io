 <p>Xiao Tiantian, like his name suggested, was a very delicate and beautiful person, apart from the fact that he was 1.89m tall. His face was sculpted like a work of art, and whenever Mum sees him, she would most certainly have the desire to draw a painting of him. And every time that happens, Dad would certainly appear with a disappointed look, and the final result would be Dad’s old face on the canvas.</p> 
 <p>I didn’t want to draw Xiao Tiantian. I saw him for the first time after so many years, so I said with delight, "Xiao Tiantian, you're finally back. Come on, let's spar!"</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian's face darkened. I didn’t know if it was because I called him ‘Xiao Tiantian’, or because I wanted to fight with him.</p> 
 <p>But I didn’t care about his gloomy expression. All I knew was that I'd been waiting for him for many years, and now I finally got to see him. I must show him my progress; I can’t let him beat me black and blue like before.</p> 
 <p>Dad and Mum gave me the nickname Xiao Zhuangzhuang, so they must have high expectations of me. How could I possibly let them down? Although Xiao Tiantian was two or three years older than me, I was beaten by him so badly that I cried. How humiliating was that!</p> 
 <p>So without saying anything further, I dragged Xiao Tiantian to my boxing practice room.</p> 
 <p>While I was dragging Xiao Tiantian to my practice room, I heard Radish Bun calling out to me, but I told him to go play by himself.</p> 
 <p>Whoever dared to delay my happy occasion was my enemy!</p> 
 <p>“They are the perfect depiction of a golden couple," a guest pointed at me and Xiao Tiantian and commented.</p> 
 <p>Another guest said to Dad and Mum, "Looks like your little princess is finally going to have her happy occasion."</p> 
 <p>Yes, my happy occasion was about to be realized. As long as I defeat Xiao Tiantian now, there would be no more regrets in my life!</p> 
 <p>"Come on, put them on!" I stuffed a pair of boxing gloves and helmet in Xiao Tiantian’s hands, just like how he gave them to me last time.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian's expression turned a few shades darker, and he finally said, "This is how you treat me when I come back?"</p> 
 <p>I also noticed that something didn’t seem right. I looked down and saw that I was still wearing my evening dress. Wearing this to fight was truly being disrespectful towards my opponent. No wonder Xiao Tiantian was angry.</p> 
 <p>"Oh right, let’s change our clothes first." I opened my locker, took out my practice suit, and brought Xiao Tiantian the practice suit that Elder Brother Xiao An normally wore whenever he sparred with me. "This suit belongs to my brother. He isn’t as tall as you, so it might not fit you well, but you will have to make do with it for now."</p> 
 <p>If the level of a typhoon was used to describe how dark the look on his face was, Xiao Tiantian's darkened expression was now a level 12 typhoon.</p> 
 <p>"Shen Yang, you are a girl!" Xiao Tiantian stressed.</p> 
 <p>I nodded and urged him, "Hurry and change your clothes. Don't worry, I won't peek at you from behind your back."</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, I turned around and quickly started taking off my skirt to change into my practice suit. Although I’d beaten a world-class female boxer, I did not feel any sense of achievement at all, because my goal was to—</p> 
 <p>Fight and defeat Xiao Tiantian!</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian took off his blazer and wrapped it around me from behind, and his voice rang in my ear, "Shen Yang, you’re a girl."</p> 
 <p>"Yes, I know." I turned around and my lips rubbed the side of his face.</p> 
 <p>I was secretly thinking: <em>I'm a girl and I'm not even shy, so what are you worried about? It’s not like I am not wearing any underwear. People wore bikinis all over the beach, so why don’t you go tell them that?</em></p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian’s expression was a bit strange. The way he hugged me from behind remained the same, but he was staring at me while breathing heavily.</p> 
 <p>"You don't like boxing anymore?" Was it because Xiao Tiantian was afraid that he could not beat me, so he deliberately locked me in his embrace and didn’t let me change my clothes?</p> 
 <p>"When have I ever liked it?" Xiao Tiantian asked.</p> 
 <p>"But you were the one who asked me to box with you last time? How could you not like it?" I was very confused. Why did I practice boxing so hard for so many years? Wasn’t it just so that I could hang out more with Xiao Tiantian? As long as I could beat him, I was confident that he would seek me again to spar with me. And, he wouldn’t find me boring and stop playing with me as he did in the past.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian choked and helplessly said, "Who told you to call me by that damned name?"</p> 
 <p>"What the hell is wrong with the name Xiao Tiantian? I like it and it sounds so pleasant. If one day I stop calling you that, it would mean that I don't like you anymore," I said complacently.</p> 
 <p>At the time, I never thought that such a day would come so soon.</p>
