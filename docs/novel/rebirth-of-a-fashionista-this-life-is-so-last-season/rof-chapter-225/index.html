 <p>The downpour was getting stronger as the landslide became even more violent. Just the sound of the rushing waters was enough to scare somebody to death.</p> 
 <p>The people sitting in the car went silent after recording their videos.</p> 
 <p>In front of mother nature’s fury, human life seemed extraordinarily small and weak.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou sat next to Sheng Jiaoyang and saw that she was holding onto her phone in a daze. “Are you scared?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around to look at him, “Of course I’m scared.”</p> 
 <p>Even though she said she was scared, her performance was much better than the almost exaggerated actions of the other females and the older Xiao Zhuang.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou had misunderstood her. Previously, he had only thought that she was a young girl, a bit more mature than other girls of her age. But now, he realized that she truly matured. Staying calm in the face of danger was rare. One had to be brave to not be scared at times like these.</p> 
 <p>“If I hadn’t asked you to join our cast and crew, you wouldn’t have met with this kind of disaster.” Gu Zhou stared at her earnestly, “Are you mad at me?”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no reason to be mad, it wasn’t like you forced me to come. Actually, we’re already considered pretty lucky. If we had gone just a little bit faster or slower, we would’ve already been flushed away with the rush of mud.” Sheng Jiaoyang leaned back into her seat.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou smiled, “Now that you’ve mentioned it, I don’t feel as worried. At least we’re still alive right now.”</p> 
 <p>“Yep, at least we’re still alive.”</p> 
 <p>The corner of Gu Zhou’s mouth curved up and followed in her stead to sit back in the seat. “What’s the first thing that you thought of when you realized that you’re about to die?”</p> 
 <p>“I just feel like there's so many things that I haven’t done yet, what a pity.” Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at him again and asked, “How about you?”</p> 
 <p>“For me, I just thought that dying from a landslide of rocks and mud wouldn’t be a very nice looking death.” Gu Zhou lightly laughed as he spoke.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also burst into laughter. Movie Emperor Gu wasn’t nearly as serious as his appearance would suggest.</p> 
 <p>“Dying is dying, no matter how bad one looks after death. You have crawled around in mud pits on television before anyways. What are you even scared of, looking bad after death?”</p> 
 <p>“Before, I thought that if I died, it would’ve been from filming a scene or falling from a suspension line or even dying from exhaustion. I didn’t think that I would die from a natural disaster.”</p> 
 <p>“You shouldn’t think so negatively. If you really did die while filming a scene, the drama or film crew will face a crisis for sure. Even if all of your fans only spit a mouthful of saliva on the production team, they would still drown to death. Still, it’s better to not suddenly die and drag others down.” Sheng Jiaoyang teased him.</p> 
 <p>“But now, our filming crew is the one in crisis; from the producer to the director to the lead actors and even all the others have all become trapped here.”</p> 
 <p>“I can already imagine it, before our movie even finishes filming, it’ll become extremely popular.”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou laughed at her self satirizing humor.</p> 
 <p>The entire bus seemed to have been split into two different worlds. In front, the air was heavy and seemed to crush any hopes one had. Meanwhile, at the back of the bus, the two of them were chatting as if it all had nothing to do with them, creating this sort of little world.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I suddenly realized I’m really fond of you.” Gu Zhou suddenly spoke up.</p> 
 <p>“Oh.” Sheng Jiaoyang only noncommittally replied with a singular light sound.</p> 
 <p>“Are you not surprised?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s face had ‘whatever’ written all over it as she replied, “Too many people like me, so adding you to the list doesn't change anything.”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou lost his smile, “You really make people like you.”</p> 
 <p>“What kind of relation do you have with Mr. Lin?” He couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think that you were so gossipy.” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Gu Zhou out of the corner of her eye but returned to feeling indifferent. She felt like there was no need to suppress her thoughts.</p> 
 <p>After a while, she replied, “I liked him in the past. At the time, what I wanted the most was for him to accept my feelings. Then, I could clearly tell everyone that he was my man.”</p> 
 <p>“It appears he likes you a lot, perhaps he even loves you,” Gu Zhou spoke up.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around to look out the window. She didn’t immediately respond. After a good while had passed, she calmly commented, “I don’t regret the time I chased after him. When I heard him say that he also liked me, I was also very happy. Yet, every time I thought of giving him a chance, I would hesitate. My inner heart didn’t want me to be together with him. I would even feel some guilt, as if I was about to do something wrong to someone else.”</p> 
 <p>“Wrong someone? Who is it?”</p> 
 <p>“Gu Zhou, you really are a gossiper!” Sheng Jiaoyang very helplessly glanced at Gu Zhou.</p> 
 <p>“We’re about to die already, so just satisfy my curiosity okay?!”</p> 
 <p>Thinking of Shen Zhining, Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart grew more complicated and let out a sigh. “My current boyfriend.”</p> 
 <p>In the end, the video recording came to an end when her phone ran out of power. In that moment, she was overwhelmed by memories. Scenes of her and Shen Zhining floated through her mind one by one. She realised that Shen Zhining had always been the proactive one ever since they started dating.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, she felt like she did him wrong.</p> 
 <p>“If you have this kind of guilt in your heart, that means you really care about your boyfriend.” Gu Zhou observed her from the side.</p> 
 <p>“Does that actually mean that I care about him?” Sheng Jiaoyang was a little perplexed.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou smiled and acted like a big brother trying to console his little sister. “It’s because you care about him that you hesitated when the man you liked confessed to you. Most people have an instinctive ability to avoid things that’ll hurt themselves. When the two weights on a scale are not equal, you would definitely pick the one that’s heavier. If you are in a situation where both are about equal, then you would hesitate to make a decision about which road to take.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t like to hesitate. It doesn’t feel like me.”</p> 
 <p>“Everyone has to go through this kind of stage. Now, you have to make a decision. Think carefully about what you truly need in your future, and then think about which side would be easier to reject. The one you find harder to reject is the one that you care about more.”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou’s own life experiences were rich with his own unique view on life. His wisdom was more of an intuitive one.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt as if a bright window had just opened up in front of her. But when her gaze moved to the scene outside, she was pulled back into the cruel reality.</p> 
 <p>She smiled bitterly and said, “We’re about to die, thinking about all this is useless.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s true, if we’re still alive tomorrow, it wouldn’t be too late to ponder over this question.</p> 
 <p>Just then, the driver, who had gone out to check the situation, returned.</p> 
 <p>“We don’t need to be too discouraged. We are right behind the spine of the mountain so it’s very unlikely for the landslide to reach us here. This stretch of road we’re on isn’t very steep either, so it’s unlikely that the entire slope will break away. We just need to be patient and wait here to be saved.” The driver told everyone.</p> 
 <p>“Is that true?!” Xiao Zhuang, whose eyes had swollen up from crying, instantly sat up straight.</p> 
 <p>“If you don’t believe me, you can go out and take a look yourself.” The driver sat down to rest.</p> 
 <p>Everyone felt less anxious when they heard the certainty in the driver’s voice.</p> 
 <p>But as the amount of time they waited grew longer and longer, the more distress the people inside the bus became. In the first place, patience was a virtue not everyone had. As long as they didn’t arrive somewhere safe, they wouldn’t be able to calm down and relax at all.</p> 
 <p>From the time that they had been trapped till now, four hours had already passed.</p> 
 <p>In these four hours, everyone’s hearts were nervous.</p> 
 <p>The rain slowly calmed down.</p> 
 <p>“Anyone hungry? I have some food in my luggage, let me bring it here.” Xiao Zhuang got up and was about to get out of the bus.</p> 
 <p>“Clatter, clatter…” A loud sound was suddenly approaching them.</p> 
 <p>“What kind of sound is that?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s the sound of a helicopter!!!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had been a little drowsy, but she woke up immediately when she heard the shouting. She could also hear the rumbles.</p> 
 <p>“It really is a helicopter! Seems like the outside world already knows that we’re trapped here,” said Gu Zhou.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s get off the bus first. Don’t worry about the bus for now, we need to get out of here.” Cen Jin got everyone to quickly exit the bus.</p> 
 <p>As soon as they got off the bus and raised their heads, they could see the whirling blades of the helicopter above.</p> 
 <p>It really had come to rescue them.</p> 
 <p>“We’re right here—” Cen Jin was very excited as he waved his arms about.</p> 
 <p>The helicopter slowly went closer, bringing along with it a strong downdraft.</p> 
 <p>“It might be better if we wait on the bus.” Having been nearly blown off balance by the strong downdraft, everyone first returned onto the bus. They watched the helicopter as it slowly landed on the empty space behind the bus.</p> 
 <p>“Go go go!” Xiao Zhuang couldn’t help herself and charged out of the bus.</p> 
 <p>By the time they had all alighted, the cabin door of the helicopter had also opened and several people jumped out.</p> 
 <p>Charging at the very front, Xiao Zhuang suddenly stopped her feet. Having clearly seen who it was, she couldn’t help but look back.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Sheng Jiaoyang also saw the person who was walking over with a wide stride.</p> 
 <p>“Zhining…” At that moment, she felt her heart contract and her nose suddenly become stuffed.</p> 
 <p>Zhining quickly walked over and brought her into his tight embrace.</p> 
 <p>“As long as you’re okay.” His dark voice had a sliver of delight within it.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang put her arms around his waist and nestled her head under his chin. This was the first time that she realised how good he smelled. It made her feel extremely safe, as if she had found a mountain to put her back against, with no need to ever worry about anything else.</p> 
 <p>“Get on the helicopter first, we’ll talk more after we get out of here.” Shen Zhining lightly pushed her away, turned around and pulled her hand in the direction of the helicopter.</p> 
 <p>The military helicopter’s interior was very spacious. Even with the few of them, there was still some space.</p> 
 <p>Because the cabin was somewhat dark and words couldn’t really be heard clearly, everyone was silent after they sat down.</p> 
 <p>After returning to the nearest county town, the helicopter touched down on an empty, muddy piece of land on the outskirts.</p> 
 <p>Parked not far away were two military transport vehicles, clearly here for them.</p> 
 <p>After they had all gotten off, the helicopter took off.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining held onto Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand as they entered one of the vehicles.</p> 
 <p>That entire time, their hands were tightly entwined.</p> 
 <p>Once they were in the car, Sheng Jiaoyang relaxed her hold. She looked at Shen Zhining and asked, “Zhining, how did you know we were trapped there?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stared at her and didn’t move for a while. Then, he lifted his hand to caress her cheeks. “You always focus on the weirdest thing.”</p> 
 <p><em>At such a time, shouldn’t she be thanking him?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang only smiled and her eyebrows bent downwards as she spoke in a quiet voice, “I just didn’t think that you would come dropping down from the sky.”</p> 
 <p><em>Just like a hero entering the scene.</em></p>
