 <p>With this unexpected turn of events, the banquet hall was left in an uproar.</p> 
 <p>On the stage, Lin Yu’s face instantly turned ugly.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu's parents were no different. They naturally recognized the woman who had been pestering their son. From the moment they saw Sheng Shiyun, they felt that something bad was about to happen. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yu's father hurriedly called for the security to throw her out. Today was the day of an extremely important occasion. Though it wasn't as significant as a wedding ceremony, it was still very important.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun’s appearance also caused Sheng Jiaoyang's face to darken. She had just been feeling comforted by the fact that Lin Yu had finally gotten rid of Sheng Shiyun and found his significant other, but Sheng Shiyun had to suddenly appear out of nowhere. </p> 
 <p>Two security guards rushed forward to drag Sheng Shiyun out, but she resisted violently.</p> 
 <p>"Lin Yu, Lin Yu…" Sheng Shiyun’s hair was already disheveled, and her hard struggle made it worse.</p> 
 <p>"Who is she?" Liao Youlin, the young miss of the Liao Family, looked at Lin Yu.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu usually had a gentle countenance, even when he was not smiling. But now, his brows were firmly pressed together, and he had a gloomy expression. After hearing his fiancée's question, he whispered in reply, "She’s a friend."</p> 
 <p>"A friend?" Liao Youlin's red lips curved up in a wry smile, "A normal friend or a girlfriend?"</p> 
 <p>Just as Lin Yu was about to reply, Sheng Shiyun, who was pinned down by the bodyguards, shouted out loud, "Lin Yu, I'm pregnant with your child! You cannot abandon me!"</p> 
 <p>If Sheng Shiyun's act of barging into the hall only caused a small commotion, her current words were as good as a sudden bolt of thunder that echoed through the hall and caused a massive commotion. The faces of the Lin Family members changed greatly, but they weren’t the only ones. Even the Liao Family members were greatly impacted by her outburst.</p> 
 <p>"Lin Yu, I've never expected that you would be this kind of person," Liao Youlin said sarcastically.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu's brows had remained furrowed ever since Sheng Shiyun appeared. He looked at Liao Youlin with a sincere gaze and asked, "Will you believe me if I said I have never touched her?"</p> 
 <p>Liao Youlin pursed her lips. Her trembling eyelashes revealed that she was having an intense struggle in her heart. She had been living overseas, and had only really interacted with Lin Yu for less than half a year. After getting to know him better, she felt that he was a nice person who was great in many aspects. That was why the two families decided for them to get engaged first.</p> 
 <p>It was impossible for her to truly believe that Lin Yu was the same person as the person he presented himself as. However, without solid evidence to prove that Lin Yu was lying to her, she didn't want to make a rash decision and potentially ruin what would have originally been a perfect marriage. After all, it wasn't easy to find another man like Lin Yu who had a gentle temperament, was patient, and had good looks.</p> 
 <p>"I will believe anything, as long as you are the one who says it," Liao Youlin thought it through and answered resolutely. "So, don't ever lie to me. Even I'm afraid of myself when I get angry. Who knows, both of us might end up suffering irreversible damages," She started joking around near the end.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu was a person who could be easily moved. Originally, he got together with Liao Youlin as he found her fitting, since they both came from similar backgrounds. But now, he was looking at Liao Youlin in another light. He felt that it would be great to have a wife like her. Perhaps he would never feel his heart racing like how it did with his first love, but he would give her his lifelong commitment.</p> 
 <p>"Since you believe in me, I will never disappoint you," Lin Yu said firmly.</p> 
 <p>"We shall see," was the underlying message behind Liao Youlin's expression.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu took a glance at Sheng Shiyun, who was currently being dragged out by the security guards with her mouth covered. He said to Liao Youlin, "Please give me a few minutes."</p> 
 <p>"You will return, won't you?" Liao Youlin narrowed her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu looked Liao Youlin in the eye and said, "I'll be right back."</p> 
 <p>"Go then," Liao Youlin flashed a smile.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu was about to get off stage when someone came forward. He halted his footsteps when he saw that it was Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"Lin Yu, your engagement is a major event. Don't let it be disrupted by insignificant people. Let me deal with my mentally ill younger sister that suffers from mythomania," Sheng Jiaoyang deliberately raised her volume when she spoke.</p> 
 <p>All the guests froze for a moment when they heard the words, ‘mentally ill’ and ‘mythomania’. Many of them showed a look of sudden comprehension, but some people still remained skeptical, such as members of the Liao Family, and those who didn't know much about the Lin family.</p> 
 <p>People who knew the Lin Family knew that the Lins were highly disciplined. And among the younger generation, Lin Yu was the most talented in his generation, and known to be a righteous and upright man.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the skeptical expression on the faces of the Liaos, Lin Yu's mother hurriedly explained, "In-laws, you guys have no idea. That girl's family used to have some contact with us. She has always liked Lin Yu, but Lin Yu has no feelings for her. Lin Yu has only ever dated one girl, who was that girl's elder sister. But that child was not fated to be with Lin Yu, and she passed away at a young age. My in-laws, please rest assured that Lin Yu is a very upright person."</p> 
 <p>"How can our Lin Yu possibly fool around? If you don't believe our words about his character, feel free to go investigate," Lin Yu's father boasted confidently.</p> 
 <p>The words of Lin Yu’s parents helped put the hearts of the Liaos at ease. Actually, before they agreed to the marriage, they had already done their investigations. The marriage was only decided so readily because Lin Yu had a good character, and had a relatively simple lifestyle.</p> 
 <p>After saying that to Lin Yu, Sheng Jiaoyang headed out. Of course, Shen Zhining followed her out of the banquet hall.</p> 
 <p>As he watched their backs, Lin Yu felt as though the sun rays were shining at him in the dead of winter. He could feel the warmth slowly consuming him.</p> 
 <p>"She's the older sister of that girl? She doesn’t look like in though, In fact, she looks more like her younger sister," Liao Youlin commented curiously.</p> 
 <p>"She was," Lin Yu turned to face Liao Youlin. He then looked at the host standing by the side in a daze and said to him, "Let's continue."</p> 
 <p>The host immediately came to his senses and continued with the programme.</p> 
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang exited the banquet hall, she called out to the security guards who were ready to drag Sheng Shiyun out of the hotel.</p> 
 <p>"Xu! Jiao! Jiao!" Sheng Shiyun stared at her, her eyes overflowing with hatred.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Sheng Shiyun, who seemed to have gone mad. Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't help but feel a stir in her heart.</p> 
 <p>It was amazing to see how Sheng Shiyun and her mother, who had such a good hand to play, could be reduced to such a state. If both of them did nothing overboard and served the two Sheng elders dutifully, Sheng Xun would probably have left them with something. Actually, he did give them something. When Sheng Xun divorced Liang Xiaohui, he had given her quite a substantial amount of money, and it was definitely enough for them to live the rest of their lives comfortably.</p> 
 <p>It was their greedy desires that had landed them in such a situation today. You reap what you sow. If Liang Xiaohui had been a little bit more prudent at the start, or stopped before it was too late, things would not have come to this.</p> 
 <p>"What right do you have to hate me?" Sheng Jiaoyang gave her a disdainful smile.</p> 
 <p>"It's all your fault! You destroyed my family! Why don't I have the right to hate you?" Sheng Shiyun had a hideous expression, and she looked as though she couldn't wait to eat Sheng Jiaoyang's flesh and drink her blood.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang let out a scornful chuckle, "If you have thought things through clearly from the start, you wouldn't have landed yourself in such a sorry state today. I'm not going to waste my breath on you, you are a nobody to me anyway. I don't have the obligation to enlighten you."</p> 
 <p>"You made my life a horrible hell. I won’t let you live peacefully either!" Sheng Shiyun spat through her gritted teeth.</p> 
 <p>How could Sheng Jiaoyang be afraid of such threats from Sheng Shiyun? Sheng Jiaoyang straightened herself, and with an absolute advantage in height, she looked down at Sheng Shiyun with contempt. She said nonchalantly, "If you continue on like this, I will send you to a mental institution."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun glared at Sheng Jiaoyang in shock and horror, "You dare to?"</p> 
 <p>"Hah~ Why would I not dare to?" Sheng Jiaoyang lifted a hand to grab Sheng Shiyun's chin as she leaned in towards her ear and said, "If it ever reaches that point, I will make sure that you will stay in the mental institution until the day you die. If you don’t believe my words, just try me. I'm waiting for you to give me the opportunity to do so."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stepped back with a malevolent smile on her face.</p> 
 <p>"I'm… looking forward to it very much."</p> 
 <p>"Devil! You are a devil! You will die a gruesome death!" Infuriated, Sheng Shiyun scolded her viciously.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang clapped her hands and gestured to the security guards to throw Sheng Shiyun out.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun had been influenced by her mother and had many schemes and tricks in her mind. However, she was not as bold or as smart as Liang Xiaohui. Unfortunately, she was still very ambitious and competitive.</p> 
 <p>If Sheng Shiyun wasn't the daughter of that woman, Liang Xiaohui, and if Sheng Shiyun was slightly more obedient, she would take care of Sheng Shiyun, on account of the fact that she was the last remaining descendent of her father.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around to see Shen Zhining standing at a distance. She halted momentarily, before walking over slowly and stood half an arm's length away from him.</p> 
 <p>"I just threatened Sheng Shiyun. I told her that if she dared to continue to cause trouble, I would send her to a mental institution to stay there until she dies," Sheng Jiaoyang spoke in a calm voice, but her gaze was darting around. She felt a little uncertain in her heart, as she was afraid that Shen Zhining wouldn't like this cruel side of hers.</p> 
 <p>Men generally like women that were docile, kind, and lovely. But, if she wanted to deal with someone, she couldn't leave any room for negotiation. After all, some people are ruthless, and if she didn't put them down first, and instead gave them the room to get back onto their feet, it would only mean endless trouble.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was perturbed when Shen Zhining raised his hand and rubbed her cheek relentlessly. He said, "If it were me, I would have thrown her in right now, so as to not leave any chances for future trouble."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes widened slightly in surprise as she asked, "Do you think I'm being too lenient towards her?"</p> 
 <p>"It's okay, just do what you want to do. I'm still here after all," Shen Zhining looked at her and said.</p> 
 <p>"If Sheng Shiyun was someone like Liang Xiaohui, I would definitely not let her off. She only dares to talk big. Without her mother supporting her, she wouldn't dare to do anything. Well, if she doesn't come out to stir any more trouble, I couldn’t care less about her."</p> 
 <p>"Alright, let’s go back. The dinner is about to start soon."</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang entered the banquet hall, the engagement ceremony was already over, and the dinner was about to start.</p> 
 <p>When Lin Yu and Liao Youlin came over to Sheng Jiaoyang's table to offer toasts, Lin Yu even specially thanked Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"I'm relieved you are living so well," Sheng Jiaoyang smiled.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu finally smiled happily, "I hope that you will always be happy."</p> 
 <p>Liao Youlin scrutinized Sheng Jiaoyang. She had an inkling that there was some story between Lin Yu and her. However, after she studied the man seated next to Sheng Jiaoyang, she felt at ease. No matter what kind of entanglement she had with Lin Yu previously, it was apparent that they would only be friends in the future.</p> 
 <p>As for Lin Yu, Shen Zhining had never thought of him as a love rival. Though Lin Yu was once Sheng Jiaoyang's boyfriend in name, Sheng Jiaoyang had never liked Lin Yu, so Shen Zhining didn't find Lin Yu to be of any threat.</p> 
 <p>Other than the mishap with Sheng Shiyun, the engagement party ended wholesomely. Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining embarked on their journey to yet another country after they left the party.</p>
