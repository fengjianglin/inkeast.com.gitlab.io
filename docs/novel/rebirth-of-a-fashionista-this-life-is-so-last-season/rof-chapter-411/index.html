 <p>The boxing confrontation with Xiao Tiantian that I looked forward to for many years didn’t happen, because Radish Bun came in and interrupted us. To be exact, he came in and saw Xiao Tiantian holding me, and he got into a fight with Xiao Tiantian.</p> 
 <p>Of course, it was not surprising that Radish Bun became badly beaten afterwards.</p> 
 <p>Although Xiao Tiantian appeared much more cultured and delicate than Radish Bun, Radish Bun was a useless bun who only had his height. He was naturally no match for Xiao Tiantian. After all, Xiao Tiantian was the one who beat me in the past!</p> 
 <p>The party ended early because of this incident. However, this time, Xiao Tiantian's dad didn’t punish him and praised him instead. He also entrusted Xiao Tiantian with a lot of important matters, so I couldn't see him again for a while as he was too busy.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian also didn't actively contact me, unlike Radish Bun, who called me once every few days. Radish Bun video called me to show me his badly beaten face, and he even asked me in a pitiful tone why I didn't go to visit him.</p> 
 <p>My heart softened and I almost agreed to visit him. But then I thought: <em>Radish Bun is so useless. To think that he would be beaten till he became black and blue by Xiao Tiantian. How can I hang out with this dummy? What if I get infected by him and become weak like him?</em> Hence, I refused him politely.</p> 
 <p>Radish Bun was so upset that he didn't contact me for a week.</p> 
 <p>I naturally didn’t care about this. I was also busy, and I didn’t have time to bother with Radish Bun. Ever since I won a gold medal in boxing, I have received all kinds of endorsement opportunities, and it almost drove me crazy. Was I somebody who lacked that tiny bit of endorsement fee?</p> 
 <p>A variety show director came to find me, and he wanted me to take part in their program. I accepted his offer, as I thought it was necessary to let everyone know that I was not short of money and that I didn’t need those small endorsement opportunities.</p> 
 <p>You asked me why I wasn’t well known even though my mum was once a famous celebrity and now a well-known female director? How would I know? In any case, after so many years, none of my classmates knew about my family background.</p> 
 <p>Welp, our family was just very low-key. But now, it’s time for me to become more high-profile.</p> 
 <p>But to my surprise, this program wasn’t a talk show. I sat next to the director and watched them for half a day, and they were either playing games or… actually, that’s it. They only played games. I was wondering, how could I mention my mum without making it seem too obvious that I am name-dropping her for fame?</p> 
 <p>When it was my turn to go on stage, the host introduced me as the most attractive boxer in the boxing world. I did not agree with him, and I said that Xiao Tiantian was much more attractive than me. Because I didn't follow the script, the host almost couldn’t react in time, but he immediately recovered and asked me who Xiao Tiantian was. I said that Xiao Tiantian was the one who introduced me to boxing, and I told the host that my goal was to beat Xiao Tiantian.</p> 
 <p>The host glanced repeatedly at the director, who put up a signboard that stated that they were going to play a video. Thus, the host laughed and changed the subject by saying that someone had something to say to me. Then, the big screen behind them played a video and Mum’s face came into view. The audience was left in an uproar.</p> 
 <p>Huhhh?</p> 
 <p>"Xiao Zhuangzhuang, to be honest, when you got the gold medal, we were all very surprised. We have been very busy, and haven’t had the time to take care of you. But you have already grown up, and you are already assuming big responsibilities, even though this was a bit unexpected. When I gave birth to you, I thought about all kinds of outcomes, but I never thought that you would become a boxing champion one day. There's one thing I haven't said to you yet. Well done, Sweetheart! Mum will always support you!"</p> 
 <p>The audience all gasped in surprise.</p> 
 <p>I stared at the camera with a proud look, hoping that those advertising companies, which wanted to take advantage of me, had seen Mum’s video just now. <em>Behind me, there’s mountains of gold and silver, so I don't need you to send me any more money.</em></p> 
 <p>Another host was surprised, and he asked me what made me decide to do boxing. I glanced at her in disdain. I already made it clear earlier that it was Xiao Tiantian who brought me into this profession.</p> 
 <p>After mentioning him so many times, I began to miss Xiao Tiantian. Hence, after playing some childish games with the host and guests, I flew back to find Xiao Tiantian.</p> 
 <p>I followed the address Uncle Sven gave me and found Xiao Tiantian in the private room of a clubhouse. He was holding a woman with big boobs in his arms while chatting with other people with a fake smile plastered on his face. I immediately called out, "Xiao Tiantian~"</p> 
 <p>When Xiao Tiantian saw me, his expression sank. He pushed the big-boobed girl away and dragged me out of the private room. When he asked me how I found him, I told him the truth. When he heard that it was his own dad who leaked his location, he didn’t question me further. He only fiercely said, "Don't ever call me Xiao Tiantian again. Otherwise, don't come to find me."</p> 
 <p>"What's wrong with calling you Xiao Tiantian?" I mumbled.</p> 
 <p>"Go back right now, and don't come to a place like this again in the future. Do you understand?"</p> 
 <p>"Then why are you here?"</p> 
 <p>"I'm discussing business matters."</p> 
 <p>"Do you have to hold a woman in your arms when you discuss business matters?"</p> 
 <p>There was a look of helplessness on Xiao Tiantian's face. "Why do you have so many questions? Can I answer you when I get back?"</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Gudilesi, is this your girlfriend? Let’s go in and hang out together." Xiao Tiantian’s business partner came out.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian wore that fake smile on his face again, and he said, "She’s not my girlfriend. She's just someone who pesters me." Then, he told me with a cold face to leave immediately and not to come looking for him again.</p> 
 <p>I watched him walk into the private room without looking back, and when the big-boobed woman snuggled close to him again, he didn’t push her away and placed his arms around her waist instead. With a smile on his face, his business partner invited me to go in. I rolled my eyes at him and left.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Tiantian changed. Since he came back, I couldn’t understand him anymore. Hmph! He even drove me away.</p> 
 <p>I was a very principled person. If I leave, I would never come back!</p> 
 <p>Standing on the street, I felt at a loss for a moment, and I didn’t know where I was going.</p> 
 <p>I thought of Radish Bun. Although he was stupid, he remained the same Radish Bun since childhood, and he hadn’t changed. <em>Forget it. I’ll go hang out with him.</em></p> 
 <p>I video called him, and he immediately picked up. I saw that he was in a meeting room, and I could hear some other people talking.</p> 
 <p>"Yangyang." There was a look of surprise on Radish Bun’s handsome face. He had always called me ‘Yangyang’ since childhood. Zhuangzhuang was too difficult for him to pronounce.</p> 
 <p>"I need a sparring partner now, and I want to hit somebody!" I stated ferociously.</p> 
 <p>"Okay, I'll be your sparring partner." Radish Bun answered without a second thought, and he immediately sent a private plane to pick me up.</p> 
 <p>That night, Radish Bun paid a heavy price for his words—I beat him till he was black and blue.</p> 
 <p>Radish Bun was really stupid. I beat him so hard, yet he was still smiling at me.</p> 
 <p>"Yangyang, do you want to become a princess?"</p> 
 <p>"No, you can't even beat me."</p> 
 <p>"The person I like ought to be pampered by me, and not beaten. I don't need to win against you, but I can accompany you whenever you want to hit someone," Radish Bun said very earnestly.</p> 
 <p>"Then I'll just come find you next time when I need a sparring partner. Why do I need to be a princess? Do you think I’m a child? I can’t be a princess just for fun." I glanced at him and was about to go home.</p> 
 <p>"Yangyang, the world is vast and wide, and there are many places to explore. I can accompany you to all those places, so you no longer have to be alone."</p> 
 <p>I was moved by Radish Bun’s last sentence. Having a companion like Radish Bun who bore hardship without complaints wasn’t that bad. However, I glanced at his swollen face in disdain. "You are too ugly now. I'm afraid you'll scare others when you go out like that."</p> 
 <p>"Yangyang, I heard that your parents traveled to a lot of places when they got married. Don't you want to visit the places they have been to?" Radish Bun once again threw out a particularly enticing proposition.</p> 
 <p>"Alright, but you must wear a mask." I agreed to his offer.</p> 
 <p>Radish Bun happily went to prepare for the trip. I took out my cell phone, only to find that there was no battery left. Thus, I called home with Radish Bun's cell phone and told them that I was going to travel around the world with Radish Bun.</p> 
 <p>Dad and Mum were so surprised that they couldn't speak for a long time.</p> 
 <p>I didn’t care whether they were surprised or not. I was just informing them. Then, I went out with Radish Bun.</p> 
 <p>In the end, Radish Bun was even more excited than me, as if he was a country bumpkin who had never seen the world before. When we arrived at various scenic spots, he’d drag me along to take many selfies of us together. Every day, when we got back to the hotel, he would take out his camera and look through all the photos again. I even started to suspect that when he told me that he wanted to travel around the world with me, he was just trying to find an excuse to visit those places himself.</p> 
 <p>It was not long before Radish Bun was called back home.</p> 
 <p>Radish Bun was really a fool. He was a prince, so how could he possibly accompany me to travel around the world? Haha!</p> 
 <p>Instead of going back with him, I took a flight home by myself.</p> 
 <p>As a result, as soon as I left the airport, I was surrounded by a group of reporters who asked me a lot of questions, and the majority of those questions contained the word ‘princess’.</p> 
 <p>The driver and bodyguards sent to pick me up created a path for me and blocked the reporters. I arrived home with a bewildered look on my face and unexpectedly saw Xiao Tiantian there. <em>No, he isn’t my Xiao Tiantian anymore. He’s Sweit.</em></p> 
 <p>"Hi, Sweit." I waved at him.</p> 
 <p>He got up and walked over. He stared at me and asked, "What did you just call me?"</p>
