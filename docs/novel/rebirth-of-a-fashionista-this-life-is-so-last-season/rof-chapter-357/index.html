 <p>Lina spent the New Year at Sheng Jiaoyang’s place, and left the next day to visit the Lin Family and wish her maternal grandfather a Happy New Year.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang stayed at home, with nothing to do.</p> 
 <p>Initially, she wanted to play with Xiao An, but the latter didn't stick to her like glue anymore, now that he had found a good friend to play with. Xiao An even urged her to spend more time with Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Xiao An started school a year ago, and made friends with Xiao Hu. He was now much more cheerful than before. </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping and Xiao Hu were invited to celebrate the Lunar New Year with them again this year, but the two little brats were having so much fun that they didn’t even bother with the adults around them.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was naturally happy to see this and didn’t mind. After all, this was a happy occasion.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Grandfather Yang was playing chess with An Jing. This year, An Jing had gradually taken over a lot of work, so they didn’t have much time to play chess together. Since it was Lunar New Year, Grandfather Yang asked An Jing to let go of all the work on his hands and take a few days off.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wandered around and noticed that no one was available except for Shen Zhining, so she went with him to his villa next door.</p> 
 <p>Although it was a sweet sight for a passionate couple to just sit together and do nothing, it was still quite boring if there was completely nothing to do.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang dragged Shen Zhining along to play PK games. The big TV screen in his bedroom was perfect for watching TV series and movies, and it was good for playing games too.</p> 
 <p>But after losing badly and suffering defeat round after round, Sheng Jiaoyang called it quits.</p> 
 <p>"Zhining, you didn’t yield and let me win even once!" Sheng Jiaoyang cast a gloomy look at Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>"I have to respect my opponent." Shen Zhining smiled.</p> 
 <p>"Hmph! I'm not playing anymore. Let's watch TV." Sheng Jiaoyang picked up the remote control.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s lips curled up slightly. He placed his arms around her and leaned against the back of the sofa while watching her browse through the library.</p> 
 <p>After browsing the list of shows aimlessly, Sheng Jiaoyang recalled that Shen Zhining was right beside her and asked him, "What do you want to watch?"</p> 
 <p>"The finale of your drama will be airing soon, right?"</p> 
 <p>"Yep, why? "</p> 
 <p>"The final episode has been postponed due to the Lunar New Year."</p> 
 <p>"Oh, that's right." Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining with a puzzled look, not understanding the meaning behind his words.</p> 
 <p>"I want to watch it."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stunned for a moment before she recollected herself and said, "Okay, wait a moment. I'll have someone send the video over."</p> 
 <p>She picked up her phone and asked someone to send her the original video files of the ‘Double-Faced Lovers’. She then projected the video on her phone onto the display screen.</p> 
 <p>"Which episode do you want to start with?"</p> 
 <p>"The grand finale."</p> 
 <p>Every binge-watcher yearned to see the grand finale right from the beginning.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining with a surprised look in her eyes. She didn’t expect a busy bee like him to have time to follow her drama.</p> 
 <p>"I thought you were more into the bourgeois tragedy genre."</p> 
 <p>"I’m not into any specific genres. I just want to watch you."</p> 
 <p>"…If that’s the case, you don't have to watch me on TV, right? I'm right next to you. "</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to look at her with a passionate gaze as he said, "Alright."</p> 
 <p>"Haha, I was just kidding! Here we go, let’s watch TV." Sheng Jiaoyang felt uncomfortable when he looked at her like that, so she hastily changed the topic.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining smiled and turned to look at the big screen.</p> 
 <p>Generally speaking, the grand finale of an idol drama would be when the male and female lead finally get together and have a blissful wedding. The finale of ‘Double-Faced Lovers’ was also inevitably cliché. After numerous twists and turns, the male and female lead finally walked down the wedding aisle with the blessing of the two families.</p> 
 <p>At the wedding, the female lead asked the male lead, "Do you want me to be Zhong Lin or Zhou Yilin?"</p> 
 <p>The male lead looked at her and affectionately replied, "I don’t mind either, as long as it's you."</p> 
 <p>The female lead stared at the male lead for a while. She then leaned forward and initiated a kiss with the male lead.</p> 
 <p>The frame quickly switched to a close-up shot of the two leads’ intertwined lips.</p> 
 <p><em>Cough, cough.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang blinked before peering at Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that he had no reaction.</p> 
 <p>However, she had relaxed too early.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining suddenly whispered in her ear, "How does it feel to kiss another man?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang licked her lips and felt that his calm tone was boiling with jealousy.</p> 
 <p>"A lot of this acting is fake. Through the use of camera angles, we can make it seem like something happened even if it didn’t. We can also rely on stand-ins for kissing scenes. The scene you just saw was filmed with a stand-in," Sheng Jiaoyang explained.</p> 
 <p>She wrapped her hand around Shen Zhining's waist and leaned against him with a cute and helpless expression. "I have you, so how could I kiss another man? All those other men are just wooden puppets and stone statues in my eyes. They aren’t the least bit interesting."</p> 
 <p>It was always good to praise one’s partner when they were jealous or angry.</p> 
 <p>"What else?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's gaze wandered about. <em>Unexpectedly, Shen Zhining likes to hear these kinds of words.</em> She regretted not watching those cheesy sketches every day. Now that he’d suddenly asked her to say more, she really didn’t know what else to say after racking her brains.</p> 
 <p>Since she couldn’t think of anything else to say, she cleverly changed the subject. "Zhining, have you ever thought about what our wedding would look like?"</p> 
 <p>Luckily, this topic was of interest to Shen Zhining, and he didn’t cling onto the previous topic.</p> 
 <p>"How do you want to hold the ceremony?" Shen Zhining asked in return.</p> 
 <p>"I haven't made up my mind yet. On the one hand, I think that it would be better if we go through the formalities with just our closest relatives. A simple wedding doesn’t mean that we can’t be happy with it. Rather, it gives me the impression that our feelings and our relationship will last forever. The point is that we don't have to work so hard. Holding a grand wedding is so tiring. On the other hand, I also want a grand wedding. After all, this is every girl’s dream. I want my wedding to be as good as any other girl’s."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused before looking at him and coquettishly said, "It’s so difficult to make a choice!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised his hand and gently tapped the bridge of her nose. "You don’t need to make a choice. When the time comes, you just need to be my happy bride, and you won't need to worry about anything."</p> 
 <p>"It seems a little early for us to talk about this now. We'll talk about it later…"</p> 
 <p>He stared at her and continued, "Actually, it's about time, let's get married next year."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked and blinked again. She then swallowed a mouthful of saliva. "Umm…isn’t it a bit too early to get married next year? I haven't even graduated yet."</p> 
 <p>"Don't you want to see the people who say that we will break up sooner or later get slapped in the face?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t expect him to say this, so she was momentarily stupefied. "They can say whatever they like. It doesn’t affect us anyway."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned around and locked her between the back of the sofa and himself. He then earnestly said, "I want you to grant me the hubby status sooner, so that no one else can harbour any bad intentions."</p> 
 <p>"Who else is harbouring bad intentions towards you? Daisy is already married, so which other hyena has appeared?" Sheng Jiaoyang vigilantly asked.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining helplessly smiled and cupped her face. Her cute cheeks had gained some meat recently and felt very elastic and nice to the touch. "I meant that others might be harbouring bad intentions towards you."</p> 
 <p>"Towards me?" Sheng Jiaoyang blinked. "No way! Everyone knows that you are my boyfriend, so no one dares to hit on me."</p> 
 <p>"Really?"</p> 
 <p>"Yep." Sheng Jiaoyang nodded firmly.</p> 
 <p>The corner of Shen Zhining’s mouth twitched and he said no more. He just leaned in for a kiss.</p> 
 <p>"You’re not watching TV anymore? Didn’t you say you want to watch the finale? The episode isn’t over yet!" Sheng Jiaoyang pushed him away.</p> 
 <p>"I don't want to see you being intimate with other people." Shen Zhining continued kissing her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was amused and asked, "Then, why are you still following my drama? Aren’t you simply asking for torture?!" </p> 
 <p>"In this case, how are you going to make it up to me?"</p> 
 <p>"Erm… you’re the one torturing yourself, so what does it have to do with me?"</p> 
 <p>"If you didn’t shoot that drama, I wouldn’t have watched it."</p> 
 <p>"…What you said makes sense."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also stopped acting shy. She wrapped her arms around his neck and proactively kissed him.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>After dinner, Sheng Jiaoyang received a message from Lina.</p> 
 <p>She sent over a few photos of Lin Yu and Sheng Shiyun hanging out together.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun looked extremely skinny and dehydrated. She had lost all the luster she had in the past.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang saw Sheng Shiyun’s current state, even she felt a trace of sympathy for her, not to mention Lin Yu. Thus, it wasn’t surprising to see the two of them being together.</p> 
 <p>Soon after, Lina called.</p> 
 <p>"Did you see the pictures?" Lina asked.</p> 
 <p>"Yes, I did. Say, when did you switch your job to that of a paparazzo?" Sheng Jiaoyang teased.</p> 
 <p>"I was idle and bored. When I saw Lin Yu run out without even putting on his coat, I got curious and followed him out. That was when I saw Sheng Shiyun at the door."</p> 
 <p>"She seems to be having a bad time."</p> 
 <p>"What, are you starting to sympathize with her?"</p> 
 <p>"A little, but I don't regret it at all. I won’t forgive them for what they have done in the past just because they are miserable now. They brought this upon themselves. Everyone must bear the consequences for their actions."</p> 
 <p>"That’s not all there is to it."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stupefied. "What happened afterwards? Did Lin Yu bring Sheng Shiyun into the manor?"</p> 
 <p>"No, he didn’t. Although Lin Yu has a soft personality, he isn’t someone without principles. The thing is…Grandfather found out that he went out to see Sheng Shiyun."</p> 
 <p>"Oh? And then?" Sheng Jiaoyang was very curious now.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather and Lin Yu's parents brought up Lin Yu's marriage. I heard that Grandfather wanted to arrange a marriage for him."</p> 
 <p>"With Lin Yu's character, I don't think he will object."</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, if Sheng Shiyun knew that Lin Yu is going to marry someone else, would she go crazy?"</p> 
 <p>"It doesn't matter to me whether she goes crazy or not."</p> 
 <p>"I'm afraid that she would act crazy and go find the girl who is supposed to marry Lin Yu. If she does something crazy then, won't she ruin the other girl’s life?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was silent for a moment. <em>What Lina said was right. That crazy woman is more than capable of that.</em> Although she didn't want to be a savior, she couldn't bear to watch another innocent girl be implicated in this.</p> 
 <p><em>With Sheng Shiyun's increasingly extreme behaviour, she might really go and harm Lin Yu’s future wife.</em></p> 
 <p>When she recalled the time when she was splashed with hydrochloric acid, she still felt some lingering fears.</p> 
 <p>"You can ask your grandfather to keep an eye on this matter. Don’t let this prospective marriage fail, and end up with an enemy instead."</p> 
 <p>"Yeah, I'll remind Grandfather."</p> 
 <p>After chatting for a while, Lina said that she would stay for two more days at the Lin Family before she returns overseas.</p> 
 <p>"The marks on your body are gone?"</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm.”</p> 
 <p>Just when Sheng Jiaoyang thought that Lina didn’t want to delve on this matter any further, she heard her say in an earnest manner, "Jiaojiao, I have decided to go back and have a good talk with George. I…don’t want to hide anything from him."</p>
