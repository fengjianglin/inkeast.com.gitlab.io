 <p>When the show’s director told the three couples that Xu Jiaojiao and her boyfriend would be joining them for an episode as a special guest, there were mixed feelings. However, under the camera’s spotlight, they all revealed expressions of excitement. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining walked out, and they were welcomed by the three couples and the director. </p> 
 <p>“Welcome!!”</p> 
 <p>“Hello everyone, I’m Xu Jiaojiao and this is my…” Sheng Jiaoyang hadn’t finished her introduction when she was interrupted by Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>“Fiancé,” he said. </p> 
 <p>Everyone glanced at each other. <em>How possessive!!</em></p> 
 <p>“Every couple has a team name. Liu Qian and Peng Jiang’s team name is <em>Team Bickering</em>, Man Zi and Yang Zichu’s is <em>Team Gemini</em>, and Yao Yao and Deng Renlong’s is <em>Team Bewitching</em>. Jiaojiao, you two also have to think of a team name,” the director said. </p> 
 <p>“I think <em>The Beauties</em> would be quite fitting,” Liu Qian smiled. </p> 
 <p>“I think <em>Team Super Tall</em> would be better, they’re both so tall,” Peng Jiang subconsciously retorted Liu Qian. </p> 
 <p>“What’s the use of calling them ‘Super Tall’?” Liu Qian fought back. </p> 
 <p>Man Zi chuckled as he said, “Stop it, you two. Let them decide their own team name. What are you guys adding blindly for?” </p> 
 <p>“I think Team Super Tall is not bad, let’s just use that,” Sheng Jiaoyang said. </p> 
 <p>The newly added Team Super Tall already finished parachuting, so the other three couples got onto the helicopter to jump. </p> 
 <p>Yao Yao was the young girl who almost ran into Sheng Jiaoyang earlier. She and her boyfriend Deng Renlong drew ballots, and they were the last pair to jump, so she pulled Deng Renlong over to chat with Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, how long are you guys planning to stay for?” </p> 
 <p>“I’ll see.” </p> 
 <p>“Mr. Shen isn’t busy with work?”</p> 
 <p>“No, it’s alright.” </p> 
 <p>“I’m really curious, Jiaojiao. How did you two meet? Can you tell us?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was secretly getting frustrated since Yao Yao couldn’t take the hint and kept bombarding her with questions, but she wouldn’t do anything that might give people an excuse to trash talk her. She was just about to reply when Shen Zhining suddenly stood up. </p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>“You’re probably hungry after jumping, so let’s go eat something.” </p> 
 <p>“Alright.” Sheng Jiaoyang also stood up and glanced at Yao Yao and her boyfriend, “Want to eat together?” </p> 
 <p>Yao Yao was just about to agree when Deng Renlong pulled her aside and said, “We’re about to jump soon, so it’s better not to eat right now. Let’s eat at some other time.” </p> 
 <p>Only then did Yao Yao stop. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pulled Shen Zhining’s hand and left. </p> 
 <p>While they were eating, the first couple to jump, Team Bickering, also came to eat. </p> 
 <p>“That was really exciting!” Liu Qian pulled Peng Jiang along, and they sat across Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed when she noticed how pale Peng Jiang’s face was and how bright Liu Qian’s was. She giggled and said to the couple, “Today’s jump will definitely be unforgettable to your husband.” </p> 
 <p>Liu Qian turned to glance at Peng Jiang with a face filled with disdain. “Seriously, I’ve never seen a more cowardly man than you. Look at Mr. Shen, he could even carry his girlfriend up after he landed. Meanwhile, I had to help you walk.” </p> 
 <p>Peng Jiang rolled his eyes and replied powerlessly, “Please, I have a fear of heights. It’s already a miracle that I didn’t faint, okay?” </p> 
 <p>“You aren’t even as good as me. Aren’t you ashamed?”</p> 
 <p>“You’re a tomboy!” </p> 
 <p>“Then what are you, a pansy?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed as she watched the couple bicker. “Were you two like this from the beginning?” </p> 
 <p>“Of course not, if he dared to argue with me when I met him, there was no way in hell I would’ve married him!” Liu Qian turned her head like a tsundere. </p> 
 <p>Peng Jiang sneered, “I should be the one saying that.” </p> 
 <p>These two really deserved to be called Team Bickering! Sheng Jiaoyang found it interesting, and she glanced at Shen Zhining, wondering if they would become like Liu Qian and Peng Jiang. </p> 
 <p>His hand moved down to hold her hand that was resting on her thigh. His fingers rubbed her palm and gave her an itchy feeling. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked and looked at Shen Zhining, using her eyes to ask what he was doing. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining also looked at her silently. Because of his German blood, he had profound facial features. His eyes contained deep emotion as he gazed at her, and he appeared especially enchanting. </p> 
 <p>From the side, the director and the cameraman recorded all their actions on camera. </p> 
 <p>Liu Qian winked at Peng Jiang and accidentally dropped her phone on the floor. When she bent over to pick it up, she couldn’t help but see that the two had joined hands. Hence, she didn’t immediately get up. Instead, from under the table, she attracted the attention of the director who was filming her. Soon, the director also crouched down to take a look and saw their interlocked hands.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing?” Peng Jiang looked at Liu Qian suspiciously. </p> 
 <p>Liu Qian smiled mischievously as she said meaningfully, “I wish I was young again!” </p> 
 <p>“What are you trying to say?” </p> 
 <p>“I’m just saying. Look at us, a pair of old husband and wife who just squabble all day long. Then, look at those two young’uns! Sigh, how unlucky I am!”</p> 
 <p>“What, are you dissatisfied with your current life?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course not, I’m very satisfied! Isn’t our son adorable?” Liu Qian hastily said. </p> 
 <p>Peng Jiang revealed a satisfied smile. </p> 
 <p>Very soon, they were joined by the two other couples. The director called the four pairs together to play a lover’s test. They would rely on their mutual understanding of each other to decide their rankings, which would determine how luxurious or average their dinner would be.</p> 
 <p>Everybody was given a clipboard and they sat across from their partner. </p> 
 <p>The director drew a question.</p> 
 <p>Question One, “Where was your first meeting?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Shen Zhining and wrote down two words on the clipboard: <em>My house.</em></p> 
 <p>When it was time to reveal the answers, three of the four couples were right. Only Liu Qian and Peng Jiang answered incorrectly—one said they first met at the bar, while the other said they met at a dinner party. </p> 
 <p>“Why did you two get this question wrong? It was supposed to be free points. You two have known each other the longest out of everyone here.” The director was curious. </p> 
 <p>Liu Qian glared at Peng Jiang, “What the hell are you doing, wasn’t our first meeting at the bar?”</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean? I first met you at a dinner party!” Peng Jiang denied.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, so the reason why you accepted my confession so frankly at the bar was actually because you’ve met me before,” Liu Qian’s face was filled with wonder.</p> 
 <p>Everybody stared at the two. <em>What a big misunderstanding…</em></p> 
 <p>“Liu Qian, I really didn’t expect you’d take the initiative to ask Peng Jiang out at your first meeting?! Whew, no wonder you’re Liu Qian!” Yao Yao said with a laugh. </p> 
 <p>“Of course! If I like somebody, I’d naturally tell them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be the one with him today,” Liu Qian raised her chin and spoke proudly. </p> 
 <p>At this point, Peng Jiang said something very romantic, “Honey, even if you didn’t confess to me, you would still be the one with me today. I would’ve been the one who confessed.” </p> 
 <p>Liu Qian couldn’t hide her smile. </p> 
 <p>The other two couples started to chant, calling for the two to kiss. Liu Qian and Peng Jiang didn’t let them down. They reached across the table to meet lips. </p> 
 <p>“I’m really curious, Jiaojiao. How was your first meeting at your house?” Yao Yao glanced around as she asked. </p> 
 <p>The others also heard Yao Yao’s question, and they were all wondering the same. </p> 
 <p>“Yeah, we met when we were very young.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled slightly. </p> 
 <p>“Wow, childhood sweethearts. How fortunate!” Yang Zichu exclaimed in surprise. </p> 
 <p>“The second question is also free points. Who was the first to confess?” the director continued to ask. </p> 
 <p>This question really was free points. It was so simple that everybody got it correct.</p> 
 <p>“The third question: girls, what did your boyfriend do that moved your heart the most?” </p> 
 <p>This question was clearly difficult. </p> 
 <p>Only Team Bickering got this question right. The other three couples got it all wrong. </p> 
 <p>“Haha, I really didn’t expect only we’d get this right,” Liu Qian laughed happily. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the word ‘Proposal’ on Shen Zhining’s sheet and Shen Zhining looked at her answer, ‘Riding a helicopter to save me’. With just a glance, he knew what she was referring to. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, what do you mean by ‘riding a helicopter to save me’?” Liu Qian was sitting beside Sheng Jiaoyang and could easily see her answer. </p> 
 <p>Everyone else also looked over. Things like the hero saving the beauty were always attractive, especially an interesting story like riding a helicopter to save somebody.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, many people know about this. When I was filming ‘Frost at Dawn’, the crew and I returned to the mountains to redo some scenes. However, a big rainstorm broke out that day, and we were trapped on the mountainous road. Right in front of us was a landslide, and behind us was a mudslide. Furthermore, none of our phones had any signal,” Sheng Jiaoyang slowly recalled. </p> 
 <p>Everybody listened in fright.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled and looked at Shen Zhining, “At that time, if you didn’t come flying over in a helicopter, I don’t think we would be alive right now.” </p> 
 <p>“Wow, dropping from the sky to save you! Hehe, did you think he was especially handsome then?” Liu Qian teased. </p> 
 <p>“Yeah, very handsome,” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her, and his lips gradually curved into a smile. </p> 
 <p>“Mr. Shen, how did you know something happened to Jiaojiao?” Yao Yao continued to ask. </p> 
 <p>“Do you even need to ask? It’s definitely his instincts screaming from the bond shared between lovers!” Liu Qian said. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining only smiled. He didn’t need to tell others about it. </p> 
 <p>“The fourth question is: when and where did you share your first kiss?” The director promptly changed the topic back to the game. </p> 
 <p>“Director, what do you mean by first kiss? Does just touching lips count?” Yang Zichu asked. </p> 
 <p>The director choked, “It counts if it’s over two seconds.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Shen Zhining, only to discover that he was also looking at her. She hurriedly looked down and pretended to write her answer. In fact, she had long recalled the first time she and Shen Zhining kissed. She remembered it should be that time, after the feast at her in-laws. Somebody splashed wine on her, and after she returned to the hotel room and got a change of clothes, she was fiercely kissed by him in the corridor.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, show your answers.” The director saw that everyone had finished writing. </p> 
 <p>After seeing everyone’s answers, the director announced, “This round, only Team Super Tall didn’t have matching answers.” </p>
