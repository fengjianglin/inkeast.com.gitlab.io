 <p>Many people who came around after getting drunk had no idea about what happened when they were drunk. It was the same for Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>When she woke up, she could only feel her body aching all over, and she felt lethargic. Her body was silently attesting to the madness of the previous night. </p> 
 <p>Before she could open her eyes, she felt a slight wobble and could even hear car honking sounds.</p> 
 <p>She opened her eyes in a daze and saw Shen Zhining's chiseled chin.</p> 
 <p>"Where are we going?" She narrowed her eyes and looked out of the car window.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining lowered his head and lifted a hand to gently caress her cheek, "Didn't you say there were many places you wanted to visit? It happens that you don't have any work scheduled or classes to attend, so we can make a trip around."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes widened and glittered like the stars in the starry night. The confusion in them had dissipated.</p> 
 <p>Clearly, she was looking forward to what Shen Zhining just said. Previously, she was in poor health, so despite having the heart to travel the world, she wasn't able to execute it. But now, the timing was just right.</p> 
 <p>Instantly, her heart was filled with such longing for this trip that she conveniently forgot to question him about what he did to her while she was drunk.</p> 
 <p>As for Shen Zhining, he felt that it was the right time for them to get out for a trip as well. They could reconnect with each other through the trip, and he could use this chance to get her away from the production crews and the invitations to appear on shows, so that he could enjoy their time together without being disturbed.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining moved so swiftly that even Xu Ping and the rest hadn't received any news. When they tried to look for Sheng Jiaoyang, she was already out of the country. After asking them about it, they found out that the couple had gone traveling again and wouldn't be back so soon.</p> 
 <p>Xu Ping was forced to return all the scripts that she had received, and she even had to send out a notice on her personal social media account.</p> 
 <p>Xu Ping: <em>Jiao has gone traveling with her partner again. Her upcoming schedule is undecided.</em></p> 
 <p>A stir was roused in the comments section.</p> 
 <p>Jiao Fans appeared in droves, and her other celebrity friends also joined in the commotion.</p> 
 <p>[My Jiao is so awesome! I remember that she only wrapped up her filming yesterday, and she has flown off again today?]</p> 
 <p>[Traveling with Mr. Shen again, how blissful!]</p> 
 <p>[Does that mean I have to wait for a long time to see my Jiao again?]</p> 
 <p>[Now we have to go all over the world to find glimpses of Jiaojiao again? Ever get that feeling of Déjà vu?]</p> 
 <p>[OMG, Xu Jiaojiao is not attending to her duties again! Great! I don't have to worry about her snatching the lead actress role away from our idol.]</p> 
 <p>[It's time for ‘Let's Find Jiao’ again.]</p> 
 <p>[Oh oh oh oh, again again again again…] </p> 
 <p>[What happened? Why is the whole feed filled with the word ‘again’?]</p> 
 <p>Starting from Xu Ping's post, every comment would definitely contain the word ‘again’. Everyone had mischievously pointed out the word, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p> 
 <p>At a certain filming site, Ye Zi was also taking advantage of her break time to browse her Weibo to like and leave comments on Xu Ping's post.</p> 
 <p>An actress in a servant's dress walked towards her and called out, "Ye Zi."</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi’s assistant, who was seated beside her, narrowed her eyes when she heard the actress’ voice, and a trace of impatience flashed across the recesses of her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi looked up and flashed a smile upon seeing the woman before her, "Xiaoxiao, come take a seat."</p> 
 <p>Xiaoxiao sat down beside Ye Zi. She threw a glance at Ye Zi's assistant before she peeked at Ye Zi's phone and very casually asked, "What are you doing?"</p> 
 <p>"Browsing Weibo. Are you done with your scenes?"</p> 
 <p>"I'm just a servant, and all I do is stand there as a background. Unlike you, you can use a stand-in when they don't need to take any frontal shots."</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi comforted, "Although An Yu is a servant, she has quite a lot of screen time throughout the whole series. She's also an important character."</p> 
 <p>"No matter how important it is, it's still just the role of a servant. Previously, I could still play the second wife or concubine, but now I have regressed into playing the role of a servant. In the past, you used to act as my servant, but now, I'm acting as your servant," Xiaoxiao had a bitter expression on her face.</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi was at a sudden loss of words. She had helped Xiaoxiao get the role of the servant, but now, it seemed like Xiaoxiao wasn't satisfied with the role.</p> 
 <p>As they were friends, Ye Zi found it awkward to comment on this issue, but her assistant couldn't take it lying down any longer.</p> 
 <p>"At the start, there were many people who came to audition for the role of An Yu. You know, in the original light novel, An Yu had more screen time than the second female lead and was a good character. Eventually, she even sacrificed her life for the female lead. If she was portrayed well, she could gain the support of the audience. Our Ye Zi pulled many strings to get this role for you, Miss Zhu. If you really look down on this role, we can change you out at any time. After all, filming has only just commenced," Ye Zi's assistant said with a cold smile.</p> 
 <p>Xiaoxiao's expression stiffened before she squeezed out a smile. Holding Ye Zi's hand, she said, "Ye Zi, I'm not looking down on this role. We have been friends for so many years, you know me well, don't you? I'm only lamenting to you because I think of you as my best friend."</p> 
 <p>"Xiaoxiao, don't worry. Acting is not just about the status of the role, but the quality of the role. Immerse yourself in An Yu's role and you will definitely gain the support of many people. When the time comes, you would have more roles to choose from," Ye Zi explained to her patiently.</p> 
 <p>"Okay, I'll listen to you," Xiaoxiao gave a perfunctory nod. She then leaned close to Ye Zi and whispered nervously, "Ye Zi, what about the thing that I asked of you previously?"</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi looked awkward and embarrassed, "Xiaoxiao, I can only help you to think of another way."</p> 
 <p>Xiaoxiao's expression immediately darkened as she looked at Ye Zi and grudgingly said, "I'm really envious of your luck. Why was I unable to meet a benefactor like Xu Jiaojiao? Sigh!"</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi was about to reply to her when the director called for her for the script reading. She took a glance at Xiaoxiao. In the end, she didn't say anything and stood up to walk towards the director.</p> 
 <p>Before she could take her third step, she heard Xiaoxiao's voice from behind her.</p> 
 <p>"Ye Zi, you didn't help me to ask, did you? You are afraid that I would snatch your resources away."</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi halted her steps for a brief moment before she continued walking without turning back.</p> 
 <p>The moment when she had sincerely requested Xu Ping to sign Xiaoxiao was still in her mind. She genuinely wanted to help Xiaoxiao, for they were friends who had gone through hardships together. Hence, she mustered the courage to ask Xu Ping to sign Xiaoxiao. And yet, this was how Xiaoxiao thought of her.</p> 
 <p>She really tried her best. Xu Ping didn't reject her from the start and said she would consider it. But not long after, Xu Ping rejected her request and said that Xiaoxiao had gone down many dark twists and turns and harbored too many thoughts. Xu Ping even advised her to stay away from Xiaoxiao. She agreed readily, but in the next moment, she helped Xiaoxiao to clinch the role of An Yu, which had a significant amount of screentime.</p> 
 <p>She was still the original Ye Zi, but Xiaoxiao was no longer the same Xiaoxiao that would bring her along wherever she went for fear that her friend, Ye Zi, would starve since she could not find a job.</p> 
 <p>But, she was also no longer the original Ye Zi. She developed her own principles. Some things only have to be done once. It was fine as long as she had a clear conscience.</p> 
 <p>Some people are held back by self-pity, while others instead put in more effort to charge towards success.</p> 
 <p>In life, everyone would have times when they feel lost, when they struggle with their difficulties. However, some people had firm determination and a clear goal. Though the road ahead might be shrouded by a layer of heavy fog and lined with rugged pebbles, these people would never go off-track.</p> 
 <p>Indeed, some people were born with good fortune and lived a smooth sailing life. These people were the lucky ones who had a background blessed by the heavens, but there were even more people who achieved success through their own efforts and hard work.</p> 
 <p>As long as one guarded their own hearts, and refused to fall into despair when they were at the very bottom, and didn’t become overconfident when they had arrived at the peak, they would reap significant rewards.</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi devoted herself to the shoot after hearing the director explain the scene. The reason she had the chance to play the female lead in a drama today was not just because she had Xu Jiaojiao as her backer. More importantly, she was willing to put in the effort, and she worked diligently. Every director or actors and actresses who acted with her had nothing but good things to say about her. That was how she earned her reputation in the industry.</p> 
 <p>Ye Zi only had one goal, and that was to be like her idol - to treat every job seriously and do her very best.</p> 
 <p>Just as everyone was trying to look for Jiaojiao's appearance in the photos of foreign countries, the Peerless Couple had already made a round trip and were back in China.</p> 
 <p>It wasn't because they already had their fill of fun. Rather, it was because they had received an invitation to an engagement party.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu was getting engaged.</p> 
 <p>Truthfully, unlike Lin Yan, Lin Yu was considered to be Sheng Jiaoyang's actual ex-boyfriend.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, Sheng Jiaoyang dated him back then mostly to spite Sheng Shiyun. Hence, she had always felt sorry towards Lin Yu. When she received his invitation to the engagement party, she didn’t hesitate and immediately pulled Shen Zhining back to China.</p> 
 <p>There were many people at the engagement party. These people were all either influential figures, or the families of influential figures.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining came hand in hand, and they were personally received by Lin Yu's parents. Though they were younger than Lin Yu's parents, they were pivotal figures in other areas, and were naturally different from the others of the same generation.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu wasn't in the banquet hall. He would probably appear later with his fiancée.</p> 
 <p>In the banquet hall, everyone was chatting and laughing heartily, and there was a harmonious atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>When everyone was almost done exchanging greetings, Lin Yu's father went on stage, "Today, we celebrate the engagement of our Lin Yu and Miss Liao from the Liao Family. We want to express our gratitude to everyone for taking the time out to join us on this wonderful occasion. Without further ado, let us welcome the main leads of the day."</p> 
 <p>The band had stopped playing while Lin Yu's father was speaking, but the music started playing again as soon as he welcomed the main leads of the party. Everyone looked towards the door as two ushers pulled the banquet doors open. Lin Yu entered arm-in-arm with a beautifully dressed young woman.</p> 
 <p>The red carpet extended from the door all the way to the stage, and it gave off the vibes of a wedding procession.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu looked quite similar to Lin Yan. Hence, Lin Yu was naturally also very handsome.The couple was dolled up nicely, and they looked like a golden couple.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang whispered to Shen Zhining, "I was initially worried that Sheng Shiyun would pester him to no ends, but now that he has found such a beautiful fiancée, I am relieved."</p> 
 <p>However, she had spoken too soon.</p> 
 <p>As Lin Yu and his fiancée stood on the stage and were exchanging their engagement rings as per the host's rundown, the doors to the banquet hall were flung open. </p> 
 <p>"Lin Yu—" A heart-wrenching scream echoed in the hall.</p>
