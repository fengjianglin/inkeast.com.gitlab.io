<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>As soon as Sheng Jiaoyang had sobered up, she found herself standing under the shower with a half-naked man standing in front of her. No one in their right mind would stay calm in this situation.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart was beating like crazy, her emotions in a complete mess. She didn’t know how to face the current situation. The only thing that reassured her was that she was still wearing her clothes. Although she was drenched and her silk pajamas were stuck to her body, it was better than not wearing anything at all.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her sober expression, Shen Zhining turned and walked out of the bathroom.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hands and covered her face. <em>OMG! Could it be that Shen Zhining was taking a shower and she broke in on her own initiative?! How else could she explain the fact that Shen Zhining was half-naked, but her clothes were untouched?</em></p> 
 <p>After dilly-dallying and drying her hair, she walked out of the bathroom. Upon seeing Shen Zhining fast asleep in bed, she heaved a sigh of relief and quietly tucked herself into her self-made floor bed.</p> 
 <p>The next day, at breakfast, Daisy’s expression looked gloomy as she informed everyone that she was leaving. The two elders also said that they were going back, expressing that they didn’t want to disturb the pair’s lovey-dovey days any longer.</p> 
 <p>Just before they boarded the plane, Grandfather Shen called Shen Zhining aside, “It doesn’t matter if Jiaojiao gets pregnant, just don’t hide it from us when the time comes. You can let your grandmother and I take care of the child while you two enjoy your own time together.”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>He hadn’t expected his grandfather to react like this.</em></p> 
 <p>In a corner, Daisy stood in front of Sheng Jiaoyang with an ugly expression and asked, “You…you touched my chest last night, didn’t you?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked innocently. “Did I?” Her eyes fell on Daisy’s plump chest and she thought: <em>Hmm…must feel good when one touches them.</em></p> 
 <p>Daisy, who retained some memories of yesterday night, wanted to bite this shameless woman in front of her to death. She murmured, “You pervert!” Then, she turned and left to board the plane.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p>Standing on one side, Felix tried his best to hold back his laughter.</p> 
 <p>Watching the plane soar into the sky, Sheng Jiaoyang touched the tips of her reddened ears. <em>Did she really touch Daisy’s chest last night?</em></p> 
 <p>“Felix, move her things out of my room!” Shen Zhining immediately instructed Felix.</p> 
 <p>“Right away, Boss!” Felix promptly asked a few people to go up and get the task done.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Shen Zhining and asked, “My mission has been accomplished, so I can leave now, right?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining cast her an indifferent look and said, “Your mission has just started. Only when I deem that your help is no longer needed can this mission be considered complete.”</p> 
 <p>“But, what if you can’t find a wife for the rest of your life…<em>cough, cough</em>…” Sheng Jiaoyang immediately halted and covered her mouth.</p> 
 <p>“You should start praying!” Shen Zhining said ambiguously. With a smirk tugging at his lips, he turned and headed back to the villa.</p> 
 <p><em>So…her mission isn’t merely pretending to be his girlfriend? She now has to find him a wife as well?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took a deep breath as she thought: <em>How would she know what kind of woman Demon King Shen likes? All this time, she hadn’t seen Shen Zhining initiate with any woman. Could it be…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Demon King Shen actually likes men?</em></p> 
 <p>As her thoughts got to this point, Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes widened in shock.</p> 
 <p>Regardless of whether Shen Zhining liked men or women, she didn’t have to worry. There were many handsome men and beautiful women in the entertainment industry, so there would certainly be one or two that suit his tastes.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s pupils were suffused with a faint glow as she pondered over this. There was no doubt; she was ready to be his matchmaker. If she could get away from Demon King Shen, then why should she bother with the others? Besides, Shen Zhining wasn’t someone with a good temperament, but he also wasn’t one who would engage in domestic violence. If one was favoured by him, although that unlucky person would have to tolerate that gloomy face every day, at least he or she wouldn’t have to worry about food and clothing…</p> 
 <p>It was at this moment that Sheng Jiaoyang strengthened her resolve to do well in the entertainment industry. She had to broaden her network and find someone for Demon King Shen to increase her chances of escape.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang stood in front of her house, she felt as if a lifetime had gone by. With all the things that had happened recently, she felt as if she’d been through an abyss of suffering with each day feeling like a year!</p> 
 <p>When she opened the door, she was shocked to hear a voice coming from inside. Last week, when she contacted Xu Qing, the latter told her that en route to her trip, she passed by a remote impoverished mountain area and saw the teacher responsible for teaching the people there having a hard time. Thus, she whimsically decided to stay there and help for a while. Since this was something Xu Qing desired to do herself, Sheng Jiaoyang greatly supported her mother’s decision. She had even transferred a sum of money to Xu Qing’s bank account at her disposal.</p> 
 <p><em>She’s back already?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Wait a second…how come there’s a man’s voice as well?</em></p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang walked into the living room, she saw Xu Qing and a man sitting on a sofa looking at a photo album. She heard Xu Qing say, “This one was taken when Jiaojiao was five years old, and this one was taken when she was in primary school. This one…”</p> 
 <p>“I’m back!” Sheng Jiaoyang abruptly announced.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing turned her head and was surprised to see Sheng Jiaoyang standing there. She hurriedly stood up and said, “Jiaojiao, you’re back?”</p> 
 <p>At this time, the man also stood up and turned around.</p> 
 <p>The man appeared quite young; she reckoned that he must be in his early thirties. He looked, in fact, even more youthful and energetic than Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>“Hello, Jiaojiao,” the man greeted Sheng Jiaoyang with his substandard Mandarin.</p> 
 <p>“Hello! You are…?” Although Sheng Jiaoyang was asking the man, she was peering at Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>“My Chinese name is Li Weiqi.”</p> 
 <p>“He’s a friend I met on the tour group.”</p> 
 <p>“She’s a friend I met on the tour group.”</p> 
 <p>The man and Xu Qing responded almost at the same time. Afterwards, the two stared at one another and smiled.</p> 
 <p>A glint flashed across Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes upon hearing their responses. <em>Looks like there’s more to this than meets the eye!</em></p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say that you wanted to stay and help out in the mountain area?” asked Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing then explained, “That was my initial plan, but Weiqi said that my strength alone wouldn’t be of much help. He told me that he can set up an educational fund program and gather funding from other rich people, making education available for those poor children in the mountain area.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stole a glance at Li Weiqi. <em>He sure had many ideas. However, if she were to say that this guy wasn’t interested in Xu Qing, then her surname wouldn’t be Sheng. Okay fine, her last name was Xu now, not Sheng…but this wasn’t the main point.</em></p> 
 <p>“That’s a good idea!” She went over and sat down on the sofa on the opposite side. Afterwards, she shared her thoughts and experiences on setting up a public welfare funds program.</p> 
 <p>The more Li Weiqi listened, the more surprised he felt. He stared at Sheng Jiaoyang in astonishment. <em>Qing’s daughter sure was intelligent! To think that she had such a deep understanding and so much insight in setting up a funds program. She looked like a pompous little princess on the surface, but was, in fact, a very profound person on the inside. One truly couldn’t judge a book by its cover!</em></p> 
 <p>Although Xu Qing didn't understand much of their conversation, she still sat there with a smile on her face as she listened to them speak. When they finished, she asked, “Jiaojiao, weren’t you supposed to be at school, joining military training classes?”</p> 
 <p>“Oh.” Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes swivelled as she pondered for a while, but she decided to tell Xu Qing the truth in the end. “I’m going abroad to attend the runway at Fashion Week in two days, so I’ve asked for leave from school.”</p> 
 <p>“The runway? Jiaojiao, you’re a model?” Li Weiqi was even more astounded now.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao is amazing! She took part in a supermodel competition not long ago and won the championship!” Xu Qing proudly beamed.</p> 
 <p>Li Weiqi nodded and said no more. This little girl’s knowledge and experience was an eye-opener for him. He also knew that Xu Jiaojiao was underaged and that she would only turn eighteen this year.</p> 
 <p>“Would you like to go abroad with me for a few days?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>“I…” Xu Qing turned and glanced at Li Weiqi.</p> 
 <p>Li Weiqi smiled. “You should go and have fun with Jiaojiao. I’ll go back and get things ready for the funds program.”</p> 
 <p>After Li Weiqi had left, Sheng Jiaoyang asked Xu Qing, “You intend to find me a stepfather?”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing choked on her saliva and blushed as she said, “That’s impossible…Weiqi is just a friend. He’s still so young, and there’ll be many young girls for him to choose from.”</p> 
 <p>“Your way of thinking is outdated. Nowadays, there are a lot of older women dating younger men, so this kind of relationship is common these days. Even an age gap of ten years or more is possible. He’s thirty-three this year and you’re only forty. There’s only seven years between you two, so why not?”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t be ridiculous, we’re just friends. He…he doesn’t like me…”</p> 
 <p>“How can you be so certain that he doesn’t like you?” Sheng Jiaoyang interrupted.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing was stunned for a few seconds. She soon recovered and stammered, “I-I’m already so old! H-how could he possibly like me? That’s out of the question.”</p> 
 <p><em>After all was said and done, it was still because of her lack of self-confidence!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang silently stared at Xu Qing for a moment, thinking that she had to find Mei Niu and let her stylist transform her Mother’s appearance. Most of the time, people’s self-confidence came from their outer appearance. So, the first step was to transform her Mother’s appearance and let her slowly built up her confidence.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was a woman of action. She quickly booked their tickets and immediately took off with Xu Qing.</p>
