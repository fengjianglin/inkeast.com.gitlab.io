 <p>“This is their personal issue. Don't interfere in it.” Right as Lina was about to alight the car, Sven pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>Lina shot a glance at Sven and returned to observe the situation. She was feeling quite anxious, as she knew that people who did not know about Jiaojiao’s situation would definitely misunderstand what was happening, especially with Lin Yan standing by her side and leading her on.</p> 
 <p>As she was still deliberating whether to shout through the car window to inform Shen Zhining about Jiaojiao’s situation, she was suddenly left dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>Something shocking had happened at the place where the confrontation was ongoing.</p> 
 <p>In a sudden move, Shen Zhining swiftly carried Sheng Jiaoyang and walked away. Even Lin Yan took a while to recover before giving chase, but Shen Zhining reacted quickly and stopped him from getting close.</p> 
 <p>Lina let out a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>“What a man! Tsk tsk. If your brother had half of his determination, he would have embraced his beau long ago,” Sven exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Shen is indeed strong-willed, but he isn’t underhanded.” She put emphasis on the word ‘underhanded’, and even shot Sven a glare when she said it.</p> 
 <p>Sven squinted his eyes and moved his hand so close to Lina’s face that they were almost touching. “You’re saying that I’m underhanded?”</p> 
 <p>Lina did not flinch, “You said so yourself.”</p> 
 <p>“I don't mind you saying that,” Sven laughed viciously, “At most, I’ll just have to show how underhanded I am to you. Otherwise, your words would just become empty, no?”</p> 
 <p>Lina froze.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang, who was now utterly dumbstruck, finally recovered, she found herself stuffed into another vehicle.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing? Trying to kidnap me?” Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to get out of the car from the other side, but was held back by his tight embrace.</p> 
 <p>“Go!”</p> 
 <p>As per his command, the driver stepped on the accelerator.</p> 
 <p>“Let me go, I want to get off!” Sheng Jiaoyang struggled.</p> 
 <p>The strength of a male and female were naturally unequal, so no matter how hard she struggled, he did not budge at all.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, I will never let you get off,” he said while gnashing on his teeth.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang struggled for a while more, and she only came to a stop after realizing how futile her actions were. However, just because she had stopped struggling, it did not mean that she was not angry. How could she not be angry, when she was suddenly carried away by someone who had bullied her since she was young?</p> 
 <p>When a person was angry, logic would give way to emotions, and their thoughts would become particularly extreme.</p> 
 <p>Currently, Sheng Jiaoyang was thinking how hard it must have been for her past self, to be in a relationship with Demon King Shen. <em>What happened in these two years that made me go out with Demon King Shen? Wasn’t everything going pretty well?</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining remained silent during the entire ride, and his face remained a blank slate too. Only his arms, which were tightly embracing Sheng Jiaoyang, revealed how he was feeling.</p> 
 <p>As the vehicle got further away from Sven’s private manor, and the tension in the vehicle got heavier, Sheng Jiaoyang’s anger had subsided, and her logic finally returned.</p> 
 <p>She still couldn’t remember anything after the point when she had returned to her home country in disappointment after she found out that Lin Yan did not reciprocate her feelings. She was about to look for Liang Xiaohui and Sheng Shiyun to settle their scores when the car accident happened.</p> 
 <p>In her memory, although she had returned home feeling very disappointed, she still liked Lin Yan, and she had hoped that Lin Yan would come looking for her.</p> 
 <p>Thus, when she woke up and heard Lin Yan’s confession, she accepted it without objection.</p> 
 <p>However, now that Shen Zhining suddenly appeared, and even forcefully took her away, Sheng Jiaoyang found that, apart from her initial anger at being kidnapped, she did not feel disgusted by his actions at all, even though they were in such close proximity when he embraced her. She did not feel unaccustomed to it. Rather, she even felt that her body was used to him.</p> 
 <p>To Sheng Jiaoyang, who still had the image of Demon King Shen in her mind, this was highly abnormal.</p> 
 <p>However, there was no time for her to delve deeper into her thoughts, as the vehicle has already come to a stop.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining let go of her and got out of the car. Then, he went to the other side and opened the door for Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang remained seated in the car.</p> 
 <p>She was contemplating whether to take this opportunity to escape.</p> 
 <p>But considering the disparity in strength between them, she would be caught again not long after her escape. Thus, she gave up on that thought.</p> 
 <p>As she was still weighing her chances, Shen Zhining seemed to be getting impatient. Hence, he reached in and picked her up.</p> 
 <p>She subconsciously hooked her arms around his neck, and her body stuck tightly to his.</p> 
 <p>“Let me down, I’ll walk on my own.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining did not listen to her, and he continued walking instead.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked around, and realized that they were in a basement car park, and that Shen Zhining was headed towards an elevator.</p> 
 <p>After they boarded the elevator, the elevator ascended, only to stop on the first floor. The door opened to a young couple, who was just about to enter the elevator, until they noticed the people standing inside.</p> 
 <p>How would the young couple dare to step into the lift when there were two imposing bodyguards present? They hurriedly signalled that they would enter the next elevator, when they noticed the two people standing behind the bodyguards.</p> 
 <p>“Wow, she must be a very lucky girl! To think that she has a man who is willing to carry her like that…”</p> 
 <p>After a short while, the elevator door was shut, and the young couple’s excited comments could no longer be heard.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang covered her eyes in embarrassment. Initially, she wanted to cover her face, but her hand could not cover her entire face. So, she opted to cover her eyes and half her face instead.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining lowered his head to look at her. However, his eyes suddenly stopped at the middle finger of her right hand, as he noticed that the ring that should be there was now missing.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding!</em> The elevator door opened.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining walked out with huge strides.</p> 
 <p>“You can put me down now,” Sheng Jiaoyang said in a hurry when she saw that they were going to enter a room that looked similar to that of a presidential suite. The bodyguards stopped outside the door.</p> 
 <p>However, Shen Zhining did not stop.</p> 
 <p>When she saw that they were headed towards the bedroom, Sheng Jiaoyang panicked and struggled in his arms. She didn’t even care that she might fall and hurt herself.</p> 
 <p>Afraid that she might fall down, Shen Zhining finally put her down.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stepped back when she touched the ground, but in just a couple of steps, she was cornered against the wall by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>“What… what are you trying to do?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining held up her right hand, and bent down to look her right in her eye.</p> 
 <p>“You even threw the ring away. It seems that you’re truly determined to abandon me.”</p> 
 <p><em>Ring?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang was stumped. She looked at her own hand, then her gaze shifted to the ring on the middle finger of his left hand, before subconsciously darting back to look at her own empty finger.</p> 
 <p>“I…” She wanted to say that she did not remember having any ring, but her lips were sealed shut by his sudden kiss that seemed to be venting his anger.</p> 
 <p>“Mmpf!”</p> 
 <p>She tried to push him away, only for her hand to be pinned against the wall.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was both surprised and flustered.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang could not resist his eager and fierce kiss, as he pressed himself hard on her. She could only try to endure.</p> 
 <p>After a long while, Shen Zhining finally let go of the soft lips that were starting to swell from his kiss. He looked into her eyes, and slowly emphasized every word clearly, “Don’t ever think of leaving me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shoved his hand aside. <em>Smack!</em></p> 
 <p>A red patch appeared on Shen Zhining’s white and delicate face. Clearly, she had applied a lot of force behind her blow.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang became flustered when she saw the red mark appear on his face. “I… I hate it when people force me to do things,” she stammered.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining just looked at her, and the look in his eyes was undecipherable.</p> 
 <p>Just then, a faint commotion could be heard outside the room.</p>
