 <p>Changing out of their outfits, Sheng Jiaoyang and Lina walked to the front of the runway together. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining was talking with the brand director.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stretched out his open palm to Sheng Jiaoyang when he saw them coming out.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang naturally placed her hand on his. Lina smiled to herself when she saw their actions.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, Mr Miller would like to invite us for lunch," said Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Lina instead as she had previously agreed to have lunch with the latter.</p> 
 <p>"That’s fine, my darling wishes to spend some time with me alone. You guys go ahead, we can arrange to have lunch another day," Lina said to Sheng Jiaoyang before she bade Mr Miller farewell and left with light steps.</p> 
 <p>Director Miller brought along his assistant, and together with Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining, they headed towards a nearby Michelin restaurant.</p> 
 <p>After placing their orders, Miller brought up the topic of wanting Sheng Jiaoyang to be the brand's ambassador.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang readily agreed. No one would reject money from legal channels. If she could earn her keep, she would. Being a parasite was not the lifestyle she sought; otherwise, why would she continue to shoot drama and walk fashion shows?</p> 
 <p>After lunch, Director Miller then invited them to participate in a fashion gala in the evening before they parted their ways.</p> 
 <p>On this sunny April afternoon, Paris was bathed in the warm sunlight accompanied by a slight breeze. The people on the streets seemed much more carefree and self-satisfied.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn't bring an evening gown. She had to buy a new gown to attend the evening gala. As she was attending the gala hosted by Director Miller's brand, coupled with the fact that she was to become their ambassador, she would naturally have to be donned in the brand's gown.</p> 
 <p>"I have never shopped with you before," Sheng Jiaoyang clung onto Shen Zhining's arm and casually strolled towards the mall.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned and looked at her, "We have all the time in the future."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled.</p> 
 <p>When she was in China previously, she was restricted from going out due to her increasing popularity. Wherever she went, she would surely be surrounded if she wasn’t in disguise. But she didn't have such concerns overseas, which was also the reason why celebrities loved to go overseas for travel or even migrate there.</p> 
 <p>"How does this look?" Sheng Jiaoyang came out of the changing room in a black evening gown and turned from side to side in front of Shen Zhining who was seated on the sofa.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, his gaze attracted to her exposed sleek back when she turned sideways but she promptly turned back again. Without any change in his expression, he shook his head slightly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow. Since her partner said this dress wouldn't do, then she would definitely have to change to another piece. She trusted Shen Zhining's taste pretty much.</p> 
 <p>She turned and walked into the changing room.</p> 
 <p>The gaze from behind her grew intense as it was fixated on her beautiful back which didn't have an ounce of flab. From her sphenoid and heading south… No more, she had entered the changing room.</p> 
 <p>Such a sight should only be left for his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang came out after changing into the second outfit. It was a floral tube fairy gown. Chiffon layered the gown from the waist down forming the hem of the dress.</p> 
 <p>She looked like a fairy but he immediately shook his head.</p> 
 <p>The shop assistant, who was standing by the side and helping to pass Xu Jiaojiao her outfits, was just going to open her mouth to sing compliments but saw the latter's boyfriend shaking his head. She could only mutter under her breath that Xu Jiaojiao's boyfriend had no taste for Xu Jiaojiao looked exceptionally gorgeous in both gowns. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang picked up the hem and turned one round before she approached Shen Zhining and asked, "Isn't this nice?" She felt that the gown was beautiful.</p> 
 <p>Their eyes were on the same level. Shen Zhining's gaze caught hold of the budding sight from below her collarbones and he narrowed his eyes. </p> 
 <p>"Zhining?" Sheng Jiaoyang cocked her head to one side and called out softly when he didn't respond.</p> 
 <p>"You haven't worn it properly," Shen Zhining's voice croaked, sounding a little dehydrated and dry from his usual tone.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn't doubt his words and turned towards the shop assistant, "Come along and readjust the gown for me."</p> 
 <p>"I'll help you." Shen Zhining stood up suddenly, grabbed her hand and headed towards the changing room.</p> 
 <p><em>What?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang didn't even have the opportunity to refuse before he pulled her into the changing room.</p> 
 <p>As soon as the door was closed, she was pressed against the wall of the changing room and his lips fell onto hers.</p> 
 <p><em>Wh-what?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang had no time to think how she had induced the Demon King's desire as she was engulfed in his fiery passion. It felt as though a century had passed but at the same time, it felt like an instant. Their lips parted, and Sheng Jiaoyang could finally reclaim her thoughts.</p> 
 <p>"You are doing this on purpose!" Sheng Jiaoyang complained.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining moved his hand that was caressing her cheek, his thumb sliding across the corners of her lips suggestively. With an eyebrow raised and an unruly tone, he replied, "Right, I did do it on purpose."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang parted her lips but was suddenly at a loss for words. Shen Zhining was currently invincible; she could never catch up with how shameless he was. </p> 
 <p>"You still owe me a kiss," Shen Zhining said.</p> 
 <p>"When?"</p> 
 <p>"Trying to deny it? Hmm?" He grunted threateningly.</p> 
 <p>"My memory has turned worse recently. Zhining, can't you kindly remind me?" Sheng Jiaoyang blinked her eyes coquettishly and raised her index finger, shaking it.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining couldn't resist it and stretched out his hand to pinch her cheeks.</p> 
 <p>"Why are you always unable to remember important things like this?"</p> 
 <p><em>Are these things important? Are, they???</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was extremely speechless. <em>If a kiss is important, then everything else in this world can also be considered as 'something' important.</em></p> 
 <p>"Next time, if you forget again, you would have to pay it back in double." Shen Zhining loved the touch of her skin and caressed her cheek again.</p> 
 <p>"Knock, knock, knock." There was a knock on the door followed by the voice of the shop assistant. "Excuse me, do the clothes fit?"</p> 
 <p>"No." Shen Zhining answered.</p> 
 <p>"Why? I think it looks good." Sheng Jiaoyang stared at him with suspicions and melancholy.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining's hand on her cheek slid down from her face, along her neckline, past her collarbones and tapped on her slightly bulging bosom with a force that was light but wouldn't go ignored.</p> 
 <p>"…" Sheng Jiaoyang's expression froze. Her frozen expression was particularly interesting and his finger hence slid over her exposed bosom.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang parted her lips, "Zhining, you have turned bad…"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining used his other hand to cup her chin and bit down lightly on her lips. In a low voice, he said, "I can turn worse."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang immediately lifted a hand to grab his demonic claw and blurted, "I have to hurry and change. I've still got to buy shoes later and get my makeup done. We can't delay any further or we wouldn't make it in time for the evening gala."</p> 
 <p><em>I shall let you off for now.</em> The corners of Shen Zhining's lips raised into a smile as he stood up and left the changing room.</p> 
 <p>"Bring the outfit in." He looked at the shop assistant who was holding another outfit.</p> 
 <p>The shop assistant entered the changing room in a hurry. Seeing the swollen lips and alluring eyes of her female customer, the shop assistant immediately looked at the latter's clothes and heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that the clothes weren't messed up. Looking at the way the couple were just now, the shop assistant was really afraid that both of them would do indescribable things in the changing room.</p> 
 <p>The carefully chosen third outfit was a matching black and white suit with a vertical collar. The top piece was a sleeveless crop top and was paired with long pants. The lower half of the pants were pleated black and white.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining's gaze lingered on her slim waist before he finally nodded his head. Sheng Jiaoyang finally understood; he didn't want her to expose too much flesh.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang returned to the changing room to change into her original clothes, Shen Zhining took out his card and passed it to the shop assistant. "Pack the previous two outfits too."</p> 
 <p>The shop assistant's eyes brightened up instantly and gave him an affirmative answer accompanied by an exceptionally sweet smile.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang came out of the dressing room, she thought it was weird to see the shop assistant passing three bags of clothes to Shen Zhining. "I thought there was only one outfit? There aren't any clothes for male here, what else did he buy?"</p> 
 <p>"Your husband bought the previous two outfits that you tried on as well," said the shop assistant.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow and looked at Shen Zhining. She thought it was even more strange. "I thought you didn't like those two outfits?"</p> 
 <p>"I didn't say I don't like it," Shen Zhining retorted.</p> 
 <p>"But you shook your head."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining smiled, "I just didn't want you to wear those to the gala."</p> 
 <p>"Then why did you buy them?" <em>You shouldn't spend money like that even if you are rich.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang nagged in her heart.</p> 
 <p>If it was in the past, she wouldn't feel anything as the previous Sheng Jiaoyang didn't have a firm concept about money. Back then, it was only a matter of wanting something or not wanting something. But after experiencing hardship as Xu Jiaojiao where she only had a few pennies on her, Sheng Jiaoyang realised how extravagant she had lived as her former self. Her views towards life had gone through many changes.</p> 
 <p>"Only wear them for my eyes," said Shen Zhining as though it was a given.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was totally stunned by his words.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stretched out his arm and hooked it around Sheng Jiaoyang's waist and walked out of the shop.</p> 
 <p>After purchasing her shoes, doing her makeup and changing into her evening outfit, Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining then headed towards the hotel where the gala would be held.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining didn't have to buy any clothes for his formal suits were already tailor-made. That was why it was so convenient for men. As long as they wore a suit to a formal event, nothing would go wrong.</p> 
 <p>A red carpet was laid on the ground that led to the entrance of the gala. There was also a background wall filled with the brand's logo. In front of the background wall, there were some media photographers who were taking photos of those who passed by.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang arrived, there happened to be a Chinese starlet who was posing at the background wall in front of her.</p> 
 <p>The foreign media photographers swiftly turned their lens onto the couple that entered hand in hand. A photographer who attended the fashion show in the morning recognized Sheng Jiaoyang as she had left a deep impression earlier. The photographer exclaimed, "It's her," causing the other photographers to assume that a bigshot had arrived and proceeded to take photos of Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>The Chinese starlet, who was standing before the background wall and was preparing to strike another pose, was instantly embarrassed and turned to look.</p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at the starlet, "You are?"</p> 
 <p>"…" <em>She actually doesn't recognise me!!</em> The Chinese starlet was mad. She considered herself famous in China, or at least more famous than the person before her. Moreover, the Chinese starlet had become famous for quite some time but Sheng Jiaoyang didn't recognise her. <em>She must be doing this on purpose!</em></p> 
 <p>"Look here please," a photographer voiced out.</p> 
 <p>A few people looked towards the photographers at the same time. The next moment, the Chinese starlet could feel the corners of her eyes twitching. <em>These photographers were all taking photos of Xu Jiaojiao. Even the photographer whom she had hired also had his lens aimed at the currently notorious Xu Jiaojiao!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang ignored the Chinese starlet and turned to face the photographers. She casually struck a few fairly exaggerated poses and didn't linger around for long before she hooked her arm over Shen Zhining's and the pair entered the banquet hall.</p> 
 <p>The Chinese starlet felt that she had been severely humiliated when she saw them walking past her without greeting her.</p> 
 <p><em>Xu Jiaojiao, how dare you pretend as if you don't know me?!</em></p>
