 <p>Still half asleep, Liu Lu performed her usual morning routine of checking her phone as soon as she woke up. However, what she saw next jolted her awake and forced her eyes wide open. </p> 
 <p>“Yuanyuan! Yuanyuan!!” Brimming with excitement, she called out to Zheng Yuan, who was sleeping right beside her. </p> 
 <p>“Liu Lu, what do you want? Can’t you let us sleep peacefully in the morning!” Her other two roommates responded unhappily. </p> 
 <p>No matter how much of a deep sleeper Zheng Yuan was, Liu Lu’s loud shouts had woken her up. She opened her eyes hazily, and a hint of drowsiness could be heard in her voice when she said, “What happened?” </p> 
 <p>“Er Jiao’s made the headlines!”</p> 
 <p>“Meh. Is making the headlines an uncommon thing for her? Liu Lu, in the future, would you not make a big fuss out of everything? I know that you’re a fan of Xu Jiaojiao, but you really don’t have to act like you’ve discovered a new world whenever you see some news about her,” her roommate, who was lying on the bed opposite her, started grumbling. </p> 
 <p>Liu Lu ignored her babbling roommate and urged Zheng Yuan to look at her phone, “Yuanyuan, look! The media uncovered Er Jiao’s new identity, and it is absolutely unbelievable!” </p> 
 <p>“Liu Lu, you’re hopeless!” Her other roommate rolled her eyes and pulled her bed covers over her face as she drifted back off to sleep. </p> 
 <p>“In the past, many fans were worried that our Er Jiao would be forced by her company to take on some lousy or substandard jobs. Haha, who would dare to do this to her now that they know about her new position?” Liu Lu stated with pride. </p> 
 <p>Zheng Yuan grabbed her glasses and put them on. Then, she began surfing the web, and the first thing she saw was the news about Jiaojiao. </p> 
 <p>When she read the headline: <em>Xu Jiaojiao is the chairman of Entertainment International</em>, she was stunned. It was only after some time that her brain managed to process the meaning behind those words, and she found herself utterly wide awake. </p> 
 <p>Zheng Yuan sat up and rubbed her eyes, “April Fools is still a few months down the road, right?” </p> 
 <p>“The news is real. You also find it hard to believe, right? When I first read the article, I thought it was a joke too. How can such explosive news suddenly appear randomly overnight? I feel like I’ve missed out on so much. If I had known earlier that such interesting news would be released last night, I wouldn’t have gone out for dinner and karaoke,” Liu Lu explained. </p> 
 <p>Zheng Yuan scrolled through the articles and took in all the information. </p> 
 <p>“No wonder Er Jiao kept on avoiding the idea of starting her own studio. Haha! Er Jiao is the chairman of Entertainment International. The entire company is hers, so why would she need to start another studio?” Liu Lu could not stop herself from prattling on and on. </p> 
 <p>“What?” Her other roommates could not believe what Liu Lu just said. </p> 
 <p>“How is that possible?” </p> 
 <p>With pride brimming in her chest, Liu Lu spoke out, “How is that not possible? Anything can happen when it comes to our Er Jiao. You guys didn’t believe that she was best friends with Princess Wight either, but what happened in the end? But ultimately, you were slapped by the truth.” </p> 
 <p>Those two immediately reached for their phones. As the saying goes, ‘Don’t believe what people tell you until you see it for yourself’, and seeing is believing. They had to see it for themselves. </p> 
 <p>“Wow, can you believe that Mr. Shen would just give Xu Jiaojiao his share of such a huge corporation? My gosh, how could Xu Jiaojiao be so lucky? She just inherited a huge sum of money, and now she got such an expensive gift from her boyfriend. Ugh, she must have saved the entire Milky Way in her past life. Otherwise, why would every wonderful thing happen to her?” </p> 
 <p>“Even if they break up in the future, Xu Jiaojiao wouldn’t have lost out. Think about how much money that 51% of Entertainment International’s shares are worth!” </p> 
 <p>“Hey! What do you mean by break up?! Don’t curse our Er Jiao. Even if all the couples in the world break up, those two won’t!” Liu Lu rolled her eyes. </p> 
 <p>“Okay, okay. They won’t break up.” </p> 
 <p>“If he’s willing to give her such a huge present, then his mind must be set on making Xu Jiaojiao his future wife. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so generous. I’m looking forward to their marriage. It will definitely be a magnificent and grand wedding that we will never ever experience again in our lifetimes.” </p> 
 <p>When she heard her roommate speak about how much she looked forward to their wedding, a bright smile appeared on Liu Lu’s face. “I’m looking forward to it too. I hope that they’ll get married as soon as possible. Haha, I’m already starting to anticipate their little baby. After they have a baby, the family of three can appear on family shows. That would be so much fun.” </p> 
 <p>“Mr. Shen posted something on Weibo,” Zheng Yuan suddenly spoke up. </p> 
 <p>Liu Lu rushed over to look at the screen. A short while later, she let out a startled cry, “The shares that Er Jiao owned were actually bought out by her?” </p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang had just woken up, and she was looking through her phone when she saw the news article claiming that Shen Zhining had given her his shares of Entertainment International. She instantly glanced at the person cuddled up behind her. </p> 
 <p>“See, I knew that they would all think that Entertainment international was your gift to me.” </p> 
 <p>“Who cares?” Shen Zhining buried himself in her hair, taking in the scent of her body. </p> 
 <p>“If I had known that this would happen, I wouldn’t have paid you any money. Might as well just let it turn out the way everyone had anticipated it. ” </p> 
 <p>“Then I’ll give your money back.” </p> 
 <p>“No. I don’t want to feel like I’m just being supported and fed by you,” Sheng Jiaoyang mumbled. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining chuckled softly. There was a hint of laziness in his soothing voice.</p> 
 <p>He stretched his arm out to reach for his phone. And while holding her in his embrace, he updated his Weibo right before her eyes. </p> 
 <p><em>Let me clarify something, the shares of Entertainment International that Jiaojiao owns had been purchased by her. Please do not spread wrong rumours, like the rumour that Entertainment International is my betrothal gift. My betrothal gift would never be as cheap as this.</em></p> 
 <p>“Pfft!” Sheng Jiaoyang giggled when she read the last sentence. </p> 
 <p>Once Shen Zhining had updated his Weibo with the post, she turned around to face him and asked him curiously, “So… what is your betrothal gift then?” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her with a hint of tenderness in his eyes. He rested his chin on her forehead and spoke softly, “Everything I have, including me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes were practically smiling. Yet, the words that came out of her mouth were words that questioned Shen Zhining, “Are you sure? If I decide to leave you one day, then won’t you be left with nothing?” </p> 
 <p>“If you don’t want to be with me, then who will you be with? Huh?” A threatening glare appeared involuntarily in his eyes. Yet, the thing that was more threatening than both his words and his glare were his restless hands. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang immediately grabbed onto his wrists and quickly said, “I’m just joking. I’m ready to spend the rest of my life with you. I will keep my promises. I’m just worried that when I become an ugly old woman, you’ll lose interest in me and abandon me.” </p> 
 <p>“When you become an old lady, I’ll already be a rotten old man. Who’s going to hate who?” </p> 
 <p>“Your words really sounded like the lyrics of some song.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining gave her a kiss. “Even if you become an old lady, you’ll still be the most beautiful old lady in my eyes.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but reveal a smile. “Once you grow old, you’ll be the most handsome old man in my eyes.” </p> 
 <p>She suddenly began laughing. </p> 
 <p>“I can’t imagine what will happen when we turn old. We must be pretty boring to talk about something so distant.” </p> 
 <p>The two of them cuddled for a while longer before getting out of bed. </p> 
 <p>Recently, they installed a door between the yards of the two mansions. Hence, there was no longer a need for them to make a detour through the front doors. Now, they can enter each other’s mansion from the side door in their yards. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang returned back to her own house to eat breakfast. Grandfather Yang was there, and it was obvious that she would be eating with him. </p> 
 <p>“Where’s Lina? Is she still in bed?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked when she noticed that Lina wasn’t at the table. </p> 
 <p>“She didn’t come back last night,” Grandfather Yang replied. </p> 
 <p>“What?” </p> 
 <p>She immediately grabbed her phone and dialled Lina’s number. The phone rang for a few seconds before the call connected. </p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu, where are you?” </p> 
 <p>“She’s in the bathroom, you can call again later.” The deep voice of a man could be heard on the other end of the call.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was confused: “…Sven?” </p> 
 <p>The line had already been cut. </p> 
 <p><em>Why would Sven be with Lina?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang instantly rose to her feet, but she felt a brief dizzy spell from standing up too quickly. Thankfully, Shen Zhining was right beside her and was able to hold onto her. </p> 
 <p>“What happened? Is something wrong?” Grandfather Yang wrinkled his brows in worry after noticing how hasty she was. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took in a deep breath and squeezed out a smile, “Nothing’s wrong. She’s at a friend’s house.” </p> 
 <p>While eating breakfast, she glanced at her phone from time to time, but she never received a call back from Lina. </p> 
 <p>After eating breakfast, Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining headed out together. </p> 
 <p>“Zhining, I want to talk with you privately.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining reached out and wrapped her up tightly in her coat, “Sure. Let’s talk in the car.” </p> 
 <p>After heading in the car and turning on the heater, he sent Man Jun out of the vehicle. </p> 
 <p>“You want to talk to me about Lina?” Shen Zhining asked. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded. Her complexion wasn’t the greatest, and she had quite a grave expression. </p> 
 <p>“Zhining, can you help me get rid of Sven?” Sheng Jiaoyang noticed the ambiguous meanings behind her words and added, “I don’t want to take his life, I just want to stop him from getting involved with Mei Niu.” </p> 
 <p>With a face full of worry, she continued, “I’m afraid if this goes on for any longer, things will eventually come to light. Mei Niu and George have experienced a lot before they got together, and it certainly wasn’t easy for them. If any more misunderstandings occur because of this, I’m afraid that Mei Niu won’t be able to cope with it anymore.” </p> 
 <p>No matter how strong Lina appears to be, she knew better than anyone that Lina was just a foolish woman. </p> 
 <p>Others would sacrifice their friends for themselves, yet that silly girl would bring herself into a difficult situation in order to avoid trouble for her friends. </p> 
 <p>“Do you know Sven’s background?” Shen Zhining looked at her. </p> 
 <p>When Shen Zhining didn’t immediately promise to help her, but instead asked her about whether she knew Sven’s background, Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart sank. She knew all along that Sven wasn’t a simple person. Of course, if Sven was somebody easy to deal with, then Shen Zhining would have gotten rid of him long ago. He wouldn’t even need her to beg him. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining didn’t wait for her to answer, “Sven’s part of the Gudilesi Family, and the current head of the family wants him to succeed him as the next head.” </p> 
 <p><em>Gudilesi?</em> </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang found this name slightly familiar. Then, she remembered that Lin Yan’s fiancée, Julia, was also part of the Gudilesi Family. They were one of the oldest and most powerful families in Italy. </p> 
 <p>Just thinking about the consequences of going against Sven made Sheng Jiaoyang suck in a deep breath. </p> 
 <p>“Let’s just forget about it then,” Sheng Jiaoyang answered with disappointment. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wrapped his hands around hers and said, I didn’t make a move because I’m afraid that by acting, it will make the situation even worse. For someone like Sven, the more challenging a situation is, the more determined he is to get what he wants. If we try to stop him, he’ll become less willing to let Lina go.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang signed unhappily. <em>How unfortunate of her Mei Niu, to come across this nauseating person!</em></p>
