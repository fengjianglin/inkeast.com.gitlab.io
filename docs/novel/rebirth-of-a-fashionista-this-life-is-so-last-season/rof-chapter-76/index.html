<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Dad, are you worried about something?” </p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue pulled her father’s arm, cocking her head at his expression. </p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui smiled and reached out to bop Pan Mingyue’s nose. “Dad was just thinking about what to get for my baby’s next start-of-school present.” </p> 
 <p>“I want a car!” </p> 
 <p>“Alright, if my darling wants a car, we’ll get you a car. When we return, Dad will also hire a driver for you.” </p> 
 <p>“I want to drive myself.” </p> 
 <p>“Then, that’ll have to wait until you’re old enough.” </p> 
 <p>Jiang Yin walked behind them, smiling as she watched the laughing father-daughter pair. Their family had always been blessed, and she’d never regretted putting aside her pride to chase after this man. Ultimately, it was worth it. Pan Zihui was a good husband, and an even better father. Therefore, there was no way she would allow anybody to ruin their happiness!</p> 
 <p>“Huh? Isn’t that Lina?” </p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue was pleasantly surprised. “Wow, we’ve met her again. We really do have fate together. Dad, let’s go greet her!” </p> 
 <p>Without waiting for an answer, Pan Mingyue pulled her father along and strode towards Lina.</p> 
 <p>“Lina, Lina!” </p> 
 <p>Lina, who’d just been talking with Sheng Jiaoyang, heard the shout and just glanced over for a second before turning her head back to Sheng Jiaoyang. “Your cheap father’s whole family is here.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked over and sure enough, it was the whole family, with even his wife. </p> 
 <p>“We really have fate together! Lina, do you still remember me?” Pan Mingyue said to Lina excitedly. </p> 
 <p>“Where are you going today?” Pan Zihui actually looked at Sheng Jiaoyang as he asked. He’d originally wanted to make her identity clear today and didn’t expect for even the Heavens to be on their side, allowing them to run into each other like this. </p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue glanced at Pan Zihui, whose tone was especially intimate before turning to agree. “Yeah, yeah, where are you planning to go?” </p> 
 <p>“Work matters, so it’s not convenient to say,” Lina said. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was currently sizing up the woman behind the father-daughter pair. The woman had taken very good care of herself. She was definitely around the same age as Mother Xu, but she seemed much younger and her clothes were tastefully chosen. With a glance, it was easy to see that she was a Miss of a rich family. Why was a Madam involved with such a scummy man? </p> 
 <p>While Sheng Jiaoyang was inspecting her, she was also inspecting Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>In Jiang Yin’s eyes, this short haired girl seemed to have an even more elegant air than her own carefully raised daughter. She was just like a tumor, and one that unfortunately couldn’t be cut out yet. </p> 
 <p>How could that poor, shabby woman, who’d spent her entire life living amongst the plebians, possibly have such an outstanding daughter? </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, can I talk to you alone for a bit?” Pan Zihui suddenly humbled his attitude and asked. </p> 
 <p>“Dad?” Pan Mingyue had a weird look on her face as she watched her father acting strangely. </p> 
 <p>Behind them, Jiang Yin’s expression immediately changed. With how close she was with Pan Zihui, how could she not know what he was planning to do? If he told the truth, then wouldn’t the person she hated most end up joining their family of three?</p> 
 <p>“Zihui, let’s not disturb them. If you need to say something, it can be said later. It’s not like you’ll never see each other again anyways.” Jiang Yin feigned calmness. </p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui turned to look at Jiang Yin with a slight frown. He could, but he didn’t want to wait. Ever since he’d found out that Xu Qing had never remarried and that Xu Jiaojiao was actually his daughter, he’d never felt at ease.</p> 
 <p>All the small details he’d neglected before suddenly came to his mind. He remembered how before he and Jiang Yin had gotten married, Xu Qing had come to find him. She seemed to have something she wanted to say, but ultimately, she couldn’t say it. Now, he knew that Xu Qing must’ve been trying to say that she was pregnant. </p> 
 <p>Xu Qing really was a foolish woman. If she’d an abortion, she definitely could’ve gotten a different ending. But, she’d stubbornly had the child and even brought her up completely alone. Her devotion moved him. </p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, but we’re about to board a plane.” Sheng Jiaoyang also knew what Pan Zihui wanted to do, but she didn’t want that. He hadn’t cared for 18 years. It was too late to patch their relationship now!</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao…” </p> 
 <p>“Excuse me.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Lina, along with their assistant, left. </p> 
 <p>“He wanted to recognise you as his daughter,” Lina said to Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>“But, I don’t want to recognise him as my father.” </p> 
 <p>“Have you ever thought of getting back the things Xu Jiaojiao deserved on her behalf?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to glance at Lina. “That’s not necessary.”</p> 
 <p>Lina smiled slightly. “True, it’s not necessary to get too involved with them.”</p> 
 <p>They boarded the plane and were searching for their seats when Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly heard a cry. “It’s you?” </p> 
 <p>She turned her head and was surprised to see the person sitting next to her. It was Lin Yu.</p> 
 <p>Lina was walking behind her and was stunned for a few moments before immediately turning to Sheng Jiaoyang and blurting out, “Who’s he?” </p> 
 <p>Lin Yu was startled for a moment and felt that her face seemed a bit similar to his. </p> 
 <p>“He was my, cough, Jiaoyang’s ex-boyfriend.” Sheng Jiaoyang had almost blurted out the truth. </p> 
 <p>“Not ex-boyfriend. Jiaoyang and I never broke up,” Lin Yu corrected. </p> 
 <p>Lina pulled Sheng Jiaoyang to the front to find their own seats.</p> 
 <p>“Before, I’d thought that you’d really gotten over him. I didn’t think that you went and dug another pit instead.” Lina’s face was serious as she stared at Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>“What other pit?” Sheng Jiaoyang was bewildered. </p> 
 <p>Lina patted her shoulder. “Don’t play dumb with me! Tell me honestly, do you still have feelings for Lin Yan?” </p> 
 <p>“I do!” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s reply was calm, surprising Lina. Her voice was anxious as she said, “Jiaojiao, I haven’t told you yet, but Lin Yan is about to get engaged.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes widened, and a trace of astonishment flitted through her eyes as she pursed her lips. She was currently filled with complicated emotions.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Jiaojiao. I never told you because I didn’t want you to feel sad, but right now, I have no choice but to warn you. Lin Yan isn’t worthy of your love.” Lina gripped Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang released a giggle as she raised a hand to pat Lina’s cheek. “Mei Niu, don’t start demeaning your brother just for me. If he wasn’t worthy of my love, would I have foolishly chased after him for so long? Don’t worry, I’ve long gotten over it. Right now, I have more important things to worry about than romance. I’m not going to go on a wild goose chase for him again.” </p> 
 <p>“Then, what’s up with that ex-boyfriend of yours? He looks just like Lin Yan. Can you honestly say that you aren’t using him as a substitute?”</p> 
 <p>“Substitute? Probably. However, the most important thing is that he was Sheng Shiyun’s male god!” </p> 
 <p>“Sheng Shiyun? Isn’t she your half-sister with a different mother? Oh, I remember now, you talked about this before. Only, this person really looks similar to Lin Yan. If I didn’t know better, I would’ve thought they were brothers.” Lina glanced behind them, her last sentence a regretful sigh. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled as she turned her phone off and watched the screen go dark. She couldn’t help but think about what Mei Niu had said earlier. Lin Yan was getting engaged…as for who, she didn’t want to find out. </p> 
 <p>In the future, they’d be strangers. </p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>
