 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang next met Lina, her stomach was already very swollen.</p> 
 <p>"Hi, baby." Sheng Jiaoyang placed her head against Lina's stomach and greeted the baby softly.</p> 
 <p>"Your man actually allowed you to come alone? Since when did he become so relaxed about your safety?" Lina teased.</p> 
 <p>"Do you really think I came here alone? Go out and have a look. My bodyguards are all lined outside," Sheng Jiaoyang replied helplessly.</p> 
 <p>The smile was gone from Lina's face. "You shouldn't complain. He's afraid that history would repeat itself."</p> 
 <p>"You have no idea. That dude looks like a super serious guy, but actually he…"</p> 
 <p>The two friends came together and chatted heartily between themselves, their peals of laughter ringing out from time to time. They seemed to have returned to the days when they were always stuck together and looking out for each other.</p> 
 <p>They were as thick as thieves and the time they spent together was priceless. Even though they had gone through a lot in the past few years, their relationship was even stronger than love. It was so strong that they both believed in one thing:</p> 
 <p>Even if years had passed and love no longer existed, they would still be each other's safest harbor.</p> 
 <p>In this world, there existed a friendship that would last forever.</p> 
 <p>There existed a friendship so sweet that their significant others would get jealous.</p> 
 <p>There existed a friendship that would make one give up their principles for the other party.</p> 
 <p>This friendship was the friendship between Mei Niu and Little Sun.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, let's think of a nickname or Chinese name for our son," Lina laid her head on Sheng Jiaoyang's shoulder as she looked out of the French window at the sunset.</p> 
 <p>Currently, Lina was having one of those rare moments when her body and mind were both at ease. Her brows weren't pressed together, and she had a gentle countenance. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang placed her hand on Lina's belly and felt the heartbeat of the life inside of her. The thought that her godson was in Lina’s belly triggered a wave of intense anticipation and extraordinary intimacy that welled up within her.</p> 
 <p>"A nickname…" Sheng Jiaoyang was in deep thoughts.</p> 
 <p>"I’ll like anything you come up with," Lina smiled and said.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at her. "If I gave him a name like Sweetie or Cutie, you’ll still like it?"</p> 
 <p>"… This is your son as well."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang let out a chuckle and thought that if she really gave the baby a nickname like Xiao Tiantian<span id="footnote-ref-cd10"><a href="#footnote-cd10">[1]</a></span>, the kid would definitely hate her to the core when he grows up.</p> 
 <p>Imagine a sporty and handsome boy drenched in sweat, and suddenly, on the sidelines came the cheers, "Strive on, Xiao Tiantian!"</p> 
 <p>"Pft—Haha!"</p> 
 <p>"Haha, I thought of something funny. Imagine if your son is named Xiao Tiantian, and if I have a daughter next time, I will name her Xiao Zhuangzhuang <span id="footnote-ref-26f6"><a href="#footnote-26f6">[2]</a></span>. Wouldn't that be super fun?" Sheng Jiaoyang was tickled pink.</p> 
 <p>Lina burst into laughter. To be honest, after hearing what Sheng Jiaoyang said, even she found this idea extremely hilarious.</p> 
 <p>"What are you girls chatting about? You all look so happy."</p> 
 <p>The two girls turned back in unison to see Sven coming in from the porch and tugging at his tie. Judging from the way he tugged at his tie, it was apparent that he was so familiar with this place that he felt at ease, as though this was his home.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow and looked at Lina. Of course, she knew that Sven was living with Lina. But, she was still surprised to see that Sven was acting like a husband that had just returned home from work. This person, who was once a notorious playboy, seemed to have become a male eagle that cared greatly for his female partner without even realizing it. Or perhaps, he had realized it, but he enjoyed doing it.</p> 
 <p>The smile on Lina's face faded slightly. With a faint smile, she said, "We are thinking of a name for our boy."</p> 
 <p>Sven looked at Sheng Jiaoyang before turning to look at Lina. "So, have you girls decided on one yet?"</p> 
 <p>"We thought of one," Lina looked at the bag he was carrying in his other hand, "What did you buy?"</p> 
 <p>"Fruits and vegetables. Be right back, I'll go wash them."</p> 
 <p>As Sven walked towards the kitchen, Sheng Jiaoyang's mouth became slightly parted in amusement. She turned to look at Lina and whispered to her, "I was wondering why there isn’t a nanny around. Could it be that he has been personally taking care of you these days?"</p> 
 <p>Lina smiled— a silent affirmative.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes were filled with wonder. "Mei Niu, how did you manage to achieve this? I'm afraid that even my Mr. Shen wouldn't be able to do something like this."</p> 
 <p>People like them were born with a golden spoon, and they grew up ordering their servants around. There was no way they would get involved in such tedious household chores. So, when she saw Sven, a person with such a background, actually head to the kitchen to help her Mei Niu wash fruits… <em>Tsk tsk!</em></p> 
 <p>"I'll tell you about it tonight," Lina looked in the direction of the kitchen.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded. Now, she was extremely curious as to what methods Mei Niu used to actually pull someone who is used to standing on an exceptionally high altar back into the mortal realm.</p> 
 <p>When Sven entered with a fruit platter that was filled with various fruits that were properly washed, cut, and arranged in a visually appetizing manner, the amazement in Sheng Jiaoyang's heart had accumulated and hit the peak.</p> 
 <p>Sven placed the fruit platter at the spot closest to the two women before he sat on the single seat sofa on the other side. With his hands interlocked and placed on his crossed legs, he casually leaned against the backrest, his gaze silently lingering on the two before finally landing on Lina's belly. The territory that originally belonged to him was now occupied by a slender white hand. His eyes narrowed slightly.</p> 
 <p>"Miss Xu, did you come alone? Does Mr. Shen know about it?" He seemed to ask casually.</p> 
 <p>"Didn't you notice all the strange faces outside when you entered? I'm not like a certain someone who would do something before they sought permission. I informed Mr. Shen before I left the house," Sheng Jiaoyang lifted her chin slightly. Ever since she learnt about what Sven did, her impression of him had always been negative. </p> 
 <p>Sven let out a chuckle, "Is Miss Xu referring to me?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang gave a half-hearted laugh, "I didn't say that. You did."</p> 
 <p>"Did you capture Mr Shen's heart with that glib tongue of yours?" A similar half-hearted smile appeared on Sven's face.</p> 
 <p>"Mr. Sven, you’re wrong. There's no other way to capture someone’s heart other than exchanging your own heart for theirs. Hah, you won't understand even if I told you anyway."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang then leaned against Lina's stomach and deliberately said, "My son, people say sons take after their mothers. So, you will definitely be a faithful, loyal, and good boy."</p> 
 <p>Sven could feel a twitch in the middle of his brows.</p> 
 <p>Lina burst out laughing. It was so interesting to see the two of them bicker. She couldn't help but recall how George used to seek every opportunity to bicker with Jiaojiao, but could never outtalk her.</p> 
 <p>*George… *</p> 
 <p>Lina's smile vanished all of a sudden.</p> 
 <p>Sven noticed the change in her expression. <em>She has clearly thought of someone who she shouldn't have.</em> His gaze darkened as he diverted the topic, "Didn't you say that you thought of a name? What is it?"</p> 
 <p>Lina was pulled back into reality, and she answered, "Sweit."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked and couldn't help but look at Lina and questioned her with her eyes. <em>Are you sure?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Sweit sounded just like the English word, Sweet. If the child learns of the origin of his name in the future, would he suffer from psychological trauma?</em></p> 
 <p>Sven reiterated the name, but he didn't suspect anything. He simply said, "If you like the name, then let’s name him just that."</p> 
 <p>"Of course I do," Lina turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang with a smiling glint in her eyes. <em>I'm waiting for your Xiao Zhuangzhuang.</em></p>
