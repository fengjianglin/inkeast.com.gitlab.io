 <p>They stepped out of the house together, early in the morning.</p> 
 <p>After stepping into the car, Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining with a strange look in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Shen Zhining raised a brow. </p> 
 <p>“I didn’t think you would continue to play on your phone even after saying good night, just like everyone else.” <em>Moreover, he was even scrolling on Weibo!</em> </p> 
 <p>“What’s so strange about that? I’m also a person.” </p> 
 <p>That’s true. Sheng Jiaoyang thought of what she saw last night, and she couldn’t help but laugh. To be honest, the thought of a big man lying in bed, scrolling through Weibo, and typing comments was really funny.</p> 
 <p>“What are you laughing at?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was laughing uncontrollably, to the extent that she had to close her eyes and think of a way to change the topic. “What do you normally look at on Weibo?” </p> 
 <p>“Stuff relating to you.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wasn’t surprised in the slightest by Shen Zhining’s words. She could even predict what he would say. </p> 
 <p>“Anything else?” </p> 
 <p>“Nope.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t believe it. “You don’t follow anything apart from stuff concerning me?” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to look at her. “What do you think I should be following?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m not you, so how could I know what you would follow? Maybe…” <em>Cough, cough.</em> She stopped herself just in time. </p> 
 <p>However, Shen Zhining wasn’t so easily dismissed, “Maybe what?” </p> 
 <p><em>Maybe you were researching what I might say. Otherwise, how come you always leave me speechless?</em> </p> 
 <p>“Nothing.” Sheng Jiaoyang blinked, and pretended to calmly turn her head and stare out the window. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wrapped his arm around her shoulder and leaned closer to her. “What do you mean by nothing?” </p> 
 <p>Seeing how stubborn he was, Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the chauffeur, Man Jun, and whispered, “What else would somebody secretly watch in the middle of the night?” </p> 
 <p>“What would I watch?” Shen Zhining looked at her teasingly. </p> 
 <p>“Hmph, you obviously know what I am talking about!” Sheng Jiaoyang turned her head away to hide her blush. </p> 
 <p>His lips moved right by her ear, “Shall we watch it together tonight?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang closed her eyes and took a deep breath before glancing at him, “You can watch it yourself. Tonight, I’ll be discussing the script with Qin Anling and Ma Tingting. I might come home late.” </p> 
 <p>“Where? I’ll pick you up.” </p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, it’s not like you’re my driver. I can’t let you send me back and forth every day.” </p> 
 <p>“I’m willing to be your driver for a lifetime.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was once again caught off guard by Shen Zhining’s teasing. Nowadays, Boss Shen’s attractiveness was at the peak, and he could casually flirt with every sentence. </p> 
 <p>His flirting skills made it hard for her to believe that he hadn’t secretly watched those videos. </p> 
 <p>“Just contact me after you finish your work. I’ll tell you where I am then. Right now, I’m still not sure where I’ll be going later. We’re probably going to the company first, but we might go out for a snack later.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded. </p> 
 <p>When they arrived at Entertainment International, Shen Zhining held the car door for Sheng Jiaoyang before speaking, “Oh, I almost forgot. Wight and Daisy are holding their wedding at the end of the month, and they invited us to their wedding.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was just about to step out, but she immediately stopped herself and turned to look at Shen Zhining with shock. “So fast? Didn’t they only confirm their relationship two months ago?” </p> 
 <p>“Wight’s already been pining for her for a very long time.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang immediately remembered that time when Prince Wight tried to test Daisy’s sincerity. The result was obviously good, and Daisy wasn’t lured away by Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Now that she thought about it, it was understandable why Prince Wight would want to hold the wedding so quickly. She could already predict how much Prince Wight would pamper Daisy in the future. </p> 
 <p>“That’s good, I’ll set some time aside for that,” Sheng Jiaoyang said. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pulled her hand and said, “Daisy wanted you to be her maid of honour.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised a brow, “Why didn’t she ask me directly?” </p> 
 <p>“She was worried you would reject her. So, she made her request through Wight.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang found the change very mystical. Initially, Daisy wanted her to back off from Shen Zhining, and she tried to drive her away from his side. During Jarett’s banquet, she even wanted to trip her. After that, Daisy’s family began to go into decline. She only helped Daisy deal with those two girls, and now, Daisy suddenly wants to invite her to be her only maid of honour?</p> 
 <p>How did they go from love rivals to friends? Furthermore, for her to be invited as the only maid of honour meant that Daisy clearly considers her a close friend. This development was a bit too fast. </p> 
 <p>“She’s not trying to prank me, right?” Sheng Jiaoyang almost couldn’t believe it. </p> 
 <p>“Nah, you’ll be the last person they would dare to tease. After all, I’m their biggest creditor.”</p> 
 <p>That’s true. Shen Zhining also helped Daisy’s family with their debt, and the responsibility of paying it back naturally fell back upon Daisy and Wight’s shoulders. It’s just that now, both of them owed their debt to Shen Zhining instead of their previous debtors. </p> 
 <p>“Alright then, let them know that I agree. To be the maid of honour for a future princess would definitely be a really interesting experience,” Sheng Jiaoyang said. Of course, she didn’t agree just because the couple was some prince and princess. Rather, she only did it because she had some sympathy for Daisy. She actually doesn’t have a single friend left now, and even had to call her former love rival to serve as her maid of honour. </p> 
 <p>“Alright, I’m going.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled at Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pulled her into a kiss before finally letting her out of the car. </p> 
 <p>The bodyguard waiting outside the door looked completely solemn, but the slight twitching of his lips gave away his true mood. </p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan, who had gone down to greet them, also saw the scene and couldn’t help but recall all the PDA that President Shen had shown at the fan meet and greet yesterday. You really couldn’t judge a book by its cover. Mr. Shen appeared so cold and restrained, yet who would’ve thought he would be so clingy? He was acting like he was afraid that nobody could see how lovey-dovey they are. </p> 
 <p>Now, even the people who thought Jiaojiao was the weaker party in the relationship could see that, with all the PDA, if the two ever broke up, it would definitely be Jiaojiao dumping President Shen, and not the other way around. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang saw that Zeng Huan was completely stunned, and she walked over and poked her forehead. “What are you doing? Let’s go.” </p> 
 <p>“Oh!” Zeng Huan recovered.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, Jiaojiao!” Somebody dashed over, but was quickly blocked by the bodyguards.</p> 
 <p>“Reporter Peng! It’s you?” Zeng Huan recognized the person who had just run over. </p> 
 <p>“Yep, it’s me.” Peng Peng nodded. </p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, “Did you want something?”</p> 
 <p>Peng Peng revealed her brightest smile as she said, “Jiaojiao, may I ask if you have time to accept an interview? I only need ten minutes. Actually, just a few minutes is good.” </p> 
 <p>“Is it already the end of the year again?” Sheng Jiaoyang thought back to what happened last year.</p> 
 <p>Peng Peng was startled, and her smile turned a little helpless as she said, “Yep. This time, the editor-in-chief wants to rely on your exclusive interview to raise our sales. Because I did your previous interview, I was pushed up to do the job.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang actually valued this little reporter. Although Reporter Peng was young, her social skills were quite good. She knew that it was better to speak the truth instead of weaving a bunch of excuses. Sheng Jiaoyang could tell that as long as she was given a chance, she would definitely be able to rise up to a good position. </p> 
 <p>“Come up with me.” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Peng Peng before walking to the main hall. </p> 
 <p>Peng Peng followed her happily. </p> 
 <p>“Miss Xu, good morning!” the two clerks at the front desk greeted her. </p> 
 <p>“Morning!” Sheng Jiaoyang replied briefly. </p> 
 <p>Peng Peng followed behind her and didn’t feel anything in particular as she rode in the executive elevator with Sheng Jiaoyang. Only when they reached the highest floor and walked into the innermost office did she feel that something was wrong. </p> 
 <p>She remembered that the previous interview hadn’t been conducted here. When she entered, she noticed ‘Chairman’s office’ was written on the door plate…</p> 
 <p><em>The chairman’s office!!!</em></p> 
 <p>Peng Peng’s eyes widened. She knew she just discovered a very big secret. It was definitely a secret. Otherwise, everybody would’ve long known about such big news.</p> 
 <p>A few knocks sounded on the door and Xu Ping walked in with a folder in hand. </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping noticed there was another person in the office, and she couldn’t help but glance at Peng Peng a few times. Clearly, she recognized her. </p> 
 <p>“Reporter Peng, I don’t seem to remember approving your interview request.” Xu Ping frowned at Peng Peng. </p> 
 <p>Peng Peng hastily explained, “I asked Jiaojiao directly for an interview. I’m very sorry for not passing it through you first.” </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping calmed down after hearing the sincerity in Peng Peng’s voice. However, she still didn’t really approve of Peng Peng’s actions. If everybody acted like Peng Peng, Jiaojiao would be horribly bothered.</p> 
 <p>“Take a seat first. A’Huan, help me brew a cup of tea.” Sheng Jiaoyang pointed at the sofa and motioned for Peng Peng to take a seat before sitting herself behind the work table and picking up and flipping through the folder Xu Ping handed her.</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for Peng Peng. </p> 
 <p>“Reporter Peng, this is for you.” </p> 
 <p>“Alright. Don’t worry about me Miss, you can focus on your work!” Peng Peng politely referred to Zeng Huan with honorifics. She didn’t dare to look down on anybody here. </p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan smiled, “Don’t say miss this, miss that. I’ll feel awkward.” </p> 
 <p>Peng Peng smiled back in reply as she glanced at the work table, secretly filled with excitement. She originally thought that Jiaojiao had good resources thanks to her powerful backers but, unexpectedly, she was an authoritative person herself. </p> 
 <p><em>If this was reported…</em></p> 
 <p>“Is there anyone else?” Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and asked Xu Ping, who was seated across from her.</p> 
 <p>“The company’s resources for young male artists are all here,” Xu Ping replied. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed one file after another to the table, muttering irresolutely as she looked through them. </p> 
 <p>“None of them fit what you’re looking for?” Xu Ping asked probingly. </p> 
 <p>“None of them have the kind of pure and simple sort of feeling that I want.” Sheng Jiaoyang shook her head. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, that pure and simple sort of feeling can be acted out as long as their acting skills are good…” Xu Ping tried to advise her. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang interrupted, “No, some things cannot be relied on acting. Otherwise, I wouldn’t need to find anyone. I would just go and negotiate with Gu Zhou or Zhang Yue.” </p> 
 <p>“Alright,” Xu Ping nodded, “Why don’t we go look for our male actor at the campus?” </p> 
 <p>“Let’s not worry about it now. This can wait till after I finish discussing the script with Qin Anliang and Ma Tingting. </p> 
 <p>Then, Sheng Jiaoyang stood up and walked toward Peng Peng. </p>
