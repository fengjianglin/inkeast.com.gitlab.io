<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Good morning, girls!”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan, who’d disappeared for a week, suddenly returned to the villa.</p> 
 <p>“Good morning, Teacher Zhuo!” the contestants responded in unison.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that everyone more or less looked thinner now, Zhuo Yiyan smiled slightly, and said in his usual graceful style, “To celebrate the end of your weeklong training, we’ll hold a party in the garden tonight…”</p> 
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, everyone started cheering.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan didn’t get angry at the interruption, and instead waited for them to calm down before continuing, “Now, let’s play a game first.”</p> 
 <p><em>A game?</em></p> 
 <p>The contestants all looked at each other in dismay. Some of them appeared nervous, while the rest seemed eager.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, everyone, follow me to the projection room.”</p> 
 <p>In the basement of the villa there was a well-equipped projection room, comparable to that of a luxury mini theatre.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan let the contestants sit separately, according to their teams.</p> 
 <p>“I have five videos here, and each video has three questions. Please watch them carefully. I will ask the questions, and each team will pick a person to answer. The team that answers the most questions correctly will be rewarded.”</p> 
 <p>Having said that, Zhuo Yiyan started the first video.</p> 
 <p>It was of a woman sitting in front of a dressing table. The woman wore a strapless floral dress, and had half of her hair tied up. She was currently looking at the dresser and all of the cosmetic products scattered over its surface. There were three different coloured lipsticks placed in front of her. After the camera took a close-up shot of the woman’s beautiful face, which showed that she’d left her lips bare, the camera refocused on the three lipsticks. The woman reached out to pick up a lipstick, but the video stopped before she grabbed one.</p> 
 <p>“Which colour will the woman choose? Coral orange, classic red, or rose red?”</p> 
 <p>“We pick our captain to answer!” Luo Yi’s team members said one after another, all except for Qi Hua, who was seen as an enemy. Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang had a good relationship with Luo Yi. </p> 
 <p>Upon seeing this, the other team also chose their captain, Xiao Yang, to represent them.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi, as a senior who’d been in the model industry for several years already, coupled with her good character and cheerful personality, had a good relationship with most of her team members. She asked for her team’s opinions, and everyone agreed to let her choose.</p> 
 <p>On the other side, Xiao Yang’s team wasn’t so unified, and although they’d chosen their captain, her team members had their own opinions. Xiao Yang was helpless. Since the minority had to comply with the majority, she chose the answer most voted for.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi chose coral orange.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Yang chose classic red.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan didn’t immediately announce the result. He took the remote control and pressed the play button, continuing the video.</p> 
 <p>The hand in the video picked up the coral orange lipstick. The lens then swept across the cosmetics on the dressing table before settling on the mirror. The woman in the mirror slowly applied the lipstick.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, you’re so awesome!” Luo Yi’s teammates all gave her a thumbs up.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, quick, watch the video again.” Luo Yi smiled.</p> 
 <p>Compared to the cheerful atmosphere in Luo Yi’s team, the mood in Xiao Yang’s team was low. </p> 
 <p>As the woman in the video finished applying the lipstick, she received a call, and the contestants could hear her say, “Okay, I’m heading down now.” After hanging up, the woman picked up a skirt and rushed out of the room.</p> 
 <p>The video was paused the moment the door closed.</p> 
 <p>“What is the woman preparing to do?” Zhuo Yiyan questioned.</p> 
 <p>“Captain, your thoughts?” the person beside Luo Yi asked.</p> 
 <p>“She’s dressed up so beautifully that I think she’s either going on a date or to a party,” Luo Yi replied.</p> 
 <p>“So, which one do we choose?”</p> 
 <p>“It must be to go on a date.”</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi’s team quickly decided their answer.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Lou Yi’s team had chosen date as their answer, most of Xiao Yang’s team told her to answer with date too. Xiao Yang, who had no other choice, could only comply with the majority once more.</p> 
 <p>The video continued to play once both teams had chosen their answers.</p> 
 <p>The scene was now downstairs in a parking lot, and was focused on a man exiting a car while holding a bouquet. In the next second, the woman walked out of the building wearing a smile on her face as she met the man. She accepted the bouquet and asked, “Where are we going?”</p> 
 <p>The video ended.</p> 
 <p>“Both of you answered correctly, so that’s one point for each team. Currently, Luo Yi’s team has two points. Now, please listen to the third question: What brand of perfume was placed on the dressing table in the video?”</p> 
 <p>Everyone exploded in an uproar.</p> 
 <p>“I just focused on the woman!”</p> 
 <p>“The camera was moving too fast! How could I pay attention to what was on the table?!”</p> 
 <p>“My god, this has caught me off guard! How can I now think of the brand of perfume?”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t manage to see any of the stuff on the dressing table.”</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t just the contestants who were bewildered; the viewers who’d been watching the National Supermodel live broadcast were also confused.</p> 
 <p>[Pfttt~]</p> 
 <p>[This god-like question…]</p> 
 <p>[Please accept my admiration!]</p> 
 <p>[Hahaha, they’re dumbfounded~~]</p> 
 <p>[I was having breakfast with my family and accidentally spat out the porridge in my mouth onto my father’s face when I heard the male god’s question! Unfortunately, my father was sitting in front of me…I don’t think I’ll live to see tomorrow’s sunrise…]</p> 
 <p>[I thought the first two questions were easy! As it turns out, the most difficult question was left till last. 23333333]</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan ignored the contestants’ complaints, and went on to say, “To make it fair, the team representatives will say their answer at the same time. Note that you can only answer once, and that it can’t be changed. You have two minutes to discuss it between your team members, and after that, I’ll count to three and you’ll say your answers.”</p> 
 <p>The two teams gathered to discuss possible answers.</p> 
 <p>Because Sheng Jiaoyang was the youngest in her team, the other team members thought that she was too inexperienced to know the answer. Due to this, they didn’t have any expectations and didn’t pay her any attention. </p> 
 <p>“Time’s up!” Zhuo Yiyan announced loudly.</p> 
 <p>Both teams were quiet.</p> 
 <p>After observing her team members discussion, and seeing that they had the wrong answer prepared, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t endure it any longer and said, “Captain, I know the perfume’s brand.”</p> 
 <p>“What is it?” Xiao Yang stared blankly for a moment before hurriedly asking.</p> 
 <p>“Charming Angel in the SL series of perfume brands developed by Lina,” Sheng Jiaoyang said with certainty.</p> 
 <p>A flash of surprise flashed across Zhuo Yiyan’s eyes. This question was designed to make things difficult for the contestants as the perfume wasn’t yet for sale in the country, and the perfume hadn’t even been on the market for a month. Basically, only a few people knew about it unless they were a die hard fan obsessed with Lina.</p> 
 <p>“You still won’t admit to Lina being your idol? If she’s not your idol, then why do you understand her so well? Your walk is like hers, and you even know the perfume she developed. Really, this little hypocrite!” Wang Wei was sitting beside Sheng Jiaoyang and lightly nudged her with her shoulder, a teasing expression on her face.</p> 
 <p>Hearing her strange tone of voice, Sheng Jiaoyang felt cold and shivered as goosebumps rose on her arms.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan clapped to get everyone’s attention, and said, “Alright, tell me your answers. Three, two, one!”</p> 
 <p>“Charming Angel!” the two captains answered in unison.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan rewound the video, and paused to when the perfume had appeared.</p> 
 <p>The perfume bottle had a unique silhouette on the sides, like a pair of wings. If one looked carefully, you could see the letters S and L imprinted on the bottle. From its appearance, this bottle of light pink perfume was more like a piece of art.</p> 
 <p>“This perfume only launched in Paris at the beginning of this month. I’m amazed that Jiaojiao could recognise it at a glance. Congratulations, each team scored one point,” Zhuo Yiyan said with a smile.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi’s team cheered once again, while the atmosphere in the other team wasn’t so good.</p>
