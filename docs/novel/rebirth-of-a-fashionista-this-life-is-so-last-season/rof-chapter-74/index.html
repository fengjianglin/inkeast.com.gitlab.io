 <p><em>Are you happy with the 6 million?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Of course she was!</em></p> 
 <p>Based on Sheng Jiaoyang’s current circumstances, this sum of money was a lot.</p> 
 <p>But, when that question was posed by Shen Zhining, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t laugh it off. <em>It turned out that Demon King Shen already knew…</em></p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked warily at Shen Zhining. <em>He wouldn’t bring up this matter for no reason. There must be more to this than meets the eye.</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stared at the Sheng Jiaoyang with an inscrutable look and didn’t speak.</p> 
 <p>Being stared at like this, especially by Shen Zhining, made her tense. As Sheng Jiaoyang drank a few more sips, she started to ponder the meaning behind Shen Zhining’s words. He certainly didn’t tell her that merely because he knew that there was something wrong with the contract. As she thought about what had just happened, and based on her understanding of Shen Zhining…<em>He certainly didn’t call her here just to use her as a shield.</em></p> 
 <p><em>How old was Demon King Shen this year?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang started to count on her fingers. <em>He was five years older than her, and she was supposed to be 20 years old this year. That is to say, Demon King Shen was only 25 years old…?</em></p> 
 <p><em>He’s still so young!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang looked up at Shen Zhining in astonishment. His aura was cold and aloof. If one didn’t deliberately calculate his age as she did now, no one would know that he was, in fact, this young. He didn’t appear old, it was just that he gave off a more sophisticated, mature vibe, and he didn’t possess the vigour and youthfulness of other people his age. </p> 
 <p>She reckoned that Grandfather Shen must be in a hurry to introduce someone to Shen Zhining in an attempt to change his grandson’s deportment.</p> 
 <p><em>But, obviously, the results weren’t good. Shen Zhining wasn’t appreciative of his grandfather’s thoughtfulness, and had instead found himself a shield.</em></p> 
 <p><em>And, this shield’s ‘halo’ sadly landed on her!</em></p> 
 <p>“You…want me to put on an act with you?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked directly.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining smiled. <em>As expected, this girl really knew him well.</em></p> 
 <p>Seeing the smile plastered on Shen Zhining’s face, Sheng Jiaoyang knew that she’d guessed correctly. A thought suddenly popped into her head, and she figured that this was a good opportunity. “It’s no big deal to put on an act with you, but what can I get out of this?” </p> 
 <p>If she agreed to Demon King Shen’s request too quickly, then he’d certainly suspect that she had an ulterior motive. Even if she did, there was no way she’d let the other know, or else, how could she possibly proceed with her plan?</p> 
 <p>“What else do you want?”</p> 
 <p>“Well…I don’t know yet.”</p> 
 <p><em>What a greedy girl!</em> The corners of Shen Zhining’s mouth curled upwards as he slowly took a sip of wine and said, “That will depend on your performance.”</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang got home, she was still wondering: <em>How could Demon King Shen possibly let her go so easily like this?</em></p> 
 <p>She kept pondering Demon King Shen’s last remark. <em>What did he mean by ‘that will depend on your performance’?</em></p> 
 <p>“Wasn’t it just a simple dinner? What took you so long?” Lina, who was wearing a facial mask, instantly sat up from the sofa.</p> 
 <p>“I ran into Shen Zhining.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang threw her bag aside and plopped down on the sofa, heaving a long sigh.</p> 
 <p>“What? Demon King Shen?” Lina took off her facial mask and looked at the Sheng Jiaoyang in bewilderment. “How did you run into him again?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang then recounted everything to Lina.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, it’s perfect! You were planning to approach him anyway. To think that he came knocking at your door…it looks like even the Heavens are helping you!” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded before standing up. “I’m going to shower. Let’s rest early and go shopping tomorrow!”</p> 
 <p>“I can’t.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Lina and asked, “Why? You have some other business to tend to again?”</p> 
 <p>“Yep, Fashion Week is about to begin, so I’ve got to prepare for it.”</p> 
 <p>“I see, then you should focus on your work first!”</p> 
 <p>“You’re also going to be busy because, this time, you’re going to help me prepare for it.”</p> 
 <p>“Ah??” Sheng Jiaoyang cast a suspicious look at Lina.</p> 
 <p>Lina laughed and said, “Times have changed. With your current qualifications, you can participate in Fashion Week without any issues. Little Sun, let’s walk the runway together!”</p> 
 <p>“I forgot to tell you, but I’ve already bought plane tickets…” Lina paused for a second before adding, “…for both of us.”</p> 
 <p>“…Alright, you win.”</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>

 <p>As you may have noticed, this is another short chapter. The author didn't explain why this time though. Following this, you may encounter one or two more short chapters. After that, the chapter length is back to normal and there are also chapters that are longer than the usual chapters (from chapter 100 onwards.)</p>
