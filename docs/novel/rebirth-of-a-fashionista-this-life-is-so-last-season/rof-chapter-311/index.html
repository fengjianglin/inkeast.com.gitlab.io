 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang returned to her room and once again dug out the diary her mother wrote. As she flipped through the pages, she tried to calm herself down, but the uneasiness in her heart grew stronger as time passed.</p> 
 <p>"Go and take a look if you are worried," a voice travelled into her ears.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to see Shen Zhining standing behind her with encouragement evident in his gaze.</p> 
 <p>Tears suddenly welled up in her eyes as she threw herself into Shen Zhining's embrace. She leaned her head on his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>"I don’t want him to die," Sheng Jiaoyang's voice trembled slightly.</p> 
 <p><em>I thought I already got over it and am not bothered by it anymore. But now, I realised that I have just been deliberately ignoring what's really on my mind.</em> </p> 
 <p>How could she not be worried? In her memories, Sheng Xun was her father who loved her like she was a precious treasure. Though he had changed, it couldn't erase all the good memories he had once given her. </p> 
 <p>"I know," Shen Zhining patted her back slightly.</p> 
 <p>As someone who had stayed with the Sheng Family for nearly two years, Shen Zhining was able to objectively make a judgement on how Sheng Xun treated Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Unlike Aunty Yang, Sheng Xun would purposely warn Shen Zhining viciously behind Aunty Yang's back whenever he caught Shen Zhining bullying Sheng Jiaoyang. Sheng Xun would threaten Shen Zhining to not bully his princess, or he would chase the latter out of the house. But at that time, Shen Zhining was no longer a young kid who knew nothing. He knew that Sheng Xun was just putting on a brave front, so he completely disregarded his warning and continued doing what he did. Sometimes, he would even childishly make Sheng Jiaoyang run errands for him right in front of Sheng Xun.</p> 
 <p>"If you can't let it go, then go see him," Shen Zhining continued.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lifted her head and took in a deep breath before she turned and walked out.</p> 
 <p>"I'll accompany you," Shen Zhining caught up with her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang originally wanted to call Sheng Xun, but after scrolling through her contacts list, she realised that she couldn't find his number. Only then did she recall that she had never saved his number.</p> 
 <p>After arriving at the Sheng Family’s doorsteps, Sheng Jiaoyang alighted the car hurriedly and pressed the doorbell. </p> 
 <p>"Who is it? Eh? Xu Jiaojiao is here again~" a voice came from the transmitter at the doorbell.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang waited for a few minutes, but the door remained shut, prompting her to press the doorbell once more.</p> 
 <p>All the while, Shen Zhining stood beside her and watched as she did what she did.</p> 
 <p>The voice of a young nanny sounded out from the transmitter, "I'm sorry Miss Xu, Old Madam and Old Master don't want to see you."</p> 
 <p>"I'm looking for Sheng Xun," Sheng Jiaoyang's face turned a shade darker.</p> 
 <p>"Master is not in currently. He has been admitted to the hospital."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang furrowed her brows and asked, "Which hospital is he admitted to?"</p> 
 <p>"It's… er, I can't tell you. Old Madam and the others would be upset if I told you."</p> 
 <p>"I'm not here to stir trouble," Sheng Jiaoyang looked into the camera.</p> 
 <p>"I'm really sorry, Miss Xu. Though I really like you personally, I'm just an employee, and I can't go against my employer's wishes."</p> 
 <p>Slight anxiety appeared on Sheng Jiaoyang's expression. She wanted to say something when Shen Zhining pulled her with him towards the car.</p> 
 <p>"I will help you find out where he is," Shen Zhining said.</p> 
 <p>After hearing his words, Sheng Jiaoyang didn't want to argue with the young nanny anymore. She was confident that with Shen Zhining's ability, he would definitely be able to find out which hospital Sheng Xun was admitted into.</p> 
 <p>An hour later, they received news on which hospital Sheng Xun was admitted to, and they immediately drove over.</p> 
 <p>However, when they reached the entrance of the door, they were halted by someone.</p> 
 <p>"It's the Peerless Couple. How are both of you related to my uncle? You guys are here the moment my uncle was admitted. Who told you?" With his arms folded, Sheng Yi blocked them from going in.</p> 
 <p>"Get lost," Sheng Jiaoyang shot an icy glare at Sheng Yi.</p> 
 <p>She didn't have a good impression of the relatives from the paternal side of her family, and that included Sheng Yi. In those two years, Sheng Yi came to their house to stay for some time, and whenever that was a conflict between both of them, her grandparents would side with Sheng Yi.</p> 
 <p>"Why should I get lost? Both of you should get lost," Sheng Yi's gaze was filled with contempt. "The person lying inside is my biological uncle, and he could even become my legal father in the future. Who are you two?"</p> 
 <p>"Could it be…" Sheng Yi scrutinized Sheng Jiaoyang with a strange gaze.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt a twitch in her brows, "What are you trying to imply?"</p> 
 <p>Some distance away, a certain person secretly started filming with their mobile phone.</p> 
 <p>"You are my uncle's illegitimate daughter, aren't you! Now that my uncle's condition has worsened, you are here to acknowledge him and get his inheritance." Sheng Yi’s face seemed to be conveying the following message: <em>I've seen through you! He was displaying obvious contempt and caution.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang almost wanted to burst out in laughter. <em>To think that he could come up with something like this. This person sure has a good imagination.</em></p> 
 <p>She stretched out a hand and pushed Sheng Yi out of the way, before forcefully barging into the ward.</p> 
 <p>"Hey, who allowed you in?" Sheng Yi wanted to stop her again, but Shen Zhining shoved him out of the way with his shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang entered the ward, and was greeted with the sight of Sheng Xun lying on the bed with his eyes closed. He was wearing an oxygen mask while being hooked up to a ventilator and an IV drip.</p> 
 <p>This was the first time she had seen Sheng Xun in such a weak and fragile state; he looked as though he could leave this world at any moment.</p> 
 <p>"He was still fine when we were at the cemetery, so how…" Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't believe her eyes.</p> 
 <p>"His condition deteriorated the moment he left the cemetery. Did you guys infuriate him? It's all your fault if anything happens to my uncle!" Sheng Yi shouted.</p> 
 <p>"Shut up!" Sheng Jiaoyang rebuked.</p> 
 <p>"You should be the one to shut up! Xu Jiaojiao, don't think that you are so high and mighty just because you are some stupid celebrity with a few fans. You are just selling yourself," Sheng Yi rebutted in an obstinate and unruly manner.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining pinned Sheng Yi against the wall and warned him, "Just shut up when you are told to."</p> 
 <p>"Who do you think you are? Don't act so high and mighty just because you have some money. Let go of me. I am going to get the security to throw you guys out," Sheng Yi struggled against Shen Zhining's hold</p> 
 <p>"Yo, what's going on?" A woman who sounded elated to join the party could be heard from the door.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked up, and he was stunned instantly.</p> 
 <p>The woman's beautiful appearance and high spirits was extremely similar to the previous Sheng Jiaoyang. If he didn't know Jiaojiao was Sheng Jiaoyang, this would have definitely caused a great misunderstanding.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at the entrance. When she saw the person who entered the room, her eyes narrowed as an ineffable anger in her heart started to burn.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Yi looked towards the source of the voice, and he was left completely dumbstruck.</p> 
 <p>"Sheng… Sheng Jiaoyang? Aren't you dead?"</p> 
 <p>"Cousin, it's me."</p> 
 <p>"You… you are Sheng Shiyun?" After carefully discerning her voice, Sheng Yi felt even more certain that he was staring a ghost in the face.</p> 
 <p>"Yeah, are you surprised to see how I look now?" Sheng Shiyun lifted a hand to lightly caress her face and said elatedly.</p> 
 <p>"What the hell did you do to yourself? Doesn't it freak you out when you look into the mirror?" Sheng Yi could feel the goosebumps all over him.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt very uncomfortable and upset when she saw that Sheng Shiyun even tried to replicate her previous disposition. When she thought that Sheng Shiyun would be going around with this face to do unpresentable things, she couldn't help but want to tear that face off Sheng Shiyun.</p> 
 <p>"Don't you think I'm very beautiful now?" Sheng Shiyun smiled.</p> 
 <p>"No matter what, you shouldn't change yourself to be like a dead person. That's so terrifying! And why are you here? Uncle has already chased your mother and you out of the Sheng family," Sheng Yi's face was filled with caution.</p> 
 <p>The smile on Sheng Shiyun's face dissipated instantly. She glanced at Sheng Yi gloomily and lifted her head high as she walked arrogantly towards the side of the bed and said, "Even if he chased me and my mother out of the family, we are still one family. Now, other than Grandfather and Grandmother, I’m the closest person to him. Half of the blood that is flowing in my body comes from him."</p> 
 <p>"Hmph, you still don't know about it yet, do you? Very soon, I will be adopted under his name. As for you, just keep staying put wherever you are." Sheng Yi retorted.</p> 
 <p>"Shut up, if you guys want to quarrel, get out and quarrel!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun walked over and stood on the other side of the bed. She looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, who was standing opposite her. "Shouldn't you be the one to shut up the most? I'm his biological daughter, and Sheng Yi is his nephew. You? You are nothing, so what gives you the right to order us to shut up?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang threw an icy glance at Sheng Shiyun. Looking at Sheng Shiyun's face made her increasingly uncomfortable as the seconds passed by. Thus, she didn't want to stay in the ward any longer and turned to head out. She was disgusted by the fact that Sheng Shiyun was using her original face and going around, striking an attitude.</p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao, to think that you have hidden your identity so well. Don't ever dream that you can get a share of his inheritance just because you are an illegitimate child. Hmph, all your efforts will be in vain!" Sheng Shiyun exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Without turning her head around, Sheng Jiaoyang paused and replied, "Speaking of an illegitimate child, aren't you the best example?!"</p> 
 <p>"You…" Sheng Shiyun was infuriated. The words ‘illegitimate child’ was a forbidden hot button of hers. If anyone was to label her as an "illegitimate child", she would definitely hate that person for life.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn't bother to engage in any more meaningless conversations with Sheng Shiyun and left the ward.</p> 
 <p>When Shen Zhining caught up with her, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly threw out a question, "How did you feel when you saw someone who looked so similar to me appear in front of you?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her, and reached out his hand to hold hers. Then, he replied, "I only want to destroy her face. How is she deserving of having your appearance?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining's reply slightly calmed the raging fire in Sheng Jiaoyang. She turned to look at the ward Sheng Xun was in. A cold and icy glint formed in her eyes. "Great."</p> 
 <p>When Shen Zhining didn't reply to what she said, she looked up to see that he was looking back at her. The expression on her face changed as she asked, "Do you feel that I am cruel?"</p> 
 <p>Yet, Shen Zhining smiled, "I thought you were going to go through much trouble and expend much effort to solve this troublesome matter by yourself."</p> 
 <p>"I originally planned to take care of her by myself, but now I don't wish to see Sheng Shiyun put on airs in front of me using my face."</p> 
 <p>"You should have let me take care of her long ago, lest she be an eyesore to you," replied Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining without replying.</p> 
 <p>"What?"</p> 
 <p>"I feel that I am getting more reliant on you." In the past, when she experienced things like this, she would have never thought of asking someone else to help her take care of it. But now, she had started to think about achieving her aims through Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>A smiling glint appeared in Shen Zhining's eyes. "In the future, please continue to rely on me."</p>
