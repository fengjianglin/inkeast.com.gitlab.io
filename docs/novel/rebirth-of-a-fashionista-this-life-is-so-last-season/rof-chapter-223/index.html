 <p>“We’re here.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was softly awakened.</p> 
 <p>She took off her eye mask and put on her glasses, observing her surroundings. Seeing that everyone was heading out, she grabbed her purse and followed Gu Zhou down the plane.</p> 
 <p>“The car is already waiting outside the airport. Later on, you can take a nap in the car since the car ride is going to be a few hours,” Gu Zhou said to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“Ok.” Sheng Jiaoyang was feeling slightly depressed.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t know if it was because she didn’t get enough sleep or because of something else.</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhh, Gu Zhou!!!”</p> 
 <p>“Prince Charming Gu, look here!”</p> 
 <p>They’d just walked out of the plane when they heard excited screams.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, who was a bit unenergetic, was startled by this commotion and she immediately became alert. She pushed the frames of her glasses up her nose and teased Gu Zhou, “Your fans are quite enthusiastic.”</p> 
 <p>“Your fans are here too.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked around, and as expected, she saw a few Jiao fans mixed into the crowd holding up banners saying ‘Sis Jiao.’ Sis Jiao was the endearment that her fans had given her. The leader of the fan club had started to call her that, and then the fans had followed suit.</p> 
 <p>“Did you guys leak your whereabouts on the public account?” Seeing so many fans, Cen Jin knitted his eyebrows. The purpose of this trip was to finish shooting all the second male lead’s scenes, so the itinerary was kept confidential. Due to this, no security personnel had been arranged.</p> 
 <p>The group of fans had already surrounded them.</p> 
 <p>“Prince Charming Gu, I like you a lot. Can you give me an autograph?”</p> 
 <p>“Prince Charming Gu, Prince Charming Gu, did you see our Xiaozuo?”</p> 
 <p>“Prince Charming Gu, please take a picture with me~”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou glanced at the group of young girls and his gaze swept across the banner saying ‘Zhongli Xiaozuo’ and smiled. “So, you guys are Xiaozuo’s fans. I didn’t see Xiaozuo, so you guys will have to wait for a while.”</p> 
 <p>“Prince Charming Gu is so handsome!!”</p> 
 <p>“Please take a group photo with us! Please give us your autograph! Please give us a hug!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, who was squeezed to the side by the girls, also met her fans.</p> 
 <p>There weren’t that many Jiao fans, just a total of five people. Two of them were actually male.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I like you so much and I love your acting as Zhen Xin!” one of the males excitedly gushed while trembling in happiness. He was still wearing his school uniform.</p> 
 <p>“Today’s not the weekend, so you should be in school. Did you skip class?” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the excited fan.</p> 
 <p>“I requested a leave of absence,” the male explained.</p> 
 <p>“You shouldn’t do that! It’ll delay your progress in class,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied with disapproval.</p> 
 <p>The male hurriedly waved his hands and explained, “No, no. We’re just studying this half of the semester.”</p> 
 <p>“How did you guys know my flight was today?” Since the girls surrounding Gu Zhou weren't specifically waiting for him, she knew that the flight number wasn’t leaked. But, the Jiao fans were holding banners with her name, so they were clearly waiting for her.</p> 
 <p>“Leader told the fans who were nearby to come and meet you,” the delicate and tiny female fan immediately responded.</p> 
 <p>“I see.”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, can I get your autograph? I’m about to take the college entrance exam and would like it as a form of encouragement,” the excited male eagerly requested.</p> 
 <p>“Of course.” Sheng Jiaoyang took the male fan’s autograph book and even asked for his name. After signing her name, she wrote a blessing: <em>I hope that Xiao Huai will get top marks on the college entrance exam.</em></p> 
 <p>Xiao Huai clearly became even more excited after seeing what she wrote, and he ecstatically exclaimed, “Jiaojiao, I’ll definitely become your junior brother this year.”</p> 
 <p>“Ok, good luck!” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled before signing autographs for her four other fans. Due to the lack of time, they took a group photo together instead.</p> 
 <p>When she got in the car, Cen Jin commented, “Your fans are quick.”</p> 
 <p>Everyone could tell that only her fans had genuinely come to meet her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang cast him an innocent look and said, “It is a surprise indeed.”</p> 
 <p>The car drove towards their filming destination. From the airport, it was about a 5 hour car ride.</p> 
 <p>By the time they arrived near the mountain, it would definitely be nighttime.</p> 
 <p>For safety reasons, they decided to stay overnight at the nearest town and then head out the next morning.</p> 
 <p>They checked into the best hotel in the town.</p> 
 <p>Knock, knock, knock!</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had just finished touring her room when she heard a knock.</p> 
 <p>“Who is it?” She walked to the door but didn’t immediately open it.</p> 
 <p>“It’s me, it’s me!” an excited female voice replied outside the door.</p> 
 <p>Because the door was distorting the voice, it was a bit hard to tell who it was, but Jiaoyang found it to be slightly familiar.</p> 
 <p>A questioning gaze flickered in Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes and she chose to open the door.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I missed you so much~” A person immediately pounced on her.</p> 
 <p>If she hadn’t managed to see who it was in time, Sheng Jiaoyang would’ve ducked out of the way.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Wei?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m so happy. Jiaojiao, you still remember me!”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not like I lost my memory.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed Wang Wei to the side and then observed her face, saying bluntly, “You must be enjoying your life seeing how chubby you’ve gotten!”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei touched her chubby face and then her stomach, saying, “Hey, I’m pregnant, so I’m definitely going to be fat!”</p> 
 <p><em>Pregnant?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang was shocked upon noticing Wang Wei’s slightly swollen stomach. It seemed like Wang Wei was about five months pregnant, and it had only been six months since the National Supermodel competition had ended. This meant that she’d gotten pregnant not long after the competition.</p> 
 <p>At this time, the door beside hers opened and Gu Zhou walked out of the room, asking, “Is it someone you know?”</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhh, Prince Charming Gu!” Wang Wei screamed.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips twitched and she muttered, “Wang Wei, as a pregnant woman, can you tone it down a bit?”</p> 
 <p>“I can’t. Prince Charming Gu is actually staying in our hotel too. We’re so lucky!” Wang Wei glanced at Gu Zhou, utterly enchanted.</p> 
 <p>“This is your hotel?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>“It’s my husband’s. Prince Charming Gu, Prince Charming Gu, can you sign an autograph? Oh no, let’s just take a picture together. Can we?” Wang Wei had already fallen for Prince Charming Gu’s radiance.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou laughed, but he didn’t reject her.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei was eager and rushed over to take a few pictures with Gu Zhou, changing her pose consecutively.</p> 
 <p>“Enough, Wang Wei!” Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly exclaimed after seeing that this woman wasn’t about to be done anytime soon.</p> 
 <p>“Bye, Prince Charming Gu!” Wang Wei looked back with every step she took.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou laughed and returned to his room.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei finally snapped out of her trance once she couldn’t see her Prince Charming Gu anymore.</p> 
 <p>“Oh my god, I didn’t think that I could meet you guys here. I thought that I’d only be able to see you guys on TV. Prince Charming Gu is even more handsome now that I’ve taken a look up close.” Wang Wei cupped her face, completely smitten.</p> 
 <p>“Come in first so we can talk.” Sheng Jiaoyang walked into the room, and Wang Wei hurriedly followed.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, you haven’t changed at all. Oh no, you became even more beautiful!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sat by the bedside and motioned for Wang Wei to sit down too.</p> 
 <p>When Wang Wei sat down, she was still murmuring, “Jiaojiao, you’re so outstanding. I originally thought that you’d reveal your skills within the modelling industry, but I didn’t think that you’d go act in dramas and movies and be so brilliant at it.”</p> 
 <p>“What about you?” Sheng Jiaoyang retorted.</p> 
 <p>“It’s just like how you see me. I’m staying at home until I’m about to be in labor.” Wang Wei laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Before the competition ended, I didn’t even know you had a boyfriend.”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei clicked her tongue and said, “At that time, I really didn’t have one. But, after I came back, I met my husband.”</p> 
 <p>“You really get things done quickly. How many months?” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Wang Wei’s stomach.</p> 
 <p>“Exactly 20 weeks, so 5 months.”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei pulled down the zipper of her jacket until her stomach was fully exposed. She rubbed her round stomach and glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang with a happy smile, saying, “Baby, you’re so lucky. You saw two celebrities in a row!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Wang Wei’s stomach curiously and reached over to softly caress it. The swelling stomach was like a basketball full of air, a bit hard and bouncy.</p> 
 <p>“Is it tiring?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>“It’s alright. After all, I’ve had a great appetite and I can feel the baby growing daily. This makes me feel accomplished, and I'm really looking forward to the day my baby is born into the world..”</p> 
 <p>Right now, Wang Wei was revealing a motherly halo and one could tell that she was indeed living a good life.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, did you guys come here to shoot your scenes?” Besides filming, Wang Wei didn’t know any other reason that would make two celebrities come all the way to this narrow and poor place.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.”</p> 
 <p>“Can I tag along and watch?” Wang Wei asked eagerly.</p> 
 <p>“No. Our filming location is in the mountains, and it’s not suitable for you to be exhausting yourself with such a climb right now.”</p> 
 <p>“Fine.” Wang Wei seemed to be a bit disappointed before she laughed again. She was indeed very lucky to meet both Xu Jiaojiao and Gu Zhou here, and she wasn’t able to calm down because whenever she thought about it, she’d be incredibly excited.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, have you been keeping in touch with Luo Yi and the others?”</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t talked to them lately.” Though Xiao Yang had directly contacted her a few times, wanting her to come hang out. However, she was busy and she didn’t have that good of a relationship with Xiao Yang, so she’d rejected her. After that, Xiao Yang stopped contacting her.</p> 
 <p>“I follow your activities, and within the group, you’ve done the most. You’re even on the rankings amongst the currently most bankable young actresses. Jiaojiao, I told you before that you’d have a lot of accomplishments, and who knew that you’d reach that goal so quickly. It’s as if you are riding a rocket.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing Wang Wei’s blunt words, Sheng Jiaoyang just laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe!” Wang Wei suddenly shifted closer and said, “Jiaojiao, you have a boyfriend now~”</p> 
 <p>“Do you have any pictures of him? Let me take a look,” Wang Wei winked and asked eagerly.</p> 
 <p>It was hard on the eyes to see Wang Wei trying to make that expression with her chubby face.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang chuckled. Wang Wei was still as funny as ever, and she couldn’t help but pinch Wang Wei’s chubby face. “No.”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei pouted, causing her face to puff up like a steamed bun.</p> 
 <p>“If I get married one day, I’ll invite you.” Sheng Jiaoyang had enjoyed the feeling of pinching Wang Wei’s cheeks, so she pinched them again.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei didn’t even care about her actions since her attention was on Sheng Jiaoyang’s words.</p> 
 <p>“Really?” Wang Wei’s face was pinched to the point where one could only see her squinting eyes.</p> 
 <p>“No.” A smile flickered within Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei immediately felt dejected and acted like a popped balloon.</p>
