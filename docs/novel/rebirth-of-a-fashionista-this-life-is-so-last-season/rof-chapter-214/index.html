 <p>“You have to believe me, we really were just filming.”</p>
 <p>Their foreheads were touching and their breaths were mingling together. In the dark, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t make out Shen Zhining's expression.</p>
 <p>His hand brushed past her ear as he asked, “Do you remember what you promised me?”</p>
 <p><em>Promised? What promise?</em> A question mark popped up in her mind, but she didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>However, how could Shen Zhining not understand what her silence meant? If she hadn’t forgotten, then she definitely would’ve retorted.</p>
 <p>“You really did forget.” He laughed ambiguously. “Do you want me to help you remember?”</p>
 <p>“No!” she firmly refused him. <em>It definitely couldn’t be a good thing.</em></p>
 <p>“But, if I don’t help you remember, it’d be taking your promise as a fart in the wind.”</p>
 <p>“Zhining, who knew you actually spoke so vulgarly!” Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes widened. She also couldn’t see very clearly in the darkness.</p>
 <p>“Eh, is there a rule saying I can’t speak vulgarly?”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless. <em>True, was there a rule? Of course, there wasn’t.</em></p>
 <p>“Zhining, if you want to talk, then wait until after I’m done filming, alright? They’re all still waiting for me,” she could only ask nicely.</p>
 <hr>
 <details>
  <summary><strong>Show More…</strong></summary>
  <p>Shen Zhining didn’t reply. Instead, he used action to answer.</p>
  <p>His hand, which was previously on the doorknob, moved to her waist before climbing up her back.</p>
  <p>The dress she was wearing was thin, his hand separated by nothing more than a single layer of fabric. The heat of his hand permeated through the dress, making her skin tingle.</p>
  <p>Zip~</p>
  <p>The sound of her zipper opening was like a thunderclap to her ears.</p>
  <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned pale with fright as she hurriedly wrapped her arms around her stomach, holding the dress up. She was wearing a wide v-necked dress, so once the zipper was opened, it all came sliding down.</p>
  <p>“Zhining, you, you…” <em>What are you doing?!</em></p>
  <p>She didn’t get a chance to say the rest when a scene suddenly appeared in her mind.</p>
  <p>“Did you remember? Hm?” His hand moved slowly on her smooth back.</p>
  <p>“I remember!” she hastily replied.</p>
  <p>“Let’s see, what do you remember?”</p>
  <p>“…”</p>
  <p>Shen Zhining chuckled as he whispered in her ear, “If you can’t remember, then I’ll just do you here!”</p>
  <p><em>A threat! A naked threat!</em></p>
  <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to cry, but she didn’t have any tears. On the one hand, she had to fight the burning feeling on her back, and on the other, she still had to figure out what she’d promised.</p>
  <p>“Zhininggggg, can you give me a hint, just a little one,” she softly begged.</p>
  <p>He gently fondled her soft skin but remained completely indifferent to her soft and coddling words. He only spat out three words, “Think for yourself.”</p>
  <p><em>If I could remember, why would I ask you for a hint?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched. She refused to give up, using a spoiled and coquettish voice to call, “Zhining~”</p>
  <p>His hand that was originally lingering around her back suddenly slid down, slipping past her spine and landing on her soft and silky bum, suggestively giving it a squeeze.</p>
  <p>Her entire body stiffened.</p>
  <p>But, he didn’t stop as his lips grazed her neck before finally resting at the curve of her collarbone and biting down.</p>
  <p>“Sss-” she breathed out.</p>
  <p>She tried to push him but was repressed as he stuck even tighter to her.</p>
  <p>“Zhining, I’m cold.” She tried to garner some sympathy and get him to stop.</p>
  <p>“Cold?” he asked back.</p>
  <p>She hurriedly nodded and released a sound of agreement…</p>
  <p>Only to hear him laugh next to her ear. His breath tickled her ears as she heard him say, “You won’t be cold soon.”</p>
  <p>“What?” Sheng Jiaoyang was still thinking about what he’d meant when she suddenly felt her chin being tilted upwards and her lips captured in a deep, french kiss, causing her brain to melt.</p>

 <hr>
 <p>Inside the film crew’s private room, Cen Jin was pacing around, occasionally glancing at the door.</p>
 <p>“They couldn’t have already left, right?” He frowned, thinking aloud.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Zhuang, when you saw them at the door earlier, did they go down in the elevator?” he asked the stylist.</p>
 <p>“They didn’t, I saw them enter an empty private room.”</p>
 <p>Cen Jin sighed and continued, “Then, go tell them that if they have to talk, to do it after we’re done filming. There’s only two more scenes, so it’ll only take a night. There’s no need to be so clingy with each other.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll go.” Lin Yan stood up and walked to the stylist, Xiao Zhuang, to ask which room before leaving.</p>
 <p>After Lin Yan had left, the room’s atmosphere grew much more relaxed. It really was stifling earlier.</p>
 <p>“I’d thought that Mr Lin was Jiaojiao’s boyfriend!” the stylist sighed.</p>
 <p>“Everyone thought that. I was just saying how weird it was that they didn’t appear very intimate, I had assumed they were just conservative around others. Who would’ve thought that they weren’t even dating!” the stage lighting master exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“But, then again, her boyfriend’s powerful aura really does make Xu Jiaojiao look like a cute and helpless little bird in comparison,” the cameraman chimed in.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, when Jiaojiao left with her boyfriend, Mr Lin’s expression was really distressing.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no use even if you feel distressed. You’re not the one he likes.”</p>
 <p>“If it were me, I’d definitely choose somebody warm and gentle like Mr Lin. The other guy was so scary earlier that even Jiaojiao, who’s normally so aggressive, was completely swallowed up by him.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t gossip, somebody might hear,” Cen Jin said.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan, who’d followed the stylist’s directions to the room, stood in front of it, his hand frozen on the doorknob.</p>
 <p>A look of hesitation flashed across his face as he raised his hand to knock on the door.</p>
 <p>“Oh, some…body…came,” a muffled voice said from inside the room.</p>
 <p><em>It was her voice.</em></p>
 <p><em>It sounds like she’s right next to the door.</em></p>
 <p>Lin Yan lowered his eyes, his hand tightening on the doorknob.</p>
 <p>He slowly turned the doorknob. When he saw that it was unlocked, he suddenly withdrew his hand.</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, Director Cen wants me to tell you to hurry,” his tone was neutral as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Then, he stood quietly at the door. His face stayed calm as he listened to the faint sounds of movements within, but his clenched fists revealed his true mood.</p>
 <p>The door opened.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang walked out, her head lowered as she tidied up her clothes.</p>
 <p>From Lin Yan’s view, her face was flushed pink and her slightly swollen lips were eye-catching, especially the hickey left on her collarbone.</p>
 <p>However, his face was as calm as ever as he reached out to help her smooth her messy hair. When she looked at him, he acted nonchalant as he removed his hand. “Let’s go, Director Cen and the others are still waiting for us.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded and was just about to go when an arm wrapped around her waist. She turned her head and saw Shen Zhining standing behind her.</p>
 <p>“I still haven’t seen you act before, let me take a look.” Shen Zhining smiled.</p>
 <p><em>Nonsense! Last time, she was even deceived into pretending to seduce him with a nightgown!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang muttered in her mind.</p>
 <p>“What are you staring for, let’s go.” Shen Zhining tugged her forwards.</p>
 <p>Lin Yan watched the two walk away together and pursed his lips, slowly following along.</p>
 <p>The pacing Cen Jin saw them return and released a sigh of relief before immediately inhaling sharply. Xu Jiaojiao was being embraced possessively by her boyfriend and it made him feel that this scene wouldn’t go very well.</p>
 <p><em>Wait…</em> Cen Jin suddenly stared at his female lead. “Y-you two…Xiao Zhuang, come and do Jiaojiao’s makeup. Actually, nevermind, filming it like this is fine, makeup isn’t needed anymore.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt that the film crew was looking at her a little weirdly. Originally, she'd thought that it was because Shen Zhining was beside her, but then when she saw her appearance in the elevator mirror as they were headed to the film site, she suddenly understood and blushed.</p>
 <p>The next scene was already arranged and was set to be shot in the presidential suite of a nearby famous hotel.</p>
 <p>“What scene would you need to go to a hotel for?” Shen Zhining asked.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought of the scene written in the script and didn’t know how to answer.</p>
 <p>“After marriage, there’s obviously going to be an intimate scene,” Cen Jin replied casually.</p>
 <p>Shen Zhining stopped, blocking the door and almost causing the people behind to crash into him.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt strangely unconfident meeting his gaze before deciding there was nothing she should be afraid of. After all, it wasn’t her fault the script was like that.</p>
 <p>Cen Jin sensed the peculiar mood and turned to see the door being blocked and two people staring at each other.</p>
 <p>“If you guys want to show off your affection, do it at home. Jiaojiao, come here, I need to explain the key points of this next scene.” Cen Jin waved Sheng Jiaoyang over.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was just about to walk forward when Shen Zhining grabbed her shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Zhining, it’s just acting,” she said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“And if I say no?” Shen Zhining’s tone turned slightly dark.</p>
 <p>“Zhining!” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned. <em>Everybody’s watching!</em></p>
 <p>“As an up and coming popular actress, Jiaojiao will definitely have a lot of intimate scenes in the future. As her boyfriend, it’s in your best interest to learn how to adapt,” Cen Jin helpfully advised him.</p>
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded. Just when everybody thought that he wouldn’t obstruct them anymore, he turned to look at Cen Jin. “Just use a body double.”</p>
 <p>“If we are using a body double, I refuse to act this scene,” Lin Yan, who’d never spoken until now, abruptly said.</p>
 <p>A deep feeling of powerlessness rose in Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart.</p>
 <p>Cen Jin looked between them before finally staring at Sheng Jiaoyang and saying, “Jiaojiao, you decide. But, before you make your decision, I’d just like to remind you that if the scene isn’t filmed well, the entire movie won’t be successful. When A’Zhou recommended you, he placed a lot of faith in you.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was startled as she remembered how Gu Zhou had replied when she’d asked how she could thank him for his help with the advertisement.</p>
 <p><em>“Then, I’ll act as the female lead!”</em></p>
 <p>No matter what, favours must be returned. There was no way she could mess up the movie Gu Zhou had invested in and spoil all the hard work of the film crew.</p>
