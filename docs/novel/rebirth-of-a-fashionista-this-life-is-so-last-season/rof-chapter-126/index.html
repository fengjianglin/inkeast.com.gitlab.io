<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>"Mr Shen is here."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused momentarily when she heard Zeng Huan’s words. She then bade the director farewell and left.</p> 
 <p>"He’s outside?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked while walking.</p> 
 <p>"Yes, Mr Shen is waiting for you in the car."</p> 
 <p>"I'm leaving first, please take Sis Ping home." Sheng Jiaoyang noticed Shen Zhining's car, so she waved to Zeng Huan and walked up to open the car door before getting in.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining and asked, "What are you doing here?"</p> 
 <p>"Giving you a lift."</p> 
 <p>"Where are we going now?" <em>It’s only four o'clock in the afternoon, and it would take them at most an hour to get back to the Northern suburbs. If they went back so early, wouldn’t she actually need to cook dinner?</em></p> 
 <p>As this thought crossed her mind, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t wait for an answer and immediately added, "Zhining, are you free tonight? If so, then how about we go to the movies?"</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he didn’t agree nor disagree, she urged, "I heard that a few good movies came out recently. Since it's still early, why don't we go watch one?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining with an expectant look, making it hard for him to refuse.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Shen Zhining agreed in the end.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang secretly breathed a sigh of relief, only to find that she’d relaxed too early when the driver parked the car in front of a restaurant. It was the same restaurant she’d ordered food from in the past few days, and she had to admit that the dishes here were quite tasty.</p> 
 <p>She held her forehead as she thought: <em>Shen Zhining wouldn't bring her here without rhyme or reason. He must have found out about the food already…</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining got off the car and stood by the door, staring at her as he asked, "Aren’t you coming?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pursed her lips and got off as well. She sneaked a few glances at Shen Zhining's expression, but she couldn’t read him at all.</p> 
 <p>They proceeded to a private room and food was served soon after. As Sheng Jiaoyang stared at the dishes served one by one, she didn’t know what expression to use to face the man sitting opposite her.</p> 
 <p>She’d ordered all these dishes before…</p> 
 <p>"Give it a try. The food here tastes similar to the dishes you prepare at home," Shen Zhining said with a smile that wasn’t quite a smile.</p> 
 <p><em>Of course, they’d taste similar! After all, I’ve bought all my dishes from this place…</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining and felt like a mouse caught by a cat, who’d promised to let her go but didn’t. And, it was at this moment that she sadly realised she’d been fooled by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>After thinking about it, Sheng Jiaoyang decided to confess and earnestly admitted, "Actually…all the food that I’ve ‘prepared’ lately were bought from this restaurant…"</p> 
 <p>As for Shen Zhining, he simply sat there, leisurely waiting for her to turn herself in.</p> 
 <p>"I'm a terrible cook and didn’t want you to go hungry, so I ordered food from this restaurant."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded, but his expression seemed to say otherwise, as if he hadn’t believed a single word she’d said.</p> 
 <p>His aim was to warn a certain someone that he knew of all the things she did, so she better behave and stop playing tricks in the future.</p> 
 <p>After coming clean about this matter, Sheng Jiaoyang relaxed and started digging in while talking about trivial topics.</p> 
 <p>Once they’d finished dinner, the two of them leisurely walked to the nearest movie theatre in the city.</p> 
 <p>She’d initially suggested watching a movie to avoid going home early to cook dinner, but now that the matter about her ordering takeout had been exposed, there was no need for her to continue pretending. However, since she was the one who’d brought up the movies, she must stick to her plan and finish this task, no matter what.</p> 
 <p>As they walked along in the cool night breeze, Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Shen Zhining beside her. He’d inherited Andy's bloodline, so his facial features were more prominent than those of typical Easterners, and his side-profile was also very picturesque. After getting to know him during this period, Sheng Jiaoyang felt that he’d changed a lot. He was talented yet self-effacing, and his temperament was currently milder.</p> 
 <p>Before this, she never imagined that there would be a day where the two of them would go on a dinner date, go for a walk, watch a movie together, and live under the same roof, like…a couple.</p> 
 <p>When the word ‘couple’ flashed in Sheng Jiaoyang’s mind, she subconsciously held her breath for a few seconds. <em>That would be a nightmare! How boring would it be if she was in an actual relationship with Shen Zhining? If this was really the case, then her future would be bleak…</em></p> 
 <p>"Feeling cold?" Shen Zhining's voice abruptly broke her train of thought.</p> 
 <p>"Uhm, a little bit…but luckily the movie theatre is just ahead of us." Shen Zhining’s sudden concern left Sheng Jiaoyang somewhat flattered.</p> 
 <p>At the movie theatre, Sheng Jiaoyang wore a mask and went ahead to buy two tickets for the movie called ‘Memories of Our Youth’. After buying popcorn and drinks, they proceeded to the hall and sat down in the last row.</p> 
 <p>The movie started playing soon after.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang snacked on popcorn while watching.</p> 
 <p>As for Shen Zhining, he found this experience somewhat novel. This was the first time he’d sat in a movie hall to watch a film. Aside from the music and sound effects, there was the sound of a girl eating popcorn beside him. The crunching noise was very faint, but it still made his ear itch a little as if a feather lightly brushed his eardrums.</p> 
 <p>When he turned around, he saw the outline of her side profile hazily reflected amidst the dim light. The way she ate popcorn mouthful by mouthful made her appear like a little hamster having its meal and was kind of cute.</p> 
 <p>Despite the mysterious aura she carried, there was no denying that she was a likable and charming girl.</p> 
 <p>"What's wrong?" Sheng Jiaoyang felt Shen Zhining's gaze on her and asked. It was dim and she couldn’t see his expression clearly, so she wasn’t able to discern his current thoughts.</p> 
 <p>She grabbed some popcorn and was about to put it in her mouth when realisation dawned on her. She abruptly paused and glanced at the popcorn bucket in her arms before quickly passing it over to Demon King Shen, who was ‘coveting the popcorn’. “It’s quite tasty, wanna try?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining remained silent. He looked down at the popcorn bucket and heard her cheerfully say again, "It's really delicious!" As if pulled by an invisible thread, he picked up a piece of popcorn and placed it into his mouth. What followed was the sweet smell and taste of butter assaulting his senses.</p> 
 <p>Crunch.</p> 
 <p>He heard a loud sound as he ate the popcorn.</p> 
 <p>"How is it? Do you like it? I’ll put the bucket in the middle so that we can eat together!" Sheng Jiaoyang then placed the bucket in the middle of the armrest.</p> 
 <p>On the big screen, a scene appeared where the male and female lead were teasing each other with blithe and happy music echoing in the movie hall. Occasionally, girls in the movie hall would let out a cry of surprise.</p> 
 <p>Soon, love sparked between the male and female lead characters due to a variety of things they went through, and the whole scene changed from a ‘cheerful love-hate’ mode to a ‘passionate love’ mode.</p> 
 <p>The male and female lead’s PDA was excessive to the point of stirring the emotions of the couples watching the film.</p> 
 <p>In such a romantic atmosphere, a young couple sitting in front of Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining drew closer, their faces inching closer by the second…</p> 
 <p>Those sitting in the back row could clearly see what the people sitting in the front row were doing as long as they paid attention to it. Even though one couldn’t see the faces of people clearly, their actions could be discerned at a glance.</p> 
 <p>After inadvertently glancing at the couple, ripples formed in Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart. The memories that she’d thrown to the back of her mind suddenly resurfaced. That intimate scene that seemingly felt like a dream yet not a dream made her feel somewhat restless.</p> 
 <p>She reached out to grab more popcorn, but as her hand was about to reach into the popcorn bucket, it came in contact with another hand. Startled, she withdrew her hand and turned around to see Shen Zhining staring at her.</p> 
 <p>Amidst the dimly lit hall, his eyes shone like little stars in the sky.</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
