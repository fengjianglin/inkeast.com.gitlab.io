 <p><em>There was a time when I got drunk, and I forced a kiss on him? Then, I even said that I liked him?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Forcefully kissed…</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t believe her ears. There was no way she would do such a thing. </p> 
 <p><em>How much would I have to like somebody to forcefully kiss him?</em></p> 
 <p>However… with the premise of her being drunk, it was understandable. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang swallowed her saliva. “What happened after that?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining had a strange smile, “You kissed me, so naturally, you needed to take responsibility.”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>This really doesn’t sound like something Shen Zhining would say.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt like something was wrong with her ears today. </p> 
 <p>“Later, you found out that Lin Yan got engaged, so you got together with me.”</p> 
 <p>“Wait a moment… Lin Yan’s engaged? With who?” If earlier, she was just listening to the story with some shame, now, Sheng Jiaoyang’s attention was completely captured by the story.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining couldn’t help but flick her forehead. “Can you not care so much about him?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pulled back and rubbed her forehead, “Since you already mentioned it, can’t I just ask some questions about it?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised a brow and stared at her before nodding: “Alright, I’ll give you a chance and let you clarify one thing. Go ahead!”</p> 
 <p>“Then, answer the question I asked just now. Also, if he is already engaged with someone else, why is he still making moves on me?”</p> 
 <p>“His fiancée is from the Gudilesi Family. As for the reason as to why he’s still making moves on you…” Shen Zhining paused before saying, “He’s got a screw loose!” </p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang asked quietly, “Can you not joke around?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m not joking around.” Shen Zhining appeared to be very serious. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips twitched, and she definitely did not believe his last sentence. </p> 
 <p>When Shen Zhining saw the look on her face, he couldn’t help but give her a kiss. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang immediately drew back in surprise, and she leaned back against the sofa as she covered her lips and said with a muffled voice, “Just continue telling your story properly, and keep your hands to yourself.” </p> 
 <p>A trace of a smile appeared on Shen Zhining. Ever since they confirmed their feelings for each other and got into a relationship, he never got a chance to see her act shy again. He coughed after he noticed her glaring at him, and he continued, “Lin Yu is delusional, and he is always trying to get things that aren’t his. He only treasures what he lost after he finds out that it’s no longer so easily obtainable. What more can be said about such a man? Honestly, what do you even like about him?” </p> 
 <p>“His looks,” Sheng Jiaoyang said thoughtlessly. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining became speechless. He had never seen someone pursue a person for several years, just for something as superficial as his face.</p> 
 <p>He moved closer, “And what about me?”</p> 
 <p>“Do you want the truth?” </p> 
 <p>“Nevermind,” Shen Zhining stopped pursuing that line of talk, as he was afraid that her answer would be something that he did not want to hear. “Apart from looking handsome, is there anything else that made you like him so much?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang searched through her memories, and she realized that she really only fell in love with Lin Yan because of his appearance and how he looked when he played the piano.</p> 
 <p>“Who needs reasons to like somebody? Just liking them is enough. Aren’t you the same? Do you have reasons for liking me?”</p> 
 <p>“Yep.”</p> 
 <p><em>Eh?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang looked at him curiously, “What’s the reason?” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining leaned in and whispered by her ear, “Because you’re stupid.”</p> 
 <p>“…” o(╥﹏╥)o!</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stunned by his response. <em>Couldn’t they just chat properly?!</em></p> 
 <p>She was about to explode from embarrassment. She didn’t want to listen to the story anymore, so she stood up, but before she had even taken a step away, Shen Zhining grabbed her hand. With a tug, she was pulled back into his embrace.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing?” Sheng Jiaoyang glared at him. </p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say you wanted to listen to the story about our past?” A hint of a smile appeared on Shen Zhining’s lips. </p> 
 <p>“If you don’t tell the story properly, I refuse to listen to you.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised a brow and said, “Since you don’t want to listen, shall we do something else?” He looked primed and ready to kiss her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hastily raised her hand to block him. “Nevermind, continue.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining laughed. </p> 
 <p>“Don’t laugh! Just tell your story properly.” Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to cover her ears, as his laugh was just way too sexy. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining went back to retelling his story, “You and your filming crew went to the mountains to film a movie. During the filming, you guys ran into a landslide that blocked the mountain roads. Thankfully I found you guys in the nick of time, and I managed to save you all.” </p> 
 <p>“Filming a movie? Then, am I an actress now?” Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly thought back to the strange happenings at the airport. First, the flight attendant wanted to take a selfie with her. Then, strangers kept asking for her signature. At that time, she found it weird, but now that Shen Zhining told her that she went to film a movie, everything suddenly seemed to fit into place. </p> 
 <p>“To be more accurate, you’re a celebrity. You went from the modeling circle to the showbiz industry, and right after that, you even became a boss. Now, you also have another title to add to that.”</p> 
 <p>“What title?”</p> 
 <p>“A producer.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was a bit dazed. The past two years were really dramatic. In such a short amount of time, she had done so many things, and she had even fallen in love and gotten a fiance. Altogether, there were so many things that happened that she felt that it would take others 8-10 years to complete in comparison.</p> 
 <p>“Go on. What happened after you saved me?”</p> 
 <p>“You told me you were Sheng Jiaoyang, and you revealed all your secrets. After that, we became very close. We also got engaged at Lina’s and George’s wedding.”</p> 
 <p><em>Mei Niu and George got married?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang was shocked, “Isn’t Mei Niu going out with that Mr. Sven?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining just looked at her silently. He didn’t reply.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly had a bad feeling. She thought back to Lina’s earlier reaction. Dhe really didn’t seem happy. It seems that Lina didn’t get together with Sven voluntarily. </p> 
 <p>She suddenly understood, “Could it be that I got in their way when I visited Lina?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression turned grave. “No wonder Mei Niu told me not to believe what Lin Yan said. She wanted to tell me about you, but she was interrupted by them.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining narrowed his eyes. Although he didn’t reveal any emotion on her face, his heart was burning with anger. Before, he didn’t have much contact with Sven, as he believed that everybody should just mind their own business. But since Sven dared to work together with Lin Yan, he should know the consequences. </p> 
 <p>“You don’t have to worry about Lina.”</p> 
 <p>“No way! How could I not worry.” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll help you save Lina.”</p> 
 <p>“Really?”</p> 
 <p>“I always keep my promises.” </p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang heard that, she looked at him doubtfully, “In the past, you promised that you would come back to find me very soon, but you never did.” </p> 
 <p>She was talking about the distant past. Ten years ago, when Grandfather Shen came to fetch him home from her house, Shen Zhining promised that he would come back to find her very soon. However, even after she waited for him for two years, she never saw him return. When she went with her grandfather to Aureate Manor, she never saw him either. </p> 
 <p>She might’ve not remembered other things as clearly, but she had always kept that promise in mind. It was that promise that left her disappointed for a very long time. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s face stiffened as he tightened his grip on her hand, “I’ll never do that again.”</p>
