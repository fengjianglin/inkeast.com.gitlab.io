<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“He didn’t give me any reason and just asked to break up. How come he can just break up whenever he wants to?!”</p> 
 <p>“Next time you see him, give him a big slap, ok?”</p> 
 <p>“I can’t! I’ll feel guilty after I hit him.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then what do you think you should do?”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know, I don’t know! Jiaojiao, it hurts, my heart hurts…”</p> 
 <p>“Since he took the initiative to break up, you don’t need to care about him. There’ll be even better people who will love you.”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t want them, I just want George!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pulled her hair in frustration at the loudly bawling, drunk Lina who was hugging a beer bottle. Her head ached terribly.</p> 
 <p><em>That bastard, George! Just splashing a cup of wine on him was letting him off easy!</em></p> 
 <p>She’d originally thought that George would be able to treat Mei Niu well. When they’d met eyes before, she could tell that George was truly sincere towards Mei Niu. Before her accident, she even heard Mei Niu say that they wanted to go to the Aegean Sea to play. It was just half a year ago!</p> 
 <p>But, why was he suddenly courting somebody else now?</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang clutched her hair again as she watched Lina cry uncontrollably. She had no idea what to do. </p> 
 <p>Although she’d also gone through a period of crazed love, she never even managed to get into a relationship with the other, so she couldn't relate with Lina's current emotions. After all, getting what you loved then losing it was a feeling completely different from never getting it and knowing they were unattainable. </p> 
 <p>The phone left on the bar counter started ringing.</p> 
 <p>Lina probably still had a trace of reason left in her as she answered the call with hazy eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Hello?”</p> 
 <p>“Hello?”</p> 
 <p>“Hello?! Say something!”</p> 
 <p>Lina shouted at the phone.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sighed helplessly. How could the caller not be saying anything? Even she could faintly hear the voice on the other end of the phone.</p> 
 <p>She reached out and grabbed Lina’s phone, helping her answer.</p> 
 <p>“Hello!” Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?” the caller asked in English after hearing an unfamiliar voice.</p> 
 <p>Lina was still crying hysterically and creating a lot of noise. So, although Sheng Jiaoyang could hear what the other said, his voice wasn't clear at all. </p> 
 <p>“I’m Lina’s friend. She’s currently drunk, so it’s not convenient for her to answer the phone. What are you calling her for? I’ll tell her once she’s sober.”</p> 
 <p>“Where are you guys?”</p> 
 <p>“Lina’s house.”</p> 
 <p>“Is anybody else there apart from you and Nana?” the person asked.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought this was strange and looked down to see the caller ID. Lina had saved the caller's contact under the name ‘Bastard 2’, making Sheng Jiaoyang speechless. However, if Lina had saved them under such a name, she was probably pretty close with them. Sheng Jiaoyang pondered before replying, "Nope." </p> 
 <p>“Please take good care of Nana.”</p> 
 <p>Not many people called Lina ‘Nana’. Sheng Jiaoyang still wanted to know who the caller was when the other party unexpectedly said, “Goodbye!” Then, they hung up.</p> 
 <p>“George, how could you say I don’t love you! If I didn’t love you, why would I feel so sad now? George…”</p> 
 <p>The drunkard was still hugging her beer bottle and sobbing.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sighed again. She really wasn’t good with emotions. Everything depended on Mei Niu herself.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>The next day.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes, Lina was nowhere to be seen. Once she was fully awake, she left the bedroom to find Lina scurrying around busily in the kitchen. </p> 
 <p>"Morning, Little Sun!" Lina greeted Sheng Jiaoyang with a smile, showing her mood wasn't bad. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang leaned on the counter and inspected Lina. Today's Mei Niu looked very different. She’d specially applied her makeup and ironed her clothes so there were no wrinkles. With her current appearance, it was impossible to imagine that she was the same noisy, heartbroken, bitterly crying woman from last night. Instead, she resembled somebody who’d just fallen in love, with boundless vitality and energy. </p> 
 <p>"It's really been a long time since I’ve eaten breakfast made by you." Sheng Jiaoyang thought back.</p> 
 <p>"Hurry and wash up. We'll be late if we wait any longer."</p> 
 <p>"Yeah."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled, turning to brush her teeth and wash her face.</p> 
 <p>Speaking of that, although Lina never hid her violent temperament in front of Sheng Jiaoyang, her cooking skills were really amazing. It was light years apart from Sheng Jiaoyang's own muddled cooking. </p> 
 <p>As they ate breakfast together, neither one brought up yesterday night's drinking.</p> 
 <p>The two were washing the dishes together when they heard the doorbell ring. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Lina. <em>Who would come to her house so early? Was it her assistant?</em></p> 
 <p>Lina also looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, using her eyes to tell the other that there was no way it was her assistant. </p> 
 <p>"I'll go open the door." Lina took off her dishwashing gloves and went to open the door. </p> 
 <p>Lina opened the door a crack and saw who it was before abruptly slamming the door shut. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>What happened? Don't tell her that it was George?</em></p> 
 <p>While Sheng Jiaoyang was making guesses inside her head, a shout sounded from the other side of the door. </p> 
 <p>"Nana, open the door!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang finally knew why Lina had slammed the door shut and looked at her just now. </p> 
 <p>The one outside was Lin Yan. </p> 
 <p>Lina naturally knew about her liking Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>"Open the door," Sheng Jiaoyang said. Now she realised who’d called last night. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan cared for his little sister, Lina, even more than Aunt Lin did. With how out of control Lina was on the phone last night, it would be normal for him to rush here early in the morning to check up on her. </p> 
 <p>Lina anxiously looked at Sheng Jiaoyang as she opened the door. </p> 
 <p>Upon entering, the first thing Lin Yan did was examine the room, pausing when he noticed Sheng Jiaoyang washing the dishes.</p> 
 <p>Lina moved in front of her, blocking Sheng Jiaoyang from Lin Yan's gaze. She asked bluntly, “Why'd you come?" </p> 
 <p>"To check up on you," Lin Yan replied calmly. </p> 
 <p>"I'm good, there's nothing for you to check." Lina wasn't happy. </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan didn't care at all about Lina's nasty temper, softly pushing her aside and entering the kitchen.</p> 
 <p>Lina's expression changed before she recalled that Little Sun had become a different person, so there wouldn't be anything to worry about. </p> 
 <p>"Thank you for taking care of Lina last night," Lin Yan stood ramrod straight as he said to Sheng Jiaoyang's back while she washed the dishes. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang finally finished washing the dishes and took off the dishwashing gloves, turning to face Lin Yan in a speed neither fast or slow. </p> 
 <p>The man in front of her was as refined and handsome as ever, always giving her the urge to draw him. His graceful features carried a sense of alienation within them, making him feel utterly unapproachable. Before, she’d the best circumstances and conditions, but was still unable to make him hers. Now, although she still liked him, she’d already experienced the twists and turns of her love, and that feeling of wanting to chase him no matter what had been quietly suppressed. </p> 
 <p>"There's no need for thanks, taking care of Mei Niu is my responsibility." </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan's expression changed slightly as he turned to look at Lina. In the past, up until now, there's only ever been one person that called Lina ‘Mei Niu’.</p> 
 <p>Lina could tell what Lin Yan was thinking with a glance. She saw that Sheng Jiaoyang could face Lin Yan calmly and suddenly thought of something. "Right, Jiaojiao and I are bosom buddies!" </p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao?" Lin Yan's gaze turned cold.</p> 
 <p>"Yeah, I forgot to introduce you. She's called Xu Jiaojiao, my soul sister!" Lina looked at Lin Yan and smiled evilly.</p> 
 <p>"How come I’ve never seen her before?"</p> 
 <p>"Of course, you haven't seen her before. Jiaojiao and I felt like old friends at first glance." </p> 
 <p>Lin Yan just nodded and didn't look at Sheng Jiaoyang again. He asked Lina, "What happened last night?"</p> 
 <p>"What do you mean, what happened? Last night, Jiaojiao and I met up and drank some alcohol. What else could've happened?" </p> 
 <p>Lina saw that Lin Yan still wanted to say something and said first, "What else do you want here? I still need to take Jiaojiao back to the television group."</p> 
 <p>"I'll send you guys."</p> 
 <p>"No need, we'll leave first. Remember to help me close the door." Lina grabbed Sheng Jiaoyang's hand and picked up her bag.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at Lin Yan when she left, only to meet his scrutinising gaze.</p> 
 <p>She lowered her eyes and left with Lina. </p>
