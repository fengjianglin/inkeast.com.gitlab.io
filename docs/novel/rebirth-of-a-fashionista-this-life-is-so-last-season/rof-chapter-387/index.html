 <p>“Who are we meeting?”</p> 
 <p>They’ve been waiting in the car for a while now, but nobody showed up, so Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but ask again. </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining just sat there calmly. </p> 
 <p>“No rush, you’ll see.”</p> 
 <p>“I can wait, but you should tell me who we’re meeting first.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining reached out to hold her hand. “Before meeting them, shouldn’t you give me an explanation first?” </p> 
 <p>“Explanation for what?” Sheng Jiaoyang looked confused.</p> 
 <p>“I heard Lin Yan came over,” Shen Zhining said casually. </p> 
 <p>“Yeah, he came by,” Sheng Jiaoyang also responded in a casual manner.</p> 
 <p>Soon after she said those words casually, the car became awkwardly silent. Shen Zhining refused to speak, and Sheng Jiaoyang could sense his unhappiness. </p> 
 <p>She moved her gaze away from the window and turned to look at Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>She found that Shen Zhining was also looking at her, but she could not discern his feelings from the look on his face. </p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>“What did he say to you?”</p> 
 <p>“He…”</p> 
 <p><em>Knock knock knock.</em> Somebody knocked on the car window, and interrupted Sheng Jiaoyang before she could finish what she wanted to say.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining gave Sheng Jiaoyang a final glance before shouting out to the person, “Come in!” </p> 
 <p>The chauffeur opened the door, and somebody entered. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked over and called out in surprise, “Mei Niu!” </p> 
 <p>That’s right, the one who had just entered the car was her closest friend, Lina. </p> 
 <p>Lina took a seat and smiled at Sheng Jiaoyang first before looking at Shen Zhining, “Thank you! I am really grateful for your help. ” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded and bluntly accepted Lina’s thanks. Although he didn’t rescue Lina out of the kindness of his heart, it still took a lot of effort for him to rescue Lina from Sven. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining, and her eyes were sparkling with appreciation and adoration. When Shen Zhining said that he would help Lina escape, she believed him, but she thought that it would take a long time. She didn’t expect him to be able to rescue Lina right away.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go back home first.”</p> 
 <p>Lina inspected Sheng Jiaoyang, and she suddenly asked her, “Jiaojiao, have some of your memories recovered?”</p> 
 <p>“Not yet, but Lin Yan said that my memory loss is only temporary, and that it’ll return slowly.”</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang was answering Lina’s question, her attention was fully focused on her, and she didn’t notice the change in Shen Zhining’s expression.</p> 
 <p>However, since Lina was sitting across the both of them, she managed to notice his rapidly souring face. She looked meaningfully at Sheng Jiaoyang. </p> 
 <p>Thankfully, Sheng Jiaoyang understood Lina’s signal, and she turned to look at Shen Zhining. She saw that Shen Zhining’s face was extremely dark, but she didn’t know why. So, she gave Lina a confused glance, and used her eyes to ask: <em>What’s he so mad about this time?</em></p> 
 <p>Lina coughed gently and changed the topic, “How have you guys been doing?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m filming a movie.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I know. You told me about it. It’s the one based on your parents, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, we’ve just started.”</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere turned more and more awkward, mostly because a certain person kept releasing an aura that was clearly screaming that he was not happy. Sheng Jiaoyang thought for a moment, before she took the initiative to speak with Shen Zhining, “Zhining, how did you save Lina? I remember that Sven’s domain was heavily monitored, and that there were guards everywhere.” </p> 
 <p>“I said I wanted to go back to see my mother. Sven was busy with something, so he just called his people to escort me. This gave Mr. Shen’s people an opportunity to help me escape.”</p> 
 <p>“That means you guys managed to get in contact beforehand? Otherwise, how would his people know when to act?”</p> 
 <p>“My people were always stationed nearby, and they had always been waiting for a chance,” Shen Zhining said. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought back to his tantrum earlier, and she quickly sprinkled in a few words of flattery. “Zhining, you’re so amazing! If you weren’t so prepared, Lina would’ve still been trapped.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s furrowed brows became much smoother, and he no longer seemed so unhappy.</p> 
 <p>Lina looked at those two, before she laughed to herself and leaned back on her seat.</p> 
 <p>When they arrived back home, Lina had already fallen into a deep sleep.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was still able to joke with Lina as she woke her up, “Since when did you become so weak? You even fell into such a deep sleep when riding in the car.” </p> 
 <p>Lina smiled, but she didn’t explain herself.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang wasn’t surprised to see Lina. Instead, he welcomed her enthusiastically. </p> 
 <p>They had a meal together before Sheng Jiaoyang pulled Lina into her room.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry, Mei Niu. I didn’t know about your situation last time, and I almost thought that you and Sven were a couple.” Sheng Jiaoyang held Lina’s hand and sat on the bed with her. </p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, I’m already free from him anyway.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang saw how tired Lina looked and decided to stop speaking. In any case, they had plenty of time together, and Lina was definitely tired after sitting in the airplane for so many hours.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll go run the water for you so you can take a bath and sleep first. Rest up, we can chat in the morning.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Na just smiled at her.</p> 
 <p>After filling the bathtub with water and setting some pyjamas and new underwear beside it, Sheng Jiaoyang called Lina over before leaving the bathroom. </p> 
 <p>She still had some stuff she wanted to ask Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>But when she went downstairs, she discovered that Shen Zhining wasn’t there. She asked around and found out that he had already gone back to his place to rest. She hesitated for a moment before deciding to go over and find Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>Between the two mansions, there wasn’t even a locked door, so she was able to simply walk her way into Shen Zhining’s place.</p> 
 <p>When Felix opened the door and saw that it was her, he immediately told her where Shen Zhining was, even before she asked, “Boss is in his room.”</p> 
 <p>Just as Sheng Jiaoyang was about to turn around and leave, Felix quickly added, “You should go and check up on him. Boss’ mood doesn’t seem very good today.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang paused and thought back to the happenings of the day. Other than the time when Lina reminded her about Shen Zhining’s mood, she had never really given him much attention. </p> 
 <p>As his girlfriend, it really wasn’t appropriate to act like that.</p> 
 <p>After she had such thoughts, Sheng Jiaoyang started to walk up to Shen Zhining’s room. However, she stopped just after a few steps. </p> 
 <p>“Felix, can you show me to his room?” She has never come here since she returned, so she didn’t know which room was Shen Zhining’s. </p> 
 <p>Felix glanced at her, but he didn’t say anything, and simply led her to his room.</p> 
 <p>When they reached his door, he knocked on it before reporting to his boss, “Boss, Miss Xu’s here.”</p> 
 <p>After a silent moment, the door opened and Shen Zhining walked out, droplets of water still on his body.</p> 
 <p>His gaze immediately fell onto Sheng Jiaoyang, and he ignored Felix entirely.</p> 
 <p>Felix left discreetly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s gaze couldn’t help but wander to the small opening in the bathrobe. </p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a burst of fragrance hit her nose as she fell into his embrace.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at?” His deep voice held a smile as he whispered in her ear. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang met his suggestive gaze and blinked, “Nothing.” </p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s lips curved up as he turned and went back to his room, “Come in.”</p> 
 <p>“I wanted to ask you something. Would Sven know that Lina came here? If…” Sheng Jiaoyang talked as she followed him in. However, her voice abruptly stopped, and she stiffened at the sight before her.</p> 
 <p>The man in front of her had just taken off his robe, revealing his lean and powerful figure, as well as…</p>
