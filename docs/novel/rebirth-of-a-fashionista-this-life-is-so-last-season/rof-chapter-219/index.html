 <p>Late at night, Sheng Jiaoyang was woken up by her phone ringing.</p> 
 <p>She flipped over and grabbed her phone. When she saw that Lin Yan’s name was on the caller ID, she instantly sobered up.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan?” she answered the phone and asked doubtfully.</p> 
 <p>Last night, everybody had played until very late. She ended up staying with the film crew in the hotel for the night. Tomorrow, she planned to continue staying with the film crew to finish shooting.</p> 
 <p>She glanced at the time and saw that it wasn’t even 5 AM. Usually, Lin Yan would never call so early and bother her.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t want to call and bother your rest, but you would’ve already left to finish filming in the morning.” Lin Yan’s voice sounded slightly low and hoarse, with a trace of frustration.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, are you alright?” Sheng Jiaoyang sat up.</p> 
 <p>“I’m a bit dizzy, but it’s not urgent. I just wanted to talk to you about something.”</p> 
 <p>His voice sounded powerless; clearly, something was wrong.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned. “Lin Yan, do you have a fever? Feel your forehead, is it hot?”</p> 
 <p>“I can’t feel…it’s nothing, don’t worry about me…”</p> 
 <p>“How could I not worry?” Sheng Jiaoyang got up from the bed. “Lin Yan, give me a moment, I’ll change and come over.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t-”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had already hung up as she quickly changed and went to Lin Yan’s door.</p> 
 <p>She pressed the doorbell.</p> 
 <p>After the door rang, a muffled ‘thump!’ sounded as if somebody had fallen to the floor. Sheng Jiaoyang’s heart thumped as she waited anxiously, wishing she could just break open the door.</p> 
 <p>It took a while, but the door finally opened.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan!”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan supported himself on the door frame, his face abnormally pale with a red flush. He seemed completely powerless as if he could fall down at any time.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly supported him and reached out to feel his forehead. His temperature scared her as she quickly helped him back to his bed.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, lie down first and I’ll help you call a doctor.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan pulled her hand. “Ben already went to get somebody, can you stay and talk with me?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt her heart hurting as she looked at his thin and haggard appearance. <em>Just a few hours ago he was completely fine. How could he have already become like this?!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sat on the bed and touched his forehead again, frowning slightly, “Weren’t you just fine yesterday?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s probably because I stayed in my bath for too long,” Lin Yan replied weakly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt helpless. “You’re already so old, yet you still can’t take care of yourself.”</p> 
 <p>“The past few days have been pretty tiring, so I wasn’t careful and fell asleep.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt a trace of guilt. If it weren’t for her, Lin Yan wouldn’t have taken the role.</p> 
 <p>Those who’ve never acted before would never understand how bitter it was. The mountains were cold, but none of the actors could wear much clothes or they wouldn’t appear nicely on camera. Furthermore, there were times when they skipped through scenes into the summer ones. At those times, even though it was winter, they had to wear short sleeves to film.</p> 
 <p>There were also times where the scene had to be filmed over and over again in order to appear as perfect as possible to the audience.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan had always lived like a prince, but during the time they spent filming, the adjective ‘tired’ wouldn’t be enough to describe it. Still though, he acted like it was nothing, eating what everybody else ate. Because he never revealed his tiredness, she’d forgotten that he’d never experienced such exhaustion before.</p> 
 <p>“I’m sorry,” she apologised.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan gripped her hand and smiled at her, his pale, bloodless lips making him appear sickly. “You don’t have to apologise to me, I was willing to do all of it. It makes me happy to do this with you, it’s just a pity chances like these are too little.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t talk, I’ll get a wet towel to lower your temperature.” Sheng Jiaoyang took back her hand and quickly walked to the bathroom.</p> 
 <p>She placed the wet towel on his forehead, growing increasingly worried as she kept glancing at the door.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, don’t be worried, they’ll come soon.”</p> 
 <p>“How could I not be worried, are you sure your bodyguard went to get somebody? It’s been so long, why hasn’t he come back yet?” Sheng Jiaoyang even had the urge to go down and see for herself.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan grabbed her hand again and comforted her. “I’ll be fine if you’re here.”</p> 
 <p>Just at that moment, they heard the door open and footsteps walk towards them.</p> 
 <p>Very soon, three figures appeared.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded to Lin Yu standing behind the bodyguard before turning to the man with a medicinal trunk at the back. “Doctor, please hurry. His fever’s very serious.” She wanted to get up to make way, but Lin Yan didn’t release her hand.</p> 
 <p>The bodyguard stepped aside and Lin Yu also made way as the doctor walked to the bed. He swiftly laid out his supplies on the bedside cabinet and took out a thermometer.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, I have to step aside and let the doctor examine you. Loosen your hand,” Sheng Jiaoyang said gently.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan pursed his lips and stared at her, refusing to let go.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not leaving, I’ll wait until you get better.” Sheng Jiaoyang consoled him.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan finally let go.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly gave way to the doctor and watched him inspect Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>The doctor took Lin Yan’s temperature and tested him for allergies before injecting him with medicine to reduce the fever.</p> 
 <p>“My preliminary conclusion is that this is a fever caused by a cold. However, his body temperature is too high and I’m not sure if there are any other causes. It’s best to send him to a hospital for a proper diagnosis,” the doctor said to Lin Yu.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, then let’s hurry and send him to the hospital,” Lin Yu agreed.</p> 
 <p>He was just about to ask Lin Yan’s bodyguard to help support him, but Sheng Jiaoyang was faster and had already spoken with the bodyguard until he understood what she wanted.</p> 
 <p>The strong and sturdy bodyguard then carried Lin Yan on his back and walked to the door.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly grabbed a coat from the rack and went with them, followed by Lin Yu and the doctor with his medicinal trunk.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stuck closely with the bodyguard and pulled at the coat, making sure it didn’t fall from Lin Yan’s body. When they got into the car, she also sat beside him, constantly checking his temperature.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s fever was pretty serious. Even after the fever relieving shot, his body temperature still didn’t go down. Although he was conscious, he was confused by the fever and clung to Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand tightly.</p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the hospital, Lin Yan was carried into the emergency room. Only after Sheng Jiaoyang had promised three times that she wouldn’t leave did he finally let go of her.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu observed all of this. He looked at her anxiously pacing by the emergency room doors and hesitated. “You and my cousin…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to look at him, not knowing how to reply.</p> 
 <p>“You guys weren’t this…intimate before. When did this happen? I’m sorry, it was rude of me to ask, but I couldn’t help it,” Lin Yu said apologetically.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine.” Sheng Jiaoyang hesitated for a moment. “Lin Yan and I have known each other for a long time now,” she could only explain that much.</p> 
 <p><em>For a long time now…</em> A flicker of doubt flashed through Lin Yu’s eyes. He remembered that when he saw her at his aunt’s house last time, his cousin didn’t react.</p> 
 <p>“I thought that you and Mr Shen were a couple,” Lin Yu said.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lashes trembled upon being reminded that Shen Zhining and her were still dating. When she thought about how she’d spent the entire afternoon yesterday waiting for Shen Zhining, but still didn’t see him, she felt a rush of anger. Although his anger was reasonable, she refused to accept his cold behaviour.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, Shen Zhining’s my boyfriend,” she acknowledged. It wasn’t like it was something bad, the truth was the truth.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu stared at her in astonishment. “Then, you and my cousin…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the ceiling and sighed before turning to the emergency room door. Her expression changed quite a few times before she mumbled quietly, “I don’t know. I need to calm down and think about what I want.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu raised his hand and gently patted her back, comforting her. “It doesn’t matter what you choose as long as you're happy.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Lin Yu, a complicated expression on her face. <em>This man always treats everyone with such kindness. With him as a friend, you’d never have to worry if he’d ever backstab you. It’s no wonder that although Yuan Neng, Yan Anxuan, and the others weren’t in the same field as him, they sincerely treated him like a friend.</em></p> 
 <p>She used to think that she wouldn’t feel any regret after using him to get back at Sheng Shiyun, but now, she felt a twinge of guilt. He hadn’t done anything wrong, yet he was exploited by her.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” Lin Yu felt her complicated gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yu, I also wish you happiness,” she said sincerely.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu revealed a warm smile. “Thank you!”</p> 
 <p>“Although I can’t comment on the topic of love, I’ll try my best to achieve happiness in other areas,” he said.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang fell silent, her emotions stirring. However, she couldn’t do anything as she’d rather let Lin Yu believe that she was dead. That way, he could slowly get over it and one day, achieve a pure and true love.</p> 
 <p>“If you’d let me say this, I truly hope you can consider being with my cousin. Ever since I’ve known him, I’ve never seen him act so emotional towards anybody. It looks like he sincerely likes you, or rather, loves you. But, I also think that you’re good together with Mr Shen. He doesn’t seem to be a very approachable person, yet he always looks at you warmly.” Lin Yu turned the topic back to her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t help but smile. “You haven’t given me any new suggestions with all this talking back and forth.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu also smiled in response. “Of course. When it comes to love, outsiders have no right to interfere. As your friend, I can only say that I wish for you to follow your heart and choose somebody that you won’t regret.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at him and suddenly stepped forward, reaching out to hug him.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, Lin Yu.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu gently patted her back. “You don’t have to be polite.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stepped back and smiled at him, jokingly saying, “To repay you, I’ll definitely introduce you to a cute girl some time.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu laughed helplessly.</p>
