 <p>Lina froze when she saw George.</p> 
 <p>The smile on Sven's face disappeared, and darkness flashed across his eyes. He looked at Lina and tightened his grasp on her hand.</p> 
 <p>Lina recovered her senses and turned to look at Sven. Their eyes met for a few seconds.</p> 
 <p>"Lina—" George shouted from the other end of the red carpet.</p> 
 <p>"Darling." A smile reappeared on Sven's face, but there was no hint of a smile in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>On one side was the true love that encompassed her youth and feelings of the past few years, and on the other was the father of her son that she couldn’t break away from.</p> 
 <p>Lina lowered her eyes expressionlessly.</p> 
 <p>The guests who came to the wedding reception were basically people with status and experience, so they understood at a glance what was going on. They watched the scene from the sidelines and couldn’t help but whisper amongst themselves.</p> 
 <p>All kinds of expressions were seen on the faces of the Gudilesi family members. Some were gloating, some appeared solemn, and some looked anxious.</p> 
 <p>Family Head Bruno, who was sitting next to Family Head Gudilesi, narrowed his eyes at the sight. He then smiled at Family Head Gudilesi and said, "Everyone likes good quality items."</p> 
 <p>Family Head Gudilesi picked up his wine glass and made a toast, "The same can be said for outstanding women."</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, security guards had already gone up and tried to take George away, but they were dismissed by Sven.</p> 
 <p>Lina looked up at Sven.</p> 
 <p>Sven held her hand up and kissed it gently. He flashed her a smile and said, "Darling, you can call the shots."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was standing at one side with the box of rings in her hand as she quietly watched this scene unfold in a calm manner. No matter what choice Lina made, her only task was to support Lina’s decision and accompany her.</p> 
 <p>Unexpectedly, she caught a glimpse of Sven’s best man, who was standing on the opposite side of Sven, winking and making signs at her. When he saw her look over in his direction, he started to wink at her again. Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips twitched at the sight, and she looked away in an unperturbed manner.</p> 
 <p>This person had neither Lin Yan's delicate and handsome appearance, nor Shen Zhining's dazzling aura, so he was not her type at all. However, the other party wasn’t aware of this, and kept trying to hook up with her.</p> 
 <p>Now that the security guards were not blocking his path, George made his way towards Lina.</p> 
 <p>Lina turned to look at George.</p> 
 <p>"Lina." The unkempt mustache on George’s face made him appear somewhat desolate. However, he still looked at her affectionately, "I'm sorry."</p> 
 <p>His voice trembled slightly, and a profound sense of remorse could be heard from it.</p> 
 <p>"You found out?" Lina asked.</p> 
 <p>The rim of George's eyes were reddened, "Yes, I know everything now. I…" He choked on his emotions, and remorse and pain was clearly visible on his face.</p> 
 <p>Lina turned to look at Sven. She found it suspicious that George could find out the truth so soon, and she suspected that Sven must have had a hand in this. Otherwise, if Sven wanted to hide the truth, then George couldn’t have possibly found out about it based on his current abilities.</p> 
 <p>"Lina, will you forgive me?"</p> 
 <p>Lina smiled faintly, "I have never blamed you, so what’s there to forgive you for?"</p> 
 <p>George's eyes widened with surprise.</p> 
 <p>Sven's brow twitched slightly. Although the scene in front of him was a bit of an eyesore, he didn’t interrupt them, and simply stood there with a calm expression.</p> 
 <p>"Lina, leave with me. Let's start over." George stretched his hand out to Lina.</p> 
 <p>Lina lowered her eyes, and her gaze became fixated on George's hands.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere quieted down. The people who were whispering earlier listened attentively, waiting for her to make a decision.</p> 
 <p>When George saw that Lina didn’t move, he became nervous and called out again, "Lina."</p> 
 <p>Lina looked up at George. Her red lips parted slightly, and she replied calmly, "George, there is no turning back."</p> 
 <p>George’s expression froze and he was like a punctured balloon that crumbled. </p> 
 <p>At the same time, Sven obviously looked more relaxed, and a smile leaked out uncontrollably from the corner of his eye.</p> 
 <p>"Let go of the past, George. You can find someone better." Lina appeared very calm. Only her clenched fists revealed some of her true emotions.</p> 
 <p>"One last question," George took a deep breath and pointed at Sven. "Do you love him?"</p> 
 <p>The smile on Sven's face dimmed. He didn’t expect George to ask such a sharp question. It was a question that even he didn’t dare to ask, because he already knew what the answer was.</p> 
 <p>Instead of looking at Sven, Lina raised her chin and looked George in the eye. She then calmly replied, "Of course."</p> 
 <p>George's shoulder drooped. He closed his eyes to hold back the pain in his heart.</p> 
 <p>Lina's lips trembled slightly. She wanted to tell George that there were many things in the world that couldn’t be braced by feelings alone. Just like the two of them. They were deeply in love with each other, but what happened in the end? It ended up hurting even more, because they loved each other.</p> 
 <p>After taking a few deep breaths, George opened his eyes and said, "I wish you happiness." He then turned around to leave. After taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at Sven, who was smiling like a winner, and said loudly, "Lina, I will wait for you. If he doesn't treat you well, you can come back to me."</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, George strode away.</p> 
 <p>While Lina was staring at George's retreating back, Sven grabbed her hand and whispered next to her ear, "It's a pity, but it seems that he will be going to heaven alone."</p> 
 <p>Lina turned around, and her eyes met Sven’s deep gaze. His fiery gaze was very ardent, unlike his normal self.</p> 
 <p>Sven had two contradictory sides to him. Sometimes, he seemed like a prodigal son from the modern times, and sometimes he acted like an aristocrat from the medieval times. Thus, he was always hard to read, and she didn’t know which side was the real him.</p> 
 <p>Lina smiled, and the light in the hall shone on her. Coupled with today's makeup, she looked particularly beautiful.</p> 
 <p>Sven flashed her a smile as well.</p> 
 <p>Everyone at the scene, intentionally or unintentionally, followed along and smiled.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, who was standing on the side, announced, "May the bride and groom exchange their rings." </p> 
 <p>Sven took the ring from his best man's hand and, under everyone's gaze, he knelt down on one knee in front of Lina. He extended his right hand to Lina, and stopped it mid-air.</p> 
 <p>Lina’s smile dimmed slightly as she stared at Sven's hand. She didn’t move.</p> 
 <p>Sven's eyelids twitched. Lina’s gaze reminded him of the earlier scene, in which Lina stared at George's outstretched hand with the exact same heavy expression.</p> 
 <p>"I don't need your wealth and status, and I don't need your help and support. I just need a little space and freedom. Are you willing to give me that?" Lina looked at Sven calmly.</p> 
 <p>Sven's movements remained the same, and he revealed a genuine smile, "Of course, as long as you are mine."</p> 
 <p>Lina closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She then slowly opened her eyes and placed her white gloved hand on the palm of Sven's hand.</p> 
 <p>Sven smiled brightly, and he firmly put the ring on Lina's ring finger.</p> 
 <p>The crowd erupted into cheers.</p> 
 <p>The best man also howled with delight.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the best man, and a trace of disdain flitted across her eyes. She couldn’t quite understand how a shrewd and profound person like Sven would have such a straightforward friend. Normally, birds of a feather flock together.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao." Lina held out her hand towards her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened the ring box and handed it over.</p> 
 <p>Because she lost her memories, she felt that this was the first time she had given someone a ring, and this person was also her best friend, so she got more emotional than usual.</p> 
 <p>She watched as Lina took the ring and slowly put it on Sven's ring finger. She then saw Sven stand up, embrace Lina, and kissed her. Watching this scene unfold, she felt indescribably touched.</p> 
 <p>She wasn’t only moved by Lina. She also felt that marriage didn’t seem as worrisome as she thought.</p> 
 <p>"I’m so moved! Sven finally got married."</p> 
 <p>While Sheng Jiaoyang was experiencing this touching moment quietly, a voice suddenly sounded next to her ear.</p> 
 <p>She turned around and saw the best man pulling at a strand of his hair and winking at her.</p> 
 <p>"Is there sand in your eyes?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked in Italian.</p> 
 <p>The best man was stupefied momentarily. He then blinked innocently and replied in Italian, "Yes, do you want to blow the sand away for me?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed. "I don't think you have sand in your eyes, but you must be ill!"</p> 
 <p>"Yes, I'm ill because of you. I'm ill here," the best man replied in an exaggerated manner while clutching his chest.</p> 
 <p>Since Sven was standing nearby, he heard his best man's words. He turned his head and glanced at his best man. "Jerry, she's not someone you could flirt with." </p> 
 <p>"Why not?" Jerry asked gleefully.</p> 
 <p>"Because I'm afraid that you won't be able to see tomorrow’s sun if you did." Sheng Jiaoyang flashed an evil smile.</p> 
 <p>Some people just liked to court disasters, and the more others warned them, the more they wanted to take action.</p> 
 <p>In the leisure time after the banquet, Jerry kept pestering Sheng Jiaoyang. He followed her with a glass of wine, saying that he must have a few drinks with her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang went to see Sven, but Sven had already gone to check on Sweit with Lina. She called Lina and asked her to give the phone to Sven.</p> 
 <p>"What's the matter?" Sven asked.</p> 
 <p>"Can I hit your best man?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked with clenched teeth.</p> 
 <p>Sven smiled, but he replied truthfully, "Although I'd love to see that kid get beaten up, it's obvious that you’re not his match. He has learned mixed martial arts, and he’s a famous expert in our circle."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took a deep breath, "I'm very curious, how did he end up as your best man?"</p> 
 <p>"Probably because he got lucky."</p> 
 <p>"What?"</p> 
 <p>"The best man was decided by drawing lots, and Jerry won."</p> 
 <p>"…" Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p>"Dear Jiao, what are you doing here? Didn't you say you had to go to the bathroom?" Jerry’s annoying voice sounded from behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang extended her hand and used her cell phone to stop Jerry from getting close to her.</p> 
 <p>"Jerry, do you know what you look like right now?" Sheng Jiaoyang clenched her teeth and asked.</p> 
 <p>"Like what?" Jerry blinked.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang put on a fake smile and stated word by word, "A. Bum. Beetle!"</p> 
 <p>"What is that?" Jerry asked, bewildered.</p> 
 <p>"if you don't understand, you could ask the translator." Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and left.</p> 
 <p>After a while, Sheng Jiaoyang thought that she had finally gotten rid of the bum beetle. However, a certain thick-skinned person unexpectedly appeared again.</p> 
 <p>"Dear Jiao, I've already asked someone."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stopped what she was doing and looked up at Jerry.</p> 
 <p>Jerry grinned. "I didn't expect that I'd be so cute in your eyes."</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>"Do you even know what I was talking about?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked with a questioning gaze.</p> 
 <p>"My multilingual friend said that you were talking about a small clingy creature."</p> 
 <p><em>There’s nothing wrong with the translation, but something is wrong with Jerry’s head for sure!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang narrowed her eyes. "Why did you assume that the creature is cute?"</p> 
 <p>Jerry blinked. "What, it isn’t cute?"</p> 
 <p>Just as Sheng Jiaoyang almost couldn’t restrain herself from throwing that glass of wine on Jerry, a man with a gentle smile appeared.</p>
