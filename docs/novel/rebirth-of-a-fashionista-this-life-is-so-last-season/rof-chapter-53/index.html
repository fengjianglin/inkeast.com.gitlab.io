<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>In fact, it wasn’t that difficult to take pictures with the theme of environmental protection. As long as the picture was about environmental protection, then it was fine. Although the theme wasn’t challenging, it was very difficult to take good pictures.</p> 
 <p>In particular, it was even more difficult to invite a foreigner to partake in the photoshoot. The first thing to overcome was the language barrier. If they didn’t know the language, how could they communicate their thoughts? Without proper communication, how could they have a tacit understanding of how to pose in order to take a good picture?</p> 
 <p>So, when the judges saw a bunch of photos containing various shortcomings, they weren’t surprised at all. What surprised them were the two good photos. No, the way the two photos were taken couldn’t just be described as good. They were, in fact, exceptional photos.</p> 
 <p>When it was time for the evaluation, the other five contestants were singled out by the judges. Amongst them, there was a judge with a venomous tongue who wasn’t stingy with his criticism at all, and most of the contestants were criticised without disparity.</p> 
 <p>When Wang Wei walked in, the judges, who were discussing whether language was an important factor or not, stopped talking.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that the people who participated in your photoshoot were invited by Xu Jiaojiao?” </p> 
 <p>Wang Wei nervously nodded, fearing that the judges wouldn’t approve of this conduct.</p> 
 <p>“You must’ve saved Xu Jiaojiao in your past life. She’s done you a great favour this time,” the judge with the venomous tongue commented.</p> 
 <p>“The image and idea portrayed in this photo are quite good. If I have to mention a flaw, it would be your expression. When you glanced back at the elderly woman while she bent down to pick up the water bottle, your surprised expression seemed too deliberate and not very natural.”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei repeatedly nodded.</p> 
 <p>“In short, the overall concept and content of the photo are okay, so congratulations Wang Wei, you’ve passed this round.”</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, thank you!” Wang Wei was pleasantly surprised and repeatedly thanked the judges.</p> 
 <p>“You should be thanking the person who helped you communicate with the participants,” Zhuo Yiyan stated.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei skipped out of the room and returned to the waiting room next door. She rushed forth and embraced Sheng Jiaoyang, catching the latter off guard and planting a kiss on her cheek.</p> 
 <p>“I love you, Jiaojiao!” Wang Wei excitedly exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed her away disdainfully and got up to go to the evaluation room next door.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Wei, you not only saved Xu Jiaojiao in your past life, but you must’ve also saved the entire Galaxy.” <em>To think that a person who barely made it to the top fifteen had now advanced to the National Supermodel’s top six.</em> The others couldn’t help but envy her. </p> 
 <p>When the other contestants, who’d been roasted by the judges, saw them praise the photo on the display screen, they couldn’t help but feel upset. Especially when the judges indisputably announced that this round’s best photo would be awarded to Xu Jiaojiao. They couldn’t help but abhor themselves. Why didn’t they read more books when they were younger? If they’d studied English properly, they wouldn’t have ended up in such a situation and been defeated so easily.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Wei, if Xu Jiaojiao had let you take the photo with the smoking concept, perhaps you would’ve been the one awarded the best photo,” Yin Meiling suddenly blurted.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei cast Yin Meiling a puzzled look and found her words a bit odd. However, she didn’t dwell on it. “Yes, I also took the same picture, but I wasn’t any good. I couldn’t pull off that same impression, so I changed my participants.”</p> 
 <p>“…” Yin Meiling, who’d initially wanted to say that Xu Jiaojiao harboured selfish motives, was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>Everyone stared at Wang Wei with a complicated look. <em>What did this girl do to deserve this? How did she make Xu Jiaojiao spare no pains to help her?</em></p> 
 <p>The best photo had already been announced, so next, they would announce the eliminated contestant.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Yang had earned immunity from the last round, so she didn’t have to worry about being eliminated this round. The other four candidates were waiting with trepidation. </p> 
 <p>When Zhuo Yiyan walked in, they all nervously stared at the photos in his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao, Wang Wei, Luo Yi, Xiao Yang, Pu Mingyu…” With only the last photo remaining, Zhuo Yiyan glanced at two remaining contestants before extending his hand and announcing, “Yin Meiling.”</p> 
 <p>At that instant, Chen Han collapsed and started crying. Xiao Yang turned around to hug her friend, also bursting into tears.</p> 
 <p>After all was said and done, the two friends, who’d accompanied each other thus far, had no choice but to now part ways.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere in the room turned heavy, and the contestants could feel the immense pressure amongst them. In the end, the production crew gave the contestants a day off and returned their phones to them.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang really wanted to fly to Paris to find Lina, but her passport was with the production crew for safekeeping.</p> 
 <p>When Xu Jiaojiao was about to go out, her little fangirl immediately tagged along.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, where are you going? Take me along with you!”</p> 
 <p>Yu Jing immediately sent a cameraman to follow them. Nicely put, it was to record the contestants’ daily life. Truthfully, it was just to keep an eye on Xu Jiaojiao in case she went out and stirred up trouble again, catching the production crew off guard.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang grabbed her little backpack and went out with Wang Wei, the cameraman tagging along.</p> 
 <p>This time, she went out without a destination in mind. She simply wanted to take Wang Wei, who’d never been abroad before, out to broaden her horizons. Before this, all they’d done was focus on completing their missions. They didn’t have the time to appreciate the scenic spots at all. Today was Wang Wei’s very first day trip.</p> 
 <p>“Wow, I finally got to see the London Tower Bridge today! Jiaojiao, quickly come and help me take a few pictures.” As soon as she got off the taxi, Wang Wei dashed straight to the Tower Bridge.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took out her phone to help Wang Wei take a few pictures.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman stood beside her, recording her every movement.</p> 
 <p>After spending the morning in such a leisurely manner, the three of them finally found a restaurant to sit down at.</p> 
 <p>Seeing the cameraman being so faithful to his job even during lunch, Wang Wei couldn’t help but inexplicably ask, “Brother Cameraman, please put down the camera for a bit, alright?” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lifted an eyebrow as she stared at Wang Wei’s bulging cheeks. She handed over a glass of water to Wang Wei and told her to swallow the food in her mouth before talking, lest she choked on the food. </p> 
 <p>“Brother Li, let’s eat first. Only when you eat your fill will you have the energy to work.” Sheng Jiaoyang slightly raised her chin and pointed at the food in front of him, motioning for him to eat first.</p> 
 <p><em>It made sense.</em> Xiao Li pondered for a second before putting the camera away and starting to eat. His eyes lit up when he took the first bite. He secretly darted a look at the short-haired girl eating gracefully opposite him. <em>This girl was really amazing. She’d obviously never been abroad before, but she knew exactly where the best spots were and where there was delicious food. She was like a humanoid navigation system who knew exactly where to go and proceeded without any hesitation.</em></p> 
 <p>Wang Wei ate very quickly and soon finished all her lunch. She belched happily and turned to see Jiaojiao next to her still eating gracefully at an unhurried pace. At this sight, she suddenly felt a little embarrassed.</p> 
 <p>She had long noticed that Jiaojiao ate in a very graceful manner. This time, Wang Wei pretended to play with her phone. She then quietly lifted her phone and slightly turned to point the camera at Jiaojiao, secretly filming a short video and posting it on her Weibo. </p> 
 <p>[My Goddess, thank you so much for taking me around London and taking me to this lovely restaurant to eat such a delicious meal. Love you, love you, love you!!!]</p> 
 <p>After merely two minutes, Wang Wei suddenly saw someone <a href="https://github.com/her" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@her</a> on Weibo. She clicked to have a look and her eyes instantly widened.</p> 
 <p>“OMG!”</p> 
 <p>Xiao Li, who was about to eat the last mouthful of his food, was scared witless by Wang Wei’s sudden yell and unwittingly dropped the food on the table. He was at a loss as he stared at the last bite that he didn’t get to enjoy.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was already used to Wang Wei’s unpredictable behaviour, so she wasn’t surprised at all. She wiped the corners of her mouth and turned to Wang Wei before asking, “What’s the matter?”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, hurry and go on Weibo!” Wang Wei excitedly exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“What for? I don’t have Weibo.”</p> 
 <p>“Huh, really?! No wonder you don't know!”</p> 
 <p>“What happened?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked with a slightly raised eyebrow.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, you’re ranked at the top of Weibo’s search list!” Wang Wei said in an exaggerated tone.</p> 
 <p>The diners at the other tables stared at her, one after another.</p> 
 <p>“If you continue like this and don’t explain, I’ll truly get angry,” Sheng Jiaoyang dully replied. </p> 
 <p>“Uhhh…” Wang Wei’s shoulders nearly reached her ears before she excitedly asked, “Jiaojiao, you know Prince Charming Gu?!”</p> 
 <p>“No, I don’t know him.” Sheng Jiaoyang picked up her backpack and proceeded to pay the bill.</p> 
 <p>“…” Wang Wei, who still had a string of questions, was flabbergasted. </p>

 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>
