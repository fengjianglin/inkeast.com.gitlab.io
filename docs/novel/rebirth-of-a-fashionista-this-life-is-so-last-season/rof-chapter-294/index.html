 <p>“Hohoho! Do you know what I saw in the boss’s office?”</p> 
 <p>“What did you see?”</p> 
 <p>“Our boss has a girlfriend!”</p> 
 <p>“What?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s true. I saw him hugging and whispering to a girl intimately when I entered. Oh my, it's my first time seeing our boss behave so intimately with a girl.”</p> 
 <p>“Joanna, let's celebrate after work, to console our broken hearts.”</p> 
 <p>There were no secrets within the company. Basically, once somebody found something out, it would soon spread to everyone in the company.</p> 
 <p>Back in the boss’s office, Sheng Jiaoyang laid on the sofa and told Shen Zhining about the things that happened recently.</p> 
 <p>Of course, she had to mention her encounter with Daisy and the two resentful women.</p> 
 <p>When she spoke about the encounter, she naturally brought up the time when they were surrounded at the basement car park.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining, who was initially working while listening to her, stopped when he heard her recount the incident. His face quickly grew dark when he found out about the motives of the mastermind who orchestrated the attack.</p> 
 <p>Never had he thought that those two ladies would dare to commit such acts! His eyes were filled with such darkness that he seemed like a savage beast ferocious enough to tear apart anyone who would dare provoke it by touching its scales.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiayoyang was looking through her phone during the entire process and blabbered on without paying attention to Shen Zhining’s emotions. “Speaking of which, Daisy is quite pitiful now. How did her family become bankrupt out of the blue? Things change indeed. Daisy was such a prideful person. When I was your fake girlfriend, she once directly asked me how much she would need to pay for me to leave you. Clearly, she did not place any importance on money at all. But now, she was mocked, just for buying a skirt.”</p> 
 <p>“Even a bank could go bankrupt. Nothing is impossible,” Shen Zhining said calmly.</p> 
 <p>“That’s true. We should enjoy ourselves whilst we still have the ability to. Otherwise, if we are suddenly burdened by a mountain of debt in the future, we will regret not cherishing these beautiful times.”</p> 
 <p>“That day will never come, I'll take care of you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked up at Shen Zhining and laughed, ”Don’t you know that recently, the phrase, ‘Most untrustworthy words from a man: I’ll take care of you!’ has been trending online?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wriggled his brows, stood up, and walked towards Sheng Jiaoyang. “You don't believe me?”</p> 
 <p>“I believe that you have the ability to take care of me, but we still have a long way to go. Who can guarantee that your feelings for me will remain the same? For many divorced couples, when they got together initially, they too did it out of love. But as time passed, they had extramarital affairs, which eventually led to divorce. Although I believe that you would give me happiness, time can bring about many things that can corrode the feeling of love. How many relationships can withstand it?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mood turned slightly sour due to her own words.</p> 
 <p>She was reminded of her parents and herself. She too, said that she would love Lin Yan her whole life. She couldn’t care less when she was deeply in love, but now, that feeling had eroded after a short period of two years.</p> 
 <p><em>So, how long could her relationship with Shen Zhining last?</em></p> 
 <p>Things change, and no one could ever guarantee that they would always stay this intimate. There are too many temptations in this world, and no one could ensure that they would never be tempted.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining came over to sit beside her. He held her hands and looked deep into her eyes. “My father passed away from blocking bullets for my mother. Although the rescuers managed to save both me and my mother in time, my mother chose to overdose herself with sleeping pills a few days later. They were buried together. I couldn’t understand her actions at all. That was until I found the person I love.”</p> 
 <p>It was Sheng Jiaoyang’s first time hearing about his parents’ story. Shen Zhining had never ever mentioned it to anyone else. Never did she expect him to tell it to her so easily now.</p> 
 <p>“If we were to face the same situation, I would be the person blocking the bullets for you.” He spoke calmly, like it was something minor, but at the same time, he spoke with sincerity.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang definitely was shocked. However, his words also helped to lift her depressed mood.</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed, many couples who had loved each other tore at each other for divorce. There were some men who betrayed their wives and family, but there were also many couples who would only bicker often and honour their marriage until old age, like Shen Zhining’s parents, or Grandmother Andy and Grandfather Shen, or like Grandfather, who hadn’t found a new wife after her passing.</em></p> 
 <p><em>If a couple has a sweet and harmonious relationship, how could a third party come in between them?!</em></p> 
 <p>After changing her mindset, Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression became more relaxed, and she even jokingly said, “If you can’t live long and end up dying early, don’t expect me to follow in your footsteps. I still have many things I wish to do. Also, don’t expect me to stay a widow. If there are any young men coming my way, I…”</p> 
 <p>Before she could finish speaking, her whole face was squeezed between Shen Zhining’s hands. Her lips were squished into a pout, and her appearance was so cute that it could make one laugh easily.</p> 
 <p>A glint of amusement flashed through Shen Zhining’s eyes. Then, he asked with a straight face, “If there are young men coming for you, what would you do?”</p> 
 <p><em>Cough cough</em>. ”Let go of me first,” Sheng Jiaoyang blinked.</p> 
 <p>“I need to hear your answer before I can decide if I should let you go,” Shen Zhining replied expressionlessly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at Shen Zhining with innocent eyes. Since her lips were being squeezed out of shape, she could only speak with a slight lisp, “Zhining is the most handsome man in this world. No young men could be compared to you.”</p> 
 <p>Even though he knew full well her words were just compliments, hearing them was still comforting. Thus, Shen Zhining rubbed her face before letting her go.</p> 
 <p>“This is a personal attack!” Sheng Jiaoyang covered her face and looked at Shen Zhining bitterly.</p> 
 <p>“You can counter-attack.” Shen Zhining raised his eyebrows.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes brightened, and she started to rub her hands together, eager to try something out.</p> 
 <p>She moved her hands and cupped Shen Zhining’s face. Initially, she wanted to knead his face, but she got pulled in instead. Shen Zhining’s face got closer to her until suddenly… she was bitten by him.</p> 
 <p>“…” Sheng Jiaoyang was speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>That’s not fair, what happened to ‘You can counter-attack?’</em></p> 
 <p><em>Chomp.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang too returned a bite to his lips. Then, she stared at him, with eyes full of pride.</p> 
 <p>In response to her provocation, Shen Zhining locked her neck and kissed her hard.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was overwhelmed, and she stumbled backwards onto the sofa, with Shen Zhining on top of her. They became a tangled mess.</p> 
 <p>Sparks flew easily when a man and woman were alone together.</p> 
 <p>They were quite aroused…until they heard a knock on the door.</p> 
 <p>Everything came to a halt.</p> 
 <p>In just a moment, Shen Zhining had already straightened himself up and coldly called out to the person waiting outside the door.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang straightened herself up too, and when she saw Jing Weinan walk in, she quickly lowered her head and pretended to play with her mobile phone, whilst listening to their conversation.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, Shane has decided to compromise. They want a meeting tomorrow to discuss the partnership conditions,” Jing Weinan said.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not free tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan’s face twitched. He knew his boss’ schedule like the back of his hand. Thus, he naturally knew if he had the time or not. He sneaked a peek at the woman who was using her mobile phone with her head lowered. <em>Sure enough, women are the natural nemesis of money.</em></p> 
 <p>“Now that they no longer have the upper hand, they wish to partner with us? Let them wait,” Shen Zhining said as if he was venting his anger.</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan nodded, but did not move from his spot.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked up, “Anything else?”</p> 
 <p>“The day after tomorrow is Prince Wight’s birthday party. Is Miss Xu going as well?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked up and eyed Jing Weinan, and turned around to face Shen Zhining. She was familiar with the name Prince Wight. Through Felicia and Fendi’s conversation, her mind could map out a plausible love-hate relationship between Prince Wight and Daisy.</p> 
 <p>“When are you planning to head back?” Shen Zhining asked Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“There are four more days to the movie premiere, I just have to return a day before that.” Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go together then.” Shen Zhining was very keen on bringing Sheng Jiaoyang along to shower her with his love and declare his ownership.</p> 
 <p>“Luckily, I happened to have an evening gown with me.” Sheng Jiaoyang was quite curious about how Prince Wight looked like.</p> 
 <p>“Weinan,” Shen Zhining said, “Please find accommodation for Jiaojiao’s bodyguard.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan responded affirmatively and headed out.</p> 
 <p>The office became quiet once again.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang saw Shen Zhining walk over and said hurriedly, “Go ahead and focus on your work, don’t mind me.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining stood up and walked behind his desk. Then, he tapped a few times on his keyboard and picked up his mobile phone before heading back towards Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“You’re done with work?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked, stunned.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll do it later.” Shen Zhining reached out to her, “Let’s go home.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang held his hand, stood up, and followed him out of the office. She glanced strangely at the VIP elevator and asked, “Isn’t the elevator here?”</p> 
 <p>“I want to look around the office before leaving, to check if there’s anyone lazing around,” Shen Zhining replied calmly.</p> 
 <p>“How do you define lazing around? Are they lazing around if they have completed their jobs? What about those taking a break from their work, are they considered lazy?” Sheng Jiaoyang nagged while being led around by him, “Being such a boss isn’t good, you’re managing them too strictly. No matter how long the employees’ rest, it’s okay as long as they complete their work on time.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining listened to her nagging, and a smile crept upon his face. He let her continue nagging on.</p> 
 <p>They naturally headed to the President Office first. There weren't many employees, just four of them, but they could be considered as Shen Zhining’s eyes in managing the whole company.</p> 
 <p>“Boss.” Everyone was surprised to see their boss entering the office personally.</p> 
 <p>“I won’t be coming into the office for the next few days. I’ll attend to non-urgent matters after I return,” Shen Zhining said.</p> 
 <p>All four of them were silently observing Sheng Jiaoyang, who was standing beside Shen Zhining. From the Western perspective, Asians often appeared to be quite gentle, but beauty knows no borders. Sheng Jiaoyang had some light makeup on, and with her charisma, it was enough to shine in front of others.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining saw their expressions, and introduced to them openly, “This is my fiancée.”</p> 
 <p>Without waiting for their reactions, Shen Zhining brought Sheng Jiaoyang out.</p> 
 <p>“Joanna, I’m really heartbroken.” Whines rang out within the office.</p>
