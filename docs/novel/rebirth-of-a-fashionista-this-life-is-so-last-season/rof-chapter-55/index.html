<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Wang Wei followed Sheng Jiaoyang with a bitter expression as they walked downstairs, catching everyone’s attention.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, what did you do to her?” Luo Yi couldn’t help but ask.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked back at Wang Wei and replied, “She probably forgot to take her medicine.”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei pouted and sulkily retorted, “Then, why didn’t you give me any medicine?!”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>Did she go mad?</em> The others thought, somewhat puzzled.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang chuckled and didn’t respond. She then proceeded towards the kitchen to get the bread that she’d brought back yesterday.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, wait a minute!” Luo Yi stopped Sheng Jiaoyang in her tracks.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned to Luo Yi with an inquiring look.</p> 
 <p>“Did you log onto the internet today?”</p> 
 <p>The very next second, Wang Wei’s eyes instantly lit up, and she hurriedly asked, “Were you going to ask Jiaojiao about her relationship with Prince Charming Gu?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, the other contestants sitting on the sofa also fixed their gazes on Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“We’re not acquainted. I only met him once.” Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t understand why these little girls would think that there was something between that big star named Gu Zhou and her. <em>They’d only met once, so how did this one meeting suddenly turn into a love encounter in their eyes?</em></p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I believe you. I trust that you’ve only met Gu Zhou once, but this isn’t what I’m trying to tell you.” Luo Yi paused for a second before continuing, “When I woke up this morning, I found out that you’ve topped the search rankings, but…”</p> 
 <p>When she got to this point, she suddenly stopped, seemingly not knowing what to say next.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the issue?” Sheng Jiaoyang turned around, her eyes sweeping over the other contestants.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll say it! A public account on Weibo, who frequently reports celebrity scandals, suddenly posted a picture this morning. Uhhh…to be exact, it should be around noon in China. They claim to be reporting actual facts, and that you underwent plastic surgery,” Pu Mingyu explained.</p> 
 <p>“Plastic surgery? No way! That person must be blind! Our Jiaojiao is a natural beauty, so would she even need to do plastic surgery?” Wang Wei immediately retorted angrily.</p> 
 <p><em>Who was the one trailing behind Jiaojiao with a bitter face earlier?!</em> The other contestants were rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p><em>Wang Wei sure was an oddball. They were both contestants, and it wouldn’t matter if they were good friends, but what was up with her acting like Xu Jiaojiao’s crazy fangirl?</em></p> 
 <p>“Huh? How come the production crew didn’t come fetch us and announce our mission yet? They didn’t even confiscate our phones…this is really strange!” Wang Wei suddenly looked around and stated.</p> 
 <p>“I just checked the room next door, but Director Yu and Teacher Zhuo weren’t there. I wonder where they went,” Yin Meiling said.</p> 
 <p>“Are they giving us another day off? If so, then that would be great!” Wang Wei clapped her hands with joy.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took out a few bags of bread of various flavours from the kitchen and shared them with the others.</p> 
 <p>“You two must’ve had a good time yesterday. You both came back so late.” Xiao Yang stared at Sheng Jiaoyang and Wang Wei before suddenly remembering that her best friend hadn’t made it into the top six with her. At this instant, a little bit of sadness washed over her.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe!” Wang Wei smiled ostentatiously and beamed, “I’ve been to a lot of places!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang leaned against the counter of the bar and enjoyed small bites of the bread.</p> 
 <p>After Wang Wei finished showing off, she noticed that no one was paying attention to her. Instead, they were staring at the counter of the bar, so she turned her head and subconsciously lifted her phone and took a photo. Afterwards, she checked the photo and chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“…” The others couldn’t stand to look at her fangirling anymore.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei sat down on the sofa with a piece of bread in her mouth and made another post on her Weibo.</p> 
 <p>[Which unruly person reported that my Goddess underwent plastic surgery? If you have the ability, then why don’t you get plastic surgery yourself and let us see if you’re as beautiful and good-looking as my Jiaojiao? These beautiful long legs, do you have them? This photogenic and graceful aura, do you possess them? Also, this pure and flawless natural countenance, do you have it? If not, then stop blindly tittle-tattling.]</p> 
 <p>Soon, she saw someone with the username Tech-savvy Orbit forward her post. This user had quite a lot of followers. It was more than a hundred thousand to boot!</p> 
 <p>Tech-savvy Orbit: [Sis Jiao’s table manners are so graceful! //Wang Wei: Which unruly person reported that my Goddess underwent plastic surgery? If you have the ability, then why don’t you get plastic surgery yourself and let us see if you’re as beautiful and good-looking as my Jiaojiao? These beautiful long legs, do you have them? This photogenic and graceful aura, do you possess them? Also, this pure and flawless natural countenance, do you have it? If not, then stop blindly tittle-tattling. (Image attached)]</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei recognised this username. During the 30 to 15 elimination round, this user had posted a short edited video with various segments displaying Jiaojiao’s dynamic appearances on National Supermodel. This had helped Jiaojiao’s votes surpass Qi Hua’s in one fell swoop, and consequently win her the number one spot on the popularity ranking list.</p> 
 <p>“Sis Jiao, Unyielding Jiao, haha…” Wang Wei burst into laughter as she smiled by herself, leaving the others confused..</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the door was pushed open and Zhuo Yiyan walked in.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, where did you go so early in the morning?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan seemed to be in a good mood as he replied, “We were notified that the guest we were trying to invite had arrived in London yesterday. This morning, Director Yu and I went to invite her in person, and finally managed to persuade her to make a guest appearance.”</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, who is the guest you mentioned…?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan revealed a mysterious smile and said, “You girls go ahead and get ready. I’ll see you downstairs in five minutes.”</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing Zhuo Yiyan’s peculiar expression which had misled them many times, the contestants kept their guard up.</p> 
 <p>After touching up a bit, the contestants gathered downstairs in front of the apartment before boarding a bus arranged by the production crew.</p> 
 <p>The contestants then looked around curiously as they followed Zhuo Yiyan into a bright and spacious studio. Sheng Jiaoyang immediately saw the logo on the wall at a glance.</p> 
 <p><strong>SL</strong></p> 
 <p>Her heart quivered as a thought welled up in her mind.</p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that they’ve invited Mei Niu again?</em></p> 
 <p>It seemed that the Heavens weren’t playing a joke on her this time. The click-clack of high heels inched closer as she saw the person she was expecting walk into the studio.</p> 
 <p>But, the moment she saw Mei Niu, she was astounded.</p> 
 <p>Mei Niu had cut her hair short and she appeared more gorgeous and extravagant compared to before. Her previous appearance embodied the red carpet celebrity look, but now she appeared more like a successful female entrepreneur.</p> 
 <p>“Hi ladies, we meet again.” As soon as Lina walked in, she’d already sized up the contestants. <em>Everyone seems to be brimming with confidence now. Their looks changed and they gave off a different kind of aura, matching their appearances.</em> However, as the saying goes: Great wits have short memories. Although Lina had seen the girl with ash grey hair at a glance, she didn’t remember who she was.</p> 
 <p>“Lina!”</p> 
 <p>Unlike the others, who were beaming with joy, Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Lina in silence.</p> 
 <p>She knew Lina well, so she understood that although Lina was all smiles on the surface, she wasn’t in a very good mood inside. <em>Looks like the news about Mei Niu and George breaking up was true.</em></p> 
 <p>“Everyone must be aware that Lina owns a company with her own brand, and Lina is also a Perfume R&amp;D Specialist. Today, I brought you girls here to learn from Lina’s experiences…”</p> 
 <p>Before Zhuo Yiyan had finished speaking, several contestants were in an uproar.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, you really think highly of us. Even if you give me another brain, I wouldn’t be able to become a Perfume R&amp;D Specialist.”</p> 
 <p>“Who said anything about letting you girls become Perfume R&amp;D Specialists?” <br> Zhuo Yiyan asked with a raised eyebrow.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you say that yourself? Telling us to learn from Lina’s experiences…” Wang Wei murmured.</p> 
 <p>Although Wang Wei’s voice was quiet, Zhuo Yiyan was standing nearby and heard her. Looking at Wang Wei, he was caught between laughter and tears as he said, “I told you to learn from Lina’s experience, and by that I meant her catwalk experience.”</p> 
 <p>“But, Lina already told us how to do that during the first training lesson.”</p> 
 <p>“At that time, Lina shared her catwalk experience of a clothing fashion show. Today, she’ll share her catwalk experience of a perfume fashion show.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, realisation dawned upon Wang Wei.</p> 
 <p>Lina waited for them to finish talking before saying, “Everyone knows that perfume is incorporeal. A perfume fashion show doesn’t mean that you only have to walk around with a bottle of perfume. This isn’t a new product launch. What we want others to see isn’t a bottle of perfume. Instead, we want the audience to understand the individual characteristics and philosophy behind every bottle of perfume.”</p> 
 <p>Next, she took out several bottles of perfume and sprayed a little of each on scent strips. She then asked the contestants to take a sniff and declare their understanding of each perfume.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that the short-haired girl was being particularly quiet today and not participating in any of the discussions amongst the contestants, Zhuo Yiyan called her aside and asked, “Xu Jiaojiao, are you feeling okay?”</p> 
 <p>“No, I’m fine,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied as she shook her head.</p> 
 <p>“Then, how come you were so absent-minded earlier?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang answered with silence.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan frowned. “Don’t let your personal feelings affect you. You should cherish this opportunity.”</p> 
 <p><em>Indeed, she must cherish this opportunity.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang looked up at Lina, who was currently standing in front of the contestants.</p> 
 <p>The other contestants noticed that Xu Jiaojiao’s disposition instantly changed after conversing with Zhuo Yiyan. Due to this, they became somewhat depressed.</p> 
 <p>Xu Jiaojiao was very familiar with the perfume in the SL brand. As she displayed her knowledge, Lina’s attention completely shifted to her, and the other contestants could only watch on helplessly.</p> 
 <p>Towards noon, everyone stopped what they were doing to eat the food that had been delivered for lunch.</p> 
 <p>Lina was about to go to her private lounge area when Sheng Jiaoyang rushed forward and stopped in front of her.</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao, what are you doing?!” Zhuo Yiyan was also startled by her actions.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang just looked at Lina and said, “I’m a fan of yours. Can I have your autograph?”</p> 
 <p>Lina nodded nonchalantly. “Where do you want it?”</p> 
 <p>“On my body.”</p> 
 <p>“…” Lina.</p> 
 <p>“…” The others.</p> 
 <p>In the end, Lina took Sheng Jiaoyang back to her private lounge for the autograph. Only then did the rest return to their senses.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk, tsk, I really didn’t expect Jiaojiao to be this frenzied when chasing stars,” Wang Wei murmured.</p>
