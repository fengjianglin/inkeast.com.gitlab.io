 <p>After she confirmed her relationship with Shen Zhining, Sheng Jiaoyang slowly started to accept him. </p> 
 <p>But before she could spend more time with Shen Zhining, somebody came to find her.</p> 
 <p>The person said she was her manager, Xu Ping. </p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I was so worried. I couldn’t contact you in the past few days, so I thought something happened to you.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang secretly sized her manager up. She looked very capable and experienced. <em>With such clear eyes, her heart should also be quite just.</em> </p> 
 <p>“Is something the matter?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked in a very mild tone. </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping looked at her helplessly, and she stopped just shy of calling Sheng Jiaoyang her ancestor. Then, she reported to her the progress of the casting for their production, “The male lead and the actors for the other roles have all been chosen, We have also contacted the school and gotten their permission to film there. Director Qin is waiting for you before we proceed.” </p> 
 <p>“Okay.” </p> 
 <p>“Also, didn’t you agree to film a drama with Gu Zhou? I heard that they’ve decided to start shooting the drama on April Fools, the first of April. We still haven’t started filming your movie yet, so by then, there’ll definitely be some conflicts in your schedule.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright.” </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping sighed deeply, “What are you planning to do?”</p> 
 <p>“Let me see the script.” </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping was surprised, “Don’t you have a copy?”</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know where I put it. Just give me another copy.” There wasn’t even the slightest change on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face when she spoke. </p> 
 <p>Maybe it was because Sheng Jiaoyang was way too calm, but even Xu Ping didn’t notice that there was anything off about her. </p> 
 <p>Very soon, Xu Ping gave her a new copy of the script. </p> 
 <p>“Alright, you can leave first. I’ll give you an answer tomorrow.” </p> 
 <p>Xu Ping glanced at Sheng Jiaoyang before she left. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang flipped through the script, and when she was done reading it, a deep frown could be seen on her face. </p> 
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Shen Zhining was staying at home today. </p> 
 <p>“The script’s plot seems rather familiar. I feel like I’ve seen it before.” Sheng Jiaoyang frowned as she tried to recall where she had seen it, but she couldn’t remember. </p> 
 <p>“Of course you find the script familiar. The script was written based on your ideas and direction.” Shen Zhining sat beside her with a cup of tea. </p> 
 <p>“The script was based on my ideas?” Astonishment flashed through Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes. Suddenly, something clicked in her mind, and she understood what happened, “I know why I found the plot so familiar now. The plot is similar to the entries recorded in my mother’s diary… Wait a moment, you said that I composed the plot? So this script is based on my father and mother’s tale?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly stood up with a vexed look on her face.</p> 
 <p>“What happened?” Shen Zhining rubbed her nose gently, “Don’t frown, I’ll help you.”</p> 
 <p>“I’m just thinking, now that I’ve become somebody else, how can I take revenge? I absolutely have to take revenge. At that time, If I wasn’t so resilient, I definitely would’ve been angered to death by Liang Xiaohui and her mother.” Sheng Jiaoyang clenched her fists and ground her teeth in anger. </p> 
 <p>“Liang Xiaohui is already in prison, and it won’t be long before Sheng Shiyun joins her there too.”</p> 
 <p>“What? Liang Xiaohui is already in jail?” Sheng Jiaoyang was shocked. </p> 
 <p>After she finally calmed down, she remembered that she had lost two years of her memory, and understood how it was possible that Liang Xiaohui was in prison. It seems that far too many things had happened in the past two years. Not only did she get together with the man she had always ran away from, she had even taken revenge against Liang Xiaohui. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang asked curiously, “How did Liang Xiaohui get thrown in jail? Did somebody get her in there?”</p> 
 <p>“You found out the truth about the pregnant woman who jumped off the building, and even managed to dig up some evidence.” </p> 
 <p>“So that matter was really caused by Liang Xiaohui? Hmph, she should’ve long gone to prison, but instead, she got to spend so many years wandering around freely. What about Sheng Shiyun? You said that it wouldn’t be long before Sheng Shiyun follows her mother’s footsteps, right? There’s no way my dad would let that happen.” </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was still feeling apprehensive when she suddenly heard Shen Zhining speak. </p> 
 <p>“Uncle Sheng has already passed away.” </p> 
 <p>“Passed away…?” Sheng Jiaoyang turned stiff, and she slowly turned to look at Shen Zhining, “What did you say?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining laid his hand on her head and sighed, “He left all his assets to you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mind went blank. </p> 
 <p>Although Sheng Xun hadn’t shown her much concern or interest, and although he made her feel extremely disappointed in him, she never wanted Sheng Xun to die…</p> 
 <p><em>He was still so young. He wasn’t even fifty, but he left, just like that?</em></p> 
 <p>“I remembered he was fine when I returned, so how…” Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t bring herself to continue speaking.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining simply patted her head silently and comforted her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lowered her eyes, and her gaze landed on the script. She suddenly felt that it was very heavy. </p> 
 <p>Even though she couldn’t remember what it was like to compose the script, she could already understand the urgent feeling to release this movie into the world.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll start producing the movie tomorrow.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining paused for a brief moment. He actually wanted to continue rekindling their affections, but it would also be good for her to start shooting the movie. That way, she won’t feel too softhearted when those shameless people come to her to beg for forgiveness. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was somebody who would always do what she said she would do. Since she’s already decided to produce a good movie, she started to seriously study the script, and she even completely ignored Shen Zhining. </p> 
 <p>The next day, when Xu Ping came by, she saw a very different Jiaojiao from yesterday.</p> 
 <p>Yesterday, Jiaojiao was languid and indifferent towards everything.</p> 
 <p>But today, Jiaojiao was the complete opposite. Today, she was filled with a strong fighting spirit and a sense of urgency.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Sheng Jiaoyang met up with her two collaborators. On the way there, she told Xu Ping about her situation, and learned from her that she had worked with her two colleagues before. They all knew each other well, so she told them about her memory loss. </p> 
 <p>At first, Qin Anliang and Ma Tingting thought she was joking. After all, it hasn’t been that long since they last met. Anybody would find it hard to believe that she suddenly lost her memory just like that.</p> 
 <p>Ma Tingting even joked with her, “There’s a rumour that you quarrelled with your boyfriend. He can’t be mad because you forgot about him when you lost your memory, right?”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right.” </p> 
 <p>Ma Tingting and Qin Anliang exchanged a glance. <em>Could her joke actually be real?</em></p> 
 <p>Now, Ma Tingting was feeling a bit curious, so she asked her, “I saw the video of you at the airport. When Mr. Shen came back at the end to pick you up, I’m guessing that you were standing there because you forgot how to get home? Mr. Shen probably wanted to go home by himself, but the more he thought, the more he regretted it, so he decided to go back to find you, right?”</p> 
 <p>“That’s pretty much what happened, but there’s no reward for you for guessing correctly,” Sheng Jiaoyang laughed.</p> 
 <p>Ma Tingting still wanted to ask for more details, but Qin Anliang interrupted the conversation with a cough, “Let’s hurry up and start shooting, we’re all but ready, except for one final thing.”</p>
