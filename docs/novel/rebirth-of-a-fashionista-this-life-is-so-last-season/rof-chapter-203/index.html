 <p>Liang Xiaohui never expected Sheng Xun to be so ruthless. It was the Lunar New Year, yet he didn't give them any face and went against his parents' wishes.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun felt deeply hurt. She’d long known that her father only had Sheng Jiaoyang in his heart, but when she heard him actually say that Sheng Jiaoyang was his only daughter, strong feelings of despair and hatred instantly filled her.</p> 
 <p>"Sheng Xun, you…" Old Master Sheng wanted to lecture his son with a few words, but he was interrupted.</p> 
 <p>"There’s never been a place for them in this family. If you want them to stay, I'll leave," Sheng Xun stated.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun’s lips parted, seemingly wanting to speak, but she was held back by Liang Xiaohui. With that said, if they were to remain here, they’d certainly lose the two elders’ favourable impression.</p> 
 <p>"Mum, Dad, I'm sorry that Shiyun and I can't stay for lunch today. You have to take care of yourselves," Liang Xiaohui said with tears in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun was choking on sobs as she said, "Grandmother, Grandfather, take care!"</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, the mother-and-daughter pair walked away.</p> 
 <p>"Son, how could you be so ruthless?" Old Madam Sheng lowered her head and stamped her feet.</p> 
 <p>"Even a vicious tiger won’t eat its cubs. Sheng Xun, look at what you've become. You don't even want your own child, are you still human?!"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun listened to the criticism of the two elders with an expressionless face. When they finished, he mocked himself and asked, "Is a living dead person considered a human?"</p> 
 <p>The two elders looked at each other in silence.</p> 
 <p>Liang Xiaohui and Sheng Shiyun walked out and looked back at the villa with the same expression.</p> 
 <p>Their expressions contained resentment, extreme resentment!</p> 
 <p>Liang Xiaohui reached out and caressed Sheng Shiyun’s face as she gently said, "Shiyun, get ready. I've contacted the surgeon for you."</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm." Sheng Shiyun nodded firmly. She then raised her hand and touched her own face. "Since everyone likes Sheng Jiaoyang that much, I’ll just become her! I must take back everything that belongs to me!"</p> 
 <p>"Shiyun, Mother's hopes are all on you, so don't let me down,” Liang Xiaohui said.</p> 
 <p>"Mum, don't worry, I’ll never let those who bullied me and looked down on me off."</p> 
 <p>Contrary to the cold and cheerless Sheng family, Grandfather Yang’s place was very lively.</p> 
 <p>The old and the young were seated around the long dining table, with the two elders sitting at both ends.</p> 
 <p>This time, An Jing was also present. He sat next to Grandfather Yang on the left side, while Sheng Jiaoyang sat on her grandfather’s right side. Liang Dahui made Xu Qi sit next to An Jing. As for the other spot on Sheng Jiaoyang’s right, it was specifically reserved for Shen Zhining. Xu Ping, who’d stayed behind to celebrate the new year with them, sat in the middle next to the two little boys, who were sitting next to each other.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, what did you talk about with my brother-in-law?" Liang Dahui asked.</p> 
 <p>A trace of impatience flashed across Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes, and she wanted to ask Liang Dahui to shut up. However, after a second thought, she suddenly smiled and deliberately replied, "Aunt, you probably don't know what your sister has done, do you?"</p> 
 <p>Liang Dahui’s eyebrows twitched. "What did Xiaohui do?"</p> 
 <p>"She stole several valuable jewellery pieces from Sheng Jiaoyang’s room! Some of the jewellery was worth millions and hasn’t been returned yet. I heard that she sold them on the black market a long time ago. It’s because she didn’t hand those jewellery pieces back that she was kicked out of the house. She didn’t tell you about such an important matter?" Sheng Jiaoyang laughed with schadenfreude.</p> 
 <p>"No, that can't be true!" Liang Dahui’s eyes widened in disbelief. She’d always thought that her sister was a rich madam, so how could she be stupid enough to steal jewellery and let people know about it? Moreover, Liang Xiaohui was the most promising daughter in the family as she’d been smart since she was a child. The fact that she’d turned from a nobody to a rich madam was enough to prove how clever she was.</p> 
 <p>Except for Zhang Aiyan, who’d just joined the Xu family, everyone else had met Liang Xiaohui before. Xu Qi, who went to Liang Xiaohui’s place every year to pay New Year's greetings, was particularly shocked at this revelation.</p> 
 <p>"Nothing is impossible in this world. Some people are, after all, short-sighted and can only see what’s in front of them. It’s quite common for people to do anything in their means to become rich." Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes swept across the Xu family.</p> 
 <p>"Xiaohui isn’t that kind of person. Could it be a misunderstanding?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the unresigned Liang Dahui and coldly uttered, "She was caught red-handed, there’s irrefutable evidence."</p> 
 <p>Liang Dahui’s lips parted, but she didn't know how to justify this. When there was irrefutable evidence, explanations were just quibbles.</p> 
 <p>"I can’t believe that my aunt is that kind of person," Xu Qi murmured.</p> 
 <p>"To be honest, she’s actually not in such a bad position. Although she became Mrs Sheng, mistresses enjoyed a better life than her. Mistresses can spend as much money as they want and just need to act coquettish to make up for it. Whereas, Liang Xiaohui…haha, she had to coax the old madam just to get money to buy cosmetics. Now that she’s divorced, she doesn’t need to return the stolen pieces of jewellery anymore, and she got a huge sum of alimony. As long as she doesn’t court disaster, she can use the alimony to enjoy a comfortable life."</p> 
 <p>"You're spouting nonsense! You've never been to Sheng manor, so how do you know all this? You’re obviously making things up." Liang Dahui glared at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow and asked, "Weren’t you the one who wanted to know what I discussed with Sheng Xun?"</p> 
 <p>"As expected, you’re having an affair with him! Were you the reason behind Xiaohui’s divorce?" Liang Dahui angrily rebuked.</p> 
 <p>The whole dining room quieted down.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qi and Zhang Aiyan both looked at Liang Dahui with a ‘did you go mad?’ expression. <em>Not to mention having Grandfather Yang as her backer, Xu Jiaojiao also has a rich and handsome boyfriend. How stupid would she be to have an affair with a middle-aged man?</em></p> 
 <p>"Dahui, you… Xiao Ze, quickly keep your wife in check." Grandmother Xu didn’t dare to scold Liang Dahui, so she let Xu Ze discipline his wife.</p> 
 <p>As for Xu Ze, he could only smile helplessly. <em>How would he dare to discipline his fierce wife?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang unhurriedly picked up a tissue and wiped the corners of her mouth. She then stood up and said, "Grandfather, I suddenly lost my appetite. I'm going to take a stroll."</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, I'm sorry, your aunt didn’t…" Xu Ze hurriedly apologised, but before he could finish his sentence, Shen Zhining also stood up.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather Yang, I'll go with her," Shen Zhining said before leaving the room.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang's expression turned grim. He exuded an oppressive aura as he swept his eyes over the Xu family members, focusing on Liang Dahui. Afterwards, he turned to An Jing and said, "Arrange a car after lunch and make sure to get them home safely."</p> 
 <p>"Alright." An Jing nodded.</p> 
 <p>Liang Dahui regretted her impulsive behaviour. <em>She’d ruined her precious son's future with her own hands.</em> She tried to explain herself but was held back by Xu Ze and Xu Qi as they motioned for her to stop talking.</p> 
 <p>"You’re a bad person!" Xiao An clenched his fists and glared at Liang Dahui.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Hu also joined in and exclaimed, "Those who bully Aunt Jiaojiao are bad people!"</p> 
 <p>Xu Ping hurriedly picked up two chicken legs and placed them into their bowls in an attempt to distract them so that they’d quieten down.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang smiled and stared at the two little ones with an affectionate gaze.</p> 
 <p>"Dad, I'm sorry about that. My sister-in-law was just anxious about her sister and misspoke earlier," Xu Qing apologised.</p> 
 <p>"Alright, let's eat," Grandfather Yang responded.</p> 
 <p>The Xu family members couldn’t eat under this awkward atmosphere. When it was time to collect the leftovers, there was still a lot of rice left in their bowls.</p> 
 <p>"An Jing, see the guests off," Grandfather Yang instructed.</p> 
 <p>The Xu family were all dejected and felt very humiliated.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather, we haven't celebrated Jiaojiao's birthday yet!" Liang Dahui brazenly exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang glanced at her. "Jiaojiao has her boyfriend accompanying her." He emphasized the word ‘boyfriend’.</p> 
 <p>Liang Dahui was left speechless.</p> 
 <p>As for the birthday girl, she was currently sitting in the driver's seat and trying her best to act like a novice driver.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining, who was sitting next to her, was watching her every move.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang drove with caution and amused herself while thinking that her acting skills had improved thanks to Shen Zhining. She gave it her all to deal with him, and in order to not let him see through her, she’d developed her acting skills to their current level.</p> 
 <p>"I think I'm very talented!” she boasted after gradually improving her driving.</p> 
 <p>"Yes, you’re not bad." It was rare for Shen Zhining to give her recognition in such a straightforward manner.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang almost couldn’t restrain her smile. She shot a glance at Shen Zhining and stopped playing around. After driving around the training ground, she suddenly heard him ask, "You already know how to drive?"</p> 
 <p><em>Uh…this question was a bit tricky to answer!</em></p> 
 <p><em>If she answered with a yes, he’d certainly ask her when she’d learned how. However, if she answered with a no, he’d continue asking her other questions to clear up his doubts.</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the rearview mirror in an attempt to examine his expression.</p> 
 <p>"Was the question that difficult to answer?"</p> 
 <p>"No, I was just thinking, now that I've learned to drive, where are we going next?" Sheng Jiaoyang used her same old trick and changed the subject.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her with a profound gaze and said, "Wherever you want."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang breathed a sigh of relief and seriously thought about their next destination. The amusement park was already closed, and they couldn’t go to places with large crowds. They also couldn’t go to the beach in this weather.</p> 
 <p>"Shall we go ice skating?" Her eyes lit up and she turned to look at Shen Zhining with an expectant gaze.</p> 
 <p>"I’ve already said that you can go wherever you want, I'll accompany you."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang awkwardly turned away and opened her car door. "Let's go."</p> 
 <p>They then boarded another car and the driver took them to a skating rink.</p> 
 <p>There were a lot of people skating inside. To avoid trouble, Sheng Jiaoyang arrived wearing a mask and a hat with a wide brim that concealed her eyes. As for Shen Zhining, he wasn’t a public figure, so there wasn’t any need for him to dress up like that.</p>
