<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>As soon as they entered the private lounge and Sheng Jiaoyang had closed the door behind them, Lina started scrutinising her.</p> 
 <p>“Shoot! What do you want to say to me?” Lina calmly asked.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Lina like this, Sheng Jiaoyang decided not to reveal her identity yet. Instead, mimicking Wang Wei’s exaggerated tone, she said, “Lina, I really like you a lot. I’m a loyal fan of yours.”</p> 
 <p>“In that case, take off your clothes!” </p> 
 <p>As she said this, Lina’s expression remained indifferent.</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t you ask for my autograph earlier? You were the one who wanted me to sign it on your body, right?” At this instant, a trace of mockery flashed across Lina’s eyes.</p> 
 <p><em>Looks like she’d overdone it…</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang faintly smiled. </p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Lina’s expression darkened a few shades. Just when she was about to get angry, Sheng Jiaoyang abruptly called out, “Mei Niu!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lina trembled all over and frowned at the unfamiliar girl standing in front of her.</p> 
 <p>“Shocked to hear this? You must be wondering how I know your nickname, right? In fact, I was also shocked that day when I woke up in the hospital. When I found out that I’d become someone else and was residing in an unfamiliar environment, I was even more shocked than you. Please don’t say anything and hear me out first…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand to stop Lina who’d wanted to interrupt her, and continued, “I know that what I’m saying is completely unfathomable and that no one would believe me, or better yet, no one would dare to believe me. However, you’re my closest kin aside from my grandfather, so you must believe me! Mei Niu, I need your help. Grandfather’s health has deteriorated a lot and I don’t want him to bear the burden and shock of his loved ones leaving him one by one.”</p> 
 <p>She looked straight at Lina; her tone extremely solemn.</p> 
 <p>Lina’s eyes reddened and she murmured in Italian, “Little Sun, is it really you?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang slowly approached Lina and gently replied, “Yes, it’s me.”</p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu, I’m back!”</p> 
 <p>Lina’s vision was blurred by unshed tears as she questioned, “One time, the two of us went to Vatican City…what did you tell me back then at St. Peter’s Square?”</p> 
 <p>“How nice it would be if we were homosexuals. Then, we wouldn’t have to worry about us growing apart when one of us fell in love with someone else in the future,” Sheng Jiaoyang quietly answered.</p> 
 <p>Tears coursed down Lina’s cheeks, and the corners of her mouth slightly raised, revealing a faint smile.</p> 
 <p>“What did you promise me at the airport six months ago?” she asked in a trembling voice.</p> 
 <p>“I promised that I would take good care of myself.”</p> 
 <p>“And? Did you manage to keep your promise?” Lina instantly broke down.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang reached out and hugged Lina. She stroked the latter’s back with her hands and said, “I’m sorry…”</p> 
 <p>“The one you’ve let down isn’t me but yourself, idiot!” Lina raised her hand and pummelled Sheng Jiaoyang on the back.</p> 
 <p><em>It hurts!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang bared her teeth and helplessly said, “Mei Niu, be gentler. If this healthy body of mine sustains any internal injuries, you’ll have to take care of me for the rest of my life.”</p> 
 <p>“It doesn’t matter! What, are you afraid that I don’t have the ability to provide for you?” Lina glared at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“No, that’s not what I meant!” Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly denied and bootlicked. “My Mei Niu is very capable! Raising ten of me shouldn’t pose a problem at all!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lina instantly burst into laughter. Her eyes were still red and moist as she cried and laughed at the same time. Her current appearance could melt one’s heart. After a moment, she abruptly stepped back and thoroughly sized Sheng Jiaoyang up from top to toe again. “Little Sun, you finally have your wish fulfilled.”</p> 
 <p>“Huh?”</p> 
 <p>“I meant your current height!” Lina blurted out. </p> 
 <p>“In the past, what distressed you the most was your height. Look at you now! You’re nearly as tall as me.”</p> 
 <p>A faint smile appeared in the corners of Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips.</p> 
 <p>“I remember that you called out to me last month during the training session…were you planning to tell me the truth then?” Lina suddenly asked.</p> 
 <p>“Yep.” Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t deny it as it was the truth.</p> 
 <p>Lina slightly regretted her actions from back then. If only she’d stayed a little longer at that time, then she wouldn’t have had to wait until now.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang could read Lina’s thoughts at a glance, so she comforted her and said, “It isn’t too late to learn the truth now. By the way, what happened to your mum? Is everything okay now?”</p> 
 <p>Lina was about to reply when someone knocked on the door. So, she could only keep it short and simply told Sheng Jiaoyang that her mother was doing alright.</p> 
 <p>“Who is it?”</p> 
 <p>“Lina, Mr Zhuo said that he has something to discuss with Xu Jiaojiao.” The assistant outside the door clarified.</p> 
 <p>“Got it, tell him to wait for a bit.”</p> 
 <p>Following this, Lina winked at Sheng Jiaoyang and teased, “You sure have luck with men, no matter where you go!”</p> 
 <p>“What luck with men? I don’t have that thing,” Sheng Jiaoyang chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“Tsk! If you didn’t have any luck with men, would that guy called Lin Yu take the initiative to pursue you?”</p> 
 <p>“Hey, I still haven’t questioned you yet…what happened between you and George?”</p> 
 <p>Lina’s expression froze for a moment before she turned sideways, subconsciously not wanting to discuss this matter further.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t blame me for sprinkling salt on your wound. If you don’t tell me, then how would I know what’s going on between the two of you? Or…do you no longer want to share your secrets with me?”</p> 
 <p>Lina took a deep breath with her eyes closed before saying, “He was the one who initiated the break up.”</p> 
 <p>“Why?” Sheng Jiaoyang knew that George was a jealous person. When she spent even a minute longer with Mei Niu, he would start to dislike her. </p> 
 <p>“I don’t know…” Lina then quickly changed the topic. “Anyways, Zhuo Yiyan is looking for you, so you better hurry and go. He might start thinking that I’m bullying you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand and captured Lina’s chin as she retorted, “Tsk, he must be afraid that I’ll bully you, alright?” She then turned around and left the private lounge with a smile plastered on her face.</p> 
 <p>Lina couldn’t help but smile at this. As soon as she turned sideways, she was stunned to see herself smiling in the full-length mirror. After recovering, she raised an eyebrow at her reflection.</p> 
 <p><em>How great! Little Sun is back now!</em></p> 
 <p>She didn’t mind nor was she afraid of the fact that Sheng Jiaoyang had become another person. The thing she was most afraid of had already become history. Even if Sheng Jiaoyang were to be reborn as a cat or a dog, she would calmly face it and accept her. As long as her Little Sun was still alive, she didn’t care about what form she was reborn in.</p> 
 <p>Upon knowing that Sheng Jiaoyang was still alive, Lina felt much more at ease and the feeling of emptiness residing in her heart finally faded. Even the fact that she’d already broken up with George seemed more acceptable now.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, that’s right! I need to contact Grandfather Yang.” Lina suddenly remembered and made a phone call. <em>Little Sun had asked her to appease her grandfather before she’d left.</em></p> 
 <p>At the same time, Sheng Jiaoyang, who’d just left the private lounge area, was called to one side by Zhuo Yiyan.</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao, what explanation do you have for what just happened?” Zhuo Yiyan asked. </p> 
 <p>“What kind of explanation do you want to hear?” Sheng Jiaoyang tilted her head and added, “Isn’t it normal for fans to feel excited when meeting their favourite star?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan choked upon hearing this. “I can see that you’re a rational person.”</p> 
 <p>Rational people would calmly restrain their emotions even when they were pursuing their favourite stars. <em>Was it normal to ask for an autograph on her body?</em></p> 
 <p>Xu Jiaojiao’s performance over the past few days was still vivid in his mind. Although she could occasionally be hateful, she was very smart and lovely most of the time. Thus, what had just happened completely overturned the previous impression he’d had of her, catching him off guard.</p> 
 <p><em>If anyone was fuming with rage between gritted teeth at this girl, it would definitely be Yu Jing.</em></p> 
 <p><em>No matter how many precautions they took, Xu Jiaojiao was unstoppable!</em></p> 
 <p>Xu Jiaojiao never played her cards according to the rules. If it weren’t for the fact that her popularity had skyrocketed and the Chief had instructed them to keep her, Yu Jing would’ve certainly eliminated her in the next round so she couldn’t cause more trouble for the production crew.</p> 
 <p>“No matter how rational someone is, they’re allowed to have their personal interests, right?” Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t buy Zhuo Yiyan’s words. </p> 
 <p>“You call that a personal interest? That’s more like an obsession, alright?!”</p> 
 <p><em>Who was the one that had said that Xu Jiaojiao wouldn’t cause any more trouble? Look at the current her…causing trouble. There were still several competition rounds left, and the semifinals and finals were just around the corner. The production crew had already prepared the competition layout and deployment in advance. This girl better stop stirring up trouble! Fortunately, the person they were facing this time was Lina, who was a classic case of cold hands, warm heart. If it were someone else, then they would’ve fallen out on the spot!</em></p> 
 <p>"Lina agreed to my request, so what else do you have to say?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan felt as if the veins on his forehead were about to pop out. He hastily took a deep breath and said, “I just wanted to remind you that you shouldn’t act so impudent in front of an esteemed guest next time.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not like the other guests are my favourite stars. Even if they were to give me their autograph, I wouldn’t feel inclined to accept them,” Sheng Jiaoyang casually replied.</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan waved feebly and told her to hurry back to the other contestants.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips slightly arched into a smirk and she happily strode away in a relaxed manner.</p>
