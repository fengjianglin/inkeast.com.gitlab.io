 <p>Gu Zhou would probably cry if he heard that. </p> 
 <p>“End of discussion!” Li Yu didn’t want to be led by the nose. “Do you have a Weibo account?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lazily replied, “Nope.”</p> 
 <p>Li Yu frowned as he listened to her lackadaisical tone and said, “I’ll arrange an assistant for you. Don’t stir up any more trouble for the next two days.” </p> 
 <p>“Stir up trouble? Do you really believe that it was me?” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Li Yu. </p> 
 <p>Li Yu just waved his hand, not wanting to talk with her any more.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang returned to the table, she saw Pan Mingyue talking with Lina while Pan Ziyue was sitting there anxiously.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go then!” Lina stood up when she saw Sheng Jiaoyang approaching.</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui opened his mouth as if to say something, but then not knowing where to begin, he could only watch as the two people walked away.</p> 
 <p>“What did President Li say?” Lina asked once they were back in the car.</p> 
 <p>“He told me not to cause trouble.”</p> 
 <p>“But, it’s not like you caused it!” Lina frowned.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shrugged. “He probably has too much free time.”</p> 
 <p>“I took a look at those ‘authentic’ photos. They’re actually just modified images of some of our photos taken at the banquet. I just don’t know who this guy is.”</p> 
 <p>“It seems that someone is trying to crush us both at the same time,” Sheng Jiaoyang said without lifting her head as she slid her fingers across her phone screen.</p> 
 <p>Lina laughed, then looked at Sheng Jiaoyang before saying, “Jiaojiao, it looks like your ability to pull aggro is even stronger than before! I must’ve been dragged in by you.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you afraid?”</p> 
 <p>“Even if it was true, I wouldn’t be afraid!”</p> 
 <p>The two of them looked at each other, then burst out laughing.</p> 
 <p>On the other side, Gu Zhou’s manager had just gotten the notification and went to find Gu Zhou. </p> 
 <p>The manager didn’t conceal anything and told Gu Zhou the whole situation. “President Li signed a new person. In the end, this person has gotten involved in a homosexuality scandal today. President Li wants you to let a hand in this matter.” </p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou calmly waited for his manager to finish speaking before asking, “That person was contracted by President Li himself?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, he personally recruited that person.”</p> 
 <p><em>What kind of person could make President Li personally move?</em> He frowned as he kneaded his forehead. “Did President Li say what he wants me to do?”</p> 
 <p>“He said that you have to stir up a rumour with her for a bit. If you post something about her right now, it’ll definitely cause a huge scandal.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s a woman?” Surprise flashed through Gu Zhou’s eyes. “Who is she?”</p> 
 <p>“Her name’s Xu Jiaojiao.”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou was surprised and laughed. <em>So, it was actually that little girl.</em></p> 
 <p>“Why are you still laughing? Don’t you normally loathe these kinds of rumours?” The outsiders were always more worried than the person himself. The manager felt as if something was wrong as he watched Gu Zhou suddenly start laughing. </p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou had always treated things like getting publicity through rumours with disgust, disliking these sorts of cheap tricks. Even when he was dating, he would never make public displays of affection on Weibo.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect that one day she would become my junior. It’s really her style, just entering and already stirring up such rumours. Homosexuality, huh? Tsk tsk!” Gu Zhou didn’t seem to mind promoting Xu Jiaojiao. </p> 
 <p>“You don’t mind?” The manager was especially surprised.</p> 
 <p>The corners of Gu Zhou’s mouth lifted. “She’s just a little girl. If I can give her a push, why not?” </p> 
 <p>The manager nodded.</p> 
 <p>“Since you don’t mind, there’s no problem. Are you posting it on Weibo or should I help you do it?”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll post it myself!” Gu Zhou replied.</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
