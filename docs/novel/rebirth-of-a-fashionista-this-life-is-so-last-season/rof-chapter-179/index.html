 <p>"Fight over someone like him?" Hearing Pan Mingyue's words, Sheng Jiaoyang sneered. "Your father is a treasure in your family, but he’s worthless in mine. We’d be out of our minds to pick up garbage that can’t be recycled."</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue was relieved, but at the same time, displeased with the fact that Sheng Jiaoyang was belittling her father. She murmured under her breath, "I forbid you to talk about dad like that. He’s the best father in the world."</p> 
 <p>"In that case, I’ll take back my words. Although your father is rubbish, he still has some recycling value."</p> 
 <p>"Are you regretting it now?" Pan Mingyue looked at her warily.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang solemnly answered, "I just thought of something. Over the past ten years, your father hasn't given us a penny for child support."</p> 
 <p>"Are you short on money now?" Pan Mingyue cast a suspicious look at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"No one would think that they have too much money, right?"</p> 
 <p>"Then, how much do you want?"</p> 
 <p>Seeing how Pan Mingyue was ready to bargain with her, Sheng Jiaoyang laughed. "I'm just teasing you. We didn't ask him for alimony during the most difficult times, so now it's even more unlikely. Don't worry, he’s your father and yours alone. My mother and I don't want anything to do with him."</p> 
 <p>"Alright, don't bother me about this kind of boring matter in the future." Sheng Jiaoyang then turned to get in the car. As she did so, she inadvertently caught sight of a girl with a sinister look on her face rushing over with a glass bottle from the corner of her eye.</p> 
 <p>In that split second, Sheng Jiaoyang didn't think as she grabbed Pan Mingyue and dragged her inside the car.</p> 
 <p>Clatter! The moment the door was closed, some kind of liquid hit the window.</p> 
 <p>As the liquid slid down, it made corrosive sounds.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps her days were leisurely lately, and adding on the fact that they were at school, but the bodyguards had let their guard down and didn't react on time. Only now did they move to catch the girl.</p> 
 <p>Many students watched this scene unfold from the sidelines and exclaimed that they didn’t expect for something like this to happen on campus.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue was practically dragged into the car by Sheng Jiaoyang. She was lying on top of Sheng Jiaoyang, and her head hit the back of the chair. She was still in a state of confusion and only recovered when she heard the screams outside.</p> 
 <p>"Why did you drag me into the car? Are you trying to kidnap me?" Pan Mingyue glared at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang pushed Pan Mingyue away and got out from the other side.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue was about to open the door on her side to get out of the car, but she was stopped by Sheng Jiaoyang’s shout, "Don't open that door! Come here and get down from this side."</p> 
 <p>Her tone was very solemn, and Pan Mingyue didn't know why, but she subconsciously did what she was told and got out of the car from Sheng Jiaoyang’s side.</p> 
 <p>"Let me go!" The girl who was caught struggled with all her strength.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang walked over, she first cast a glance at the corroded car door before shifting her gaze to the girl and coldly asking, "Were you going to splash that on me?"</p> 
 <p>"You b_tch! B_tch!" the girl shouted hysterically at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>This girl didn’t look like a sane person.</p> 
 <p>"OMG!" Pan Mingyue was startled. When she saw the corroded car door, she patted her chest to alleviate her lingering fear.</p> 
 <p>"Xu Jiaojiao, are you alright?" a few onlookers asked with concern.</p> 
 <p>"I'm fine. Thank you for your concern. Could someone please call the police and explain the situation? Additionally, I would like to ask the students who witnessed the scene for a favour. Could you please stay here and be witnesses?" Sheng Jiaoyang methodically asked.</p> 
 <p>"I saw everything."</p> 
 <p>"I saw it, too."</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>More than a dozen students saw the whole process, and two even said that they saw another person next to the girl who splashed the corrosive liquid on the car. However, that person ran away after the girl was caught.</p> 
 <p>The school’s security guards promptly arrived and they stayed around to maintain order. The sirens of police cars followed soon after. At the same time, several reporters also appeared.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue witnessed, for the first time, how her half-sister handled this matter in an unperturbed manner. After Xu Jiaojiao answered the police officers’ inquiries, she proceeded to answer the reporters' questions while pacifying the students around her from time to time. Her ability to efficiently take care of this matter opened Pan Mingyue’s eyes.</p> 
 <p><em>Earlier, in the face of such a dangerous situation, Xu Jiaojiao even went out of her way to drag her into the car. Xu Jiaojiao clearly didn't like her that much, but she didn't leave her when they were in danger. She now saw her half-sister in a better light and liked her a bit more.</em></p> 
 <p>Since Sheng Jiaoyang was a public figure and a student, adding on the fact that she’d just received a ‘shock’, the police merely took note of the evidence at the scene and didn’t ask her to make a trip to the bureau to give a statement. They told her to go home and have a good rest, and said that they’d inform her once they have more clues. Afterwards, they took the culprit with them and set off.</p> 
 <p>"Let's disperse! Thank you for your cooperation."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to get in the car, but when she saw that Pan Mingyue hadn’t left yet, she halted and said, "You saw what happened today, so don't come near me in the future. Your parents would blame me if something were to happen to you." Then, she boarded the car.</p> 
 <p>"So what? I’m not afraid!" Pan Mingyue mumbled as she stared at the departing car. Despite this, as she recalled the corroded door, she shivered.</p> 
 <p>When Pan Mingyue arrived home, she noticed that her mother wasn't back yet. However, her father, who usually returned late, was currently sitting on the sofa and staring at his phone.</p> 
 <p>"Dad, where's mum?" She walked to Pan Zihui’s side.</p> 
 <p>"Your mother’s at the beauty salon. She said that she’ll be back a bit later today."</p> 
 <p>"Oh." Pan Mingyue glanced at his phone screen and asked, "What are you reading?"</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui immediately passed Pan Mingyue his cell phone.</p> 
 <p>"Wow, the news is out already? How fast!" Pan Mingyue was surprised as she skimmed through the article.</p> 
 <p>"Mingyue, I noticed that you were also there. Did you get hurt anywhere?" <br> Pan Zihui asked with concern.</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue cast a sidelong glance at her father and asked, "You just want to know if Xu Jiaojiao is okay, right?"</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui smiled awkwardly and patted Pan Mingyue’s shoulder. "My baby girl is the one I’m most concerned about."</p> 
 <p>Pan Mingyue immediately beamed with joy and said, "Luckily, she was quick on her feet and dragged me into the car, so neither of us got hurt. Although that crazy girl wasn’t aiming at me, I would’ve been disfigured if even a tiny bit of that liquid had hit my face!"</p> 
 <p>"I'm glad nothing happened. Fortunately, you weren’t hurt."</p> 
 <p>"I never thought that being a star would be so dangerous. Xu Jiaojiao isn’t even that famous yet, but there are already people who’re trying to ruin her. When she gets super famous, I really wonder what those jealous people will resort to!" Pan Mingyue sighed.</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui felt bitter. He’d previously seen a post dedicated to Xu Jiaojiao, saying that she’d participated in the supermodel competition because her family was poor and that she needed the prize money. If she made it to the finals, she could use the prize money to lighten the burden on her family. Mingyue was also his daughter, yet she could be carefree every day and get whatever she wanted. She didn’t need to worry about money at all.</p> 
 <p>"Mingyue, do you mind if I acknowledge her as my daughter?" Pan Zihui cautiously asked.</p> 
 <p>"I don't mind, but…" Pan Mingyue pondered for a moment. "She doesn’t want to acknowledge you. She told me that neither she nor her mother want to have anything to do with you. You'd better not disturb them. She now has a powerful backer and a rich boyfriend, so she must be leading a great life."</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui was silent. He knew that the mother-and-daughter pair was doing well, but Jiaojiao was also his daughter. If he didn’t acknowledge her, he wouldn’t feel at ease.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Sheng Jiaoyang, who was leading a ‘great life’, got home, she was continuously questioned by her grandfather. Grandfather Yang was scared out of his wits and only calmed down after repeatedly confirming that she wasn’t hurt. He then judged the matter as it stood and criticised Sheng Jiaoyang’s bodyguards. He was quite dissatisfied with the fact that they’d failed to detect the danger in time. Afterwards, he mobilised his connections to investigate the mastermind behind this incident.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought it was odd that she hadn’t heard anything from the person who was supposed to be the most concerned about her right now. Even when she was about to go to bed, she still hadn’t received a single call from him.</p> 
 <p>Thus, she took the initiative and called him. To her surprise, the call was answered instantly.</p> 
 <p>"Are you sleeping?" Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>"Not yet, I'm still taking care of something."</p> 
 <p>"It’s already so late, can’t you deal with it tomorrow?"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining paused and asked with a slight smile, "Are you expressing your concern for me?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt a peculiar feeling in her heart, but she quickly feigned calmness and replied, "Of course, I’m worried about you. If you were to age prematurely in the prime of your life, won't I have to find a new boyfriend?"</p> 
 <p>"Age prematurely in the prime of my life?" Shen Zhining repeated.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang coughed guiltily and said, "I'm just reminding you to go to bed early."</p> 
 <p>Before Shen Zhining could reply, another voice was heard on the other end of the phone.</p> 
 <p>"Boss, it’s been verified that the person who took the girl out of the psychiatric hospital, and the one who sent the letters to the company, is the same person." Sheng Jiaoyang recognised Jing Weinan’s voice immediately.</p> 
 <p>Following this, she heard Shen Zhining say, "Find that person first."</p> 
 <p>"We’re already looking into it."</p> 
 <p>"Let's call it a day and go home."</p> 
 <p>After several pauses, Sheng Jiaoyang heard Shen Zhining ask, "You heard everything?"</p> 
 <p>"Who are you looking for?" Sheng Jiaoyang was a little curious.</p> 
 <p>"Weren’t you attacked at school today? I suspect the mastermind behind that is the same person who sent me letters about you."</p> 
 <p>"You guys were talking about that earlier? So, it turns out that your suspicions are right. Who on earth hates me to the bone? Say, could it be that he or she is the same person who hired the Internet Water Army to trash me?"</p> 
 <p>"Alright, I'll ask someone to investigate it, so let’s leave it at that for today. I don’t want to hear someone say that I’m ageing prematurely anymore, so I’ve decided to go home now and rest early."</p> 
 <p><em>…She was speechless! They’d talked about so many things, so how could they still end with the words she’d said earlier??</em></p> 
 <p>"I'm sleepy, so I’m going to bed now. Good night!" Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly hung up the phone.</p> 
 <p>She stared at the screen and thought of how Shen Zhining sought revenge for the smallest grievance. <em>Don’t tell her that he was going to remember those words for the rest of his life?</em></p> 
 <p>The next day, Sheng Jiaoyang saw a neatly dressed Shen Zhining with perfectly combed hair sitting at her dining table.</p> 
 <p>After breakfast, Sheng Jiaoyang got up and prepared to go to school. Today, she had to attend the stage rehearsal of the New Year's evening party.</p> 
 <p>"I'll drive you." Shen Zhining also got up and followed her out.</p>
