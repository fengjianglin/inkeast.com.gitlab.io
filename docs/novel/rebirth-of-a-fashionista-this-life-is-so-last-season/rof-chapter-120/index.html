<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Shen Zhining suffered from insomnia.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know if it was because there was no one to give him a head massage tonight or…</p> 
 <p>That kiss with a hint of honey.</p> 
 <p>Since Shen Zhining was half awake and half asleep the entire time, he immediately woke up upon hearing some movements in the morning. He opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling, listening to the sound of wheels rolling outside the door. It seemed that someone was dragging a suitcase along the hallway. He frowned and subconsciously thought: <em>Is she leaving?</em></p> 
 <p>"Where are you going?" He opened the door and, as expected, he saw her heading downstairs with a suitcase.</p> 
 <p>His expression was a tad cold as he walked over and asked again, "Where are you going?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang placed her suitcase in a standing position and looked over. Seeing Shen Zhining in his pajamas staring at her with a dark expression, she habitually smiled at him and explained, "I have to go abroad for a few days to settle some matters, sorry for waking you up. Also, thanks for picking me up last night…what happened to your lips?" She noticed the scab on Shen Zhining’s lower lip.</p> 
 <p>"So, you remember that I picked you up? What about the rest?" Shen Zhining asked inexplicitly.</p> 
 <p>"The rest? What else happened afterwards?" Sheng Jiaoyang blinked her eyes, seemingly confused and full of curiosity.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining didn’t get mad and smiled instead. He unhurriedly walked down the stairs and only stopped when he was a step away from her, leaving half an arm’s worth of distance between them. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt her eyelids jump and she couldn’t help moving her body backwards. She wanted to create more distance between them, but she was held back by Shen Zhining’s hand. Before she could even react, everything went black before her eyes and her breath suddenly mingled with his. In the next moment…</p> 
 <p>She let out a scream.</p> 
 <p>"Are you mad?!" Sheng Jiaoyang covered her mouth as tears welled up in her eyes due to the pain.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s lips curled upwards into a smile, seemingly in a very good mood at this moment.</p> 
 <p>"That’s only fair."</p> 
 <p>"What fairness are you talking about?" Her eyes were gleaming with tears as she tasted the traces of blood in her mouth. She licked the cut on her lip and felt like she was an innocent passerby who’d suddenly been bitten by a mad dog. She was feeling particularly aggrieved and angry at the same time.</p> 
 <p><em>What the hell is wrong with Demon King Shen? Why would he come and bite her so early in the morning?</em></p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining raised his hand to touch the scab on his lips and stared at the aggrieved and angry Sheng Jiaoyang with her hand covering her mouth. Then, he indifferently said, "That was how you bit me last night."</p> 
 <p>"…No, no way!" she said, but somehow started to doubt herself.</p> 
 <p>"Last night, you said you liked me and asked me to kiss you. I refused, so you…"</p> 
 <p>"Stop it! No need to continue…" Sheng Jiaoyang grabbed her suitcase and hurried downstairs. "I didn't hear anything. I have a plane to catch, so I have to go now. Bye!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining leaned on the handrail and watched her flee in defeat. Without knowing it, he let out a soft chuckle. He was surprised to hear himself laugh, and he suddenly felt that it was quite nice to have someone like her around.</p> 
 <p>He raised his hand and caressed the scab on his lips again, recalling the scene from last night.</p> 
 <p>At that time, she looked very pitiful as if she was begging for the last goodbye kiss of her life. "Can you give me a kiss?" At that time, a strange sensation bubbled up in his heart, but he still didn’t kiss her. Who would’ve thought that she would suddenly jump on him, her teeth consequently grazing his lower lip.</p> 
 <p>And then…</p> 
 <p>Without knowing who started it, they started kissing.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining had always been a cleanfreak, and he’d never thought that there was anything good about two people sticking to one another and kissing. He even disliked seeing others being intimate like this. However, due to yesterday’s ambiance and the inexplicable impulse he’d felt at that time, he’d unexpectedly done such a thing. He even thought that it wasn’t that bad and he didn’t dislike it.</p> 
 <p>He licked his lips. <em>If it wasn’t for the fact that she’d fallen asleep amidst their kiss, who knows what would’ve happened next?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly got in the car and sat down. Her emotions were in a mess as she thought: <em>OMG, she actually bit Boss Shen yesterday?</em></p> 
 <p>She licked her wounded lips and struggled with her tumultuous inner thoughts.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, what happened to your lips?" Zeng Huan asked when she noticed her lips.</p> 
 <p>"It’s nothing." Sheng Jiaoyang used the car’s mirror to examine her lips. She then pulled a lip balm from her bag and applied it on her mouth.</p> 
 <p>Zeng Huan sneaked a few glances at her. <em>Looks like things got intense yesterday as even her lips were bitten, tsk tsk!</em></p> 
 <p>"Did I go mad or did he go crazy?" Sheng Jiaoyang frowned and muttered under her breath. If it wasn’t for the pain reminding her, she would’ve thought that she was hallucinating.</p> 
 <p>Only one night had passed, yet Demon King Shen seemed to have turned into a different person.<span id="footnote-ref-7556"><a href="#footnote-7556">[1]</a></span></p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, are you sure you don't want me to accompany you abroad?" When they arrived at the airport, Zeng Huan helped her with her luggage.</p> 
 <p>"No, it’s fine. This time, I’m going to settle some personal matters." Sheng Jiaoyang was wearing a big mask and her voice was muffled.</p> 
 <p>"Alright then, you take care of yourself."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang took two steps and halted. She turned to Zeng Huan and said, "By the way, help me get a new pair of glasses." With that, she gave Zeng Huan some more details related to her prescription.</p> 
 <p>Today’s trip was supposed to be a sad one. After all, the man she’d loved all this while was about to get engaged to someone else. But, what had happened this morning was imprinted in her mind, so she didn’t have any spare time to think about anything else.</p> 
 <p>When she passed the security check, she was asked to take off her mask. When the security personnel inspected her, his eyes paused on her injured lips for two seconds. Seeing this, she, who’d always been thick-skinned, suddenly felt her cheeks burn with embarrassment. As soon as she passed the security check, she quickly put on her mask again.</p> 
 <p>From the moment she got on the plane, she wore a mask and didn't eat anything all the way until she got off the plane.</p> 
 <p>"Mei Niu, I've arrived."</p> 
 <p>Lina, who was driving to the engagement party, almost crashed into the road signs upon hearing this. She asked in surprise, “You’re saying that you’ve arrived in Rome?" </p> 
 <p>"Yup."</p> 
 <p>"OMG, you really are… Sigh, nevermind. Wait for me there, I'll pick you up right away."</p> 
 <p>When she saw Sheng Jiaoyang wearing a mask, Lina immediately asked, "What's the matter with you? Are you ill?" </p> 
 <p>"It’s nothing." Sheng Jiaoyang’s voice sounded a little erratic.</p> 
 <p>Lina knew Sheng Jiaoyang like the back of her hand. So, seeing the latter act like this, she knew that something must’ve happened. She put on an aggrieved expression and asked, “Is it because I kept you in the dark about Lin Yan’s engagement that you don’t want to tell me anything anymore? Especially when there’s something on your mind.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand and pinched Lina’s face. "This expression doesn’t suit you."</p> 
 <p>"So…Jiaojiao, you're not angry with me, are you?" Lina acted cute and blinked a few times.</p> 
 <p>"How could I be angry with you? Alright, I'll show you in the car later. "</p> 
 <p>Once they were sitting in the car, Sheng Jiaoyang took off her mask.</p> 
 <p>Lina’s eyes instantly widened. She extended her hand to hold Sheng Jiaoyang’s face closer and examined her face left, right, and centre. "What’s going on? Did you kiss someone last night?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang leaned against the back of the chair, covered her eyes with her hands, and sighed.</p> 
 <p>"I don't know."</p> 
 <p>"What? What happened? Have you been taken advantage of?" Lina’s expression turned solemn as she asked.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sighed again. "No."</p> 
 <p>Hearing her say no, Lina let out a sigh of relief and started the sports car.</p> 
 <p>"I think I was the one who took advantage of that person…" Sheng Jiaoyang continued.</p> 
 <p>Lina drove the sports car out of the parking space and curiously asked, "Why do you say that?"</p> 
 <p>"The wound on my lips was Shen Zhining’s doing."</p> 
 <p>Bang! The sports car rear-ended an SUV.</p> 
 <p>Shock was written all over Lina’s face. She couldn’t care less about her car at this moment and swiftly turned to look at Sheng Jiaoyang, enunciating each word as she asked, “You’re saying that Demon King Shen was the one who bit your lips?!" </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded and said, "I drank a little too much last night. You know that I’m currently living with him. This morning, he suddenly bit me and said that it’s only fair to return the favour. He also said that I told him that I liked him and asked him to kiss me…"</p> 
 <p>Speaking up to this point, Sheng Jiaoyang felt a bit awkward, but she continued, "He said that he refused, so I jumped on him and bit him."</p> 
 <p>"No way!" Lina exclaimed, reacting like she’d just heard of a full-scale drama.</p> 
 <p>"His…his lips were indeed wounded."</p> 
 <p>The two of them could only stare at each other, feeling utterly speechless.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, you'd better give up drinking from now on!" Lina earnestly urged after a while.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang held her forehead and sullenly responded, "Sigh, I think I should too…"</p> 
 <p><em>She’d only gotten drunk twice, and she ended up provoking Demon King Shen both times. The first time, she’d broken into his bathroom when he was taking a shower, and the second time, she’d jumped on him and bit his lips. She didn’t dare to think of what would happen the next time as the consequences would definitely be more exciting than adventurous.</em></p> 
 <p><em>So, it was best for her to quit drinking!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s current mood was like that of a meat lover who was forced to eat vegetables every day. Back then, she, who was fond of wine tasting, couldn’t drink due to her poor health and had no choice but to refrain herself from touching wine as much as possible. Of course, she was now feeling sullen in her heart. She currently possessed a healthy body and could drink whatever wine she wanted and as much as she wanted. Yet, she had to force herself to stop drinking alcohol…this was the same as asking a foodie to not touch food. Thinking of this, she felt all the more bitter. </p> 
 <p>"I’ll get off and have a look." Lina got out of the car.</p> 
 <p>The front of her car was a little deformed due to the impact, but luckily, only a little paint was wiped off the back of the SUV.</p> 
 <p>As she was in a hurry, Lina didn't stay long. She took a picture of the scene, left a note behind the windscreen wiper in front of the SUV’s driver's seat, and drove off to the hotel where the engagement party was being held.</p>
