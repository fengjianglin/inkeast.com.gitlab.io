<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Regarding the abnormal rules given by the program team, Xiao Yang’s team suffered quite a bit.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was surprised at this requirement. Compared to the superior treatment obtained by the winning party, their treatment was as different as heaven and earth.</p> 
 <p>However, she didn’t regret her willful actions in the game at all.</p> 
 <p>But, some of the other team members were quite regretful. For instance, the girl who’d complained about Sheng Jiaoyang during the game. Also Xiao Yang, who didn’t trust Sheng Jiaoyang, and those who’d just watched.</p> 
 <p>Even so, since things had already come to this point, there was no point in having regrets.</p> 
 <p>After Zhuo Yiyan started the timer, the first group of five girls entered the wholesale market, each person followed by a cameraman.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was in the first group to enter. Although she partially ran into the market, her expression wasn’t as flustered as the others.</p> 
 <p>Ten minutes was a really short time, and it would take more than ten minutes to finish strolling around the market. Therefore, for such a brief period of time, the contestants would have to focus on the items that they wanted to choose. In that case, they would have to thoroughly consider what style they wanted to go for before entering the market.</p> 
 <p>Not to mention, it would be hard to try on a dress in ten minutes, let alone find the rest of the items that they’d need.</p> 
 <p>When the first group of five contestants entered the market, they wandered aimlessly like headless flies. Two contestants who had weak hearts immediately started crying, while another two were on the verge of collapsing.</p> 
 <p>Compared to them, Sheng Jiaoyang was much calmer as she unhurriedly walked past various women’s clothing stores. Just as the cameraman following her was about to let her know that one-third of the time limit had already passed, she turned and entered a pajama store.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman was shocked for two seconds before he followed her in.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, Sheng Jiaoyang was holding a man’s black nightgown made from silk.</p> 
 <p>Please note that it was a man's nightgown!</p> 
 <p>The cameraman was once again shocked, and the camera motionlessly focused on the nightgown in Sheng Jiaoyang’s hands for a few seconds.</p> 
 <p>The shopkeeper was a young woman. When she saw the camera, she immediately knew that they were shooting a show. She quickly combed her hair, and asked Sheng Jiaoyang with a smile like the spring wind, “Are you here to buy something for your boyfriend? You have a good eye! The item in your hands just arrived. This design is quite popular recently as it’s simple yet stylish. Your boyfriend would definitely look handsome wearing that. Just have a look at the texture of the fabric, how smooth it is under the light. Furthermore, its colour won’t fade no matter how many times you wash it. Pretty girl, do you want to buy one?”</p> 
 <p>“How much?”</p> 
 <p>“Forty four!” The shopkeeper grinned.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her eyebrows. “On the price tag it says that it’s only forty two. Are you sure it’s forty four?”</p> 
 <p>Although she didn’t care about the price difference, she didn’t like to be seen as gullible.</p> 
 <p>The shopkeeper’s smile stiffened, and she seemed embarrassed as she replied, “Oh, I must’ve remembered it wrongly. It’s forty two, forty two.”</p> 
 <p>“This store should give a discount as it seems quite large compared to others in this wholesale market.”</p> 
 <p>The expression on the shopkeeper’s face froze, and she no longer dared to underestimate this young girl. “Then, tell me the price you want?”</p> 
 <p>“Twenty eight. If you want to sell it, then help me wrap it up.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang knew that she could get it even cheaper, but she was too lazy to argue, and she also didn’t have any time to spare. So, she gave a price that wouldn’t be rejected.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, the shopkeeper took out a bag and wrapped up the nightgown without demur.</p> 
 <p>As one hand took the cash, the other passed over the bag. The shopkeeper checked the money, smiled cordially, then waved her hand. “Does the pretty lady want to choose a set for herself, maybe? There are many different styles…”</p> 
 <p>“No, thank you.” Sheng Jiaoyang turned and left the store.</p> 
 <p>“Please come back any time~” The joyous voice of the shopkeeper rang out from behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang continued heading for the next store.</p> 
 <p>Like this, the ten minutes quickly passed.</p> 
 <p>When the five contestants returned to the bus, they were the centre of attention.</p> 
 <p>“Quickly tell us! What is the situation like inside the market?” the second group of contestants, who were ready to enter the market, anxiously asked them.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t ask me. Even now, I'm still shocked!” A contestant shook her head as she forced a smile.</p> 
 <p>Two other contestants were engrossed with drinking water, not bothering to answer them.</p> 
 <p>Another one said, “When you guys go in, I advise you not to wander. Just enter the first store you see or else you’ll have no time to choose and try on the dress.”</p> 
 <p>Xiao Yang looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, who had the calmest expression, and quickly asked, “Jiaojiao, what about you?”</p> 
 <p>“She’s right. Don’t think that the next store will have something better, because you don’t have enough time to be picky.” Sheng Jiaoyang paused before continuing, “If you want to buy a dress, enter from the left-hand side of the door. The right-hand side entrance is where the bags are. The innermost section is shoes and other accessories.”</p> 
 <p>Undoubtedly, Sheng Jiaoyang’s advice was helpful to the contestants who’d enter next. The way they looked at her changed due to this.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, thank you!” Xiao Yang exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shrugged as she walked back to her seat.</p> 
 <p>“What did you buy?” Luo Yi looked curiously at the bags in Sheng Jiaoyang’s hands.</p> 
 <p>“You’ll know tonight.” A corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth raised to keep the other girl guessing.</p> 
 <p>“Fine,” Luo Yi sighed, feigning disappointment.</p> 
 <p>By the time the two remaining groups had finished buying their stuff, nearly half an hour had passed.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan didn’t ask how Xiao Yang’s team went buying their outfits. Instead, he took everyone to a restaurant and had a sumptuous lunch.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, everyone returned to the villa.</p> 
 <p>Once they’d returned, Zhuo Yiyan announced that the garden party would start at 7 pm before disappearing.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the opening show a week ago, when makeup artists had helped the contestants, the girls were now required to do their own makeup for the party that night.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t matter if you couldn’t put on makeup, as someone else could help you. This time, it was to test a person’s ability to communicate.</p> 
 <p>Don’t think that having communication skills wasn’t important. Having good relationships with other people was a talent as no one could work alone to achieve success.</p> 
 <p>As everyone began to ponder their evening makeup, only Sheng Jiaoyang seemed to be completely unconcerned. As soon as they’d returned to the villa, she immediately went for a nap.</p> 
 <p>When Luo Yi and Pu Mingyu went back to their room, they saw that Sheng Jiaoyang had already rolled herself into a ball and fallen asleep. Both of them looked at each other in dismay; helplessness and envy on their faces.</p> 
 <p>If they were to go to bed now, they wouldn’t be able to sleep. When they thought about how they would be judged on their outfits and style later that night, they were both nervous and excited. How could they sleep?!</p> 
 <p>As night gradually approached, everyone became restless as they carefully applied their makeup and styled their hair. Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang finally woke up, utterly refreshed.</p> 
 <p>“You’re finally awake! Quick, quick, there’s still an hour and a half to get ready, so hurry and get up. Do you want us to help you with your makeup?” asked Luo Yi, who just happened to enter the room.</p> 
 <p>“I can do it myself, but I want to borrow your makeup,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied while rubbing her short fluffy hair.</p> 
 <p>“Sure, just use it.” Luo Yi grabbed her cosmetic bag from the cupboard and handed it over to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you!” Sheng Jiaoyang accepted the makeup bag, placing it with the stuff that she’d bought in the morning. Then, she selected a change of clothes from her suitcase and left the room.</p> 
 <p>“Ehh, where are you going?” Luo Yi asked quickly, feeling that something was amiss.</p> 
 <p>“To take a bath!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi supported her forehead with her hand. <em>Doesn’t this girl feel worried at all?</em></p> 
 <p>Time steadily passed, gradually inching closer to 7 pm. When the hour arrived, all the lights in the garden lit up.</p> 
 <p>A cheerful violin tune started playing, indicating that the party was about to begin.</p>
