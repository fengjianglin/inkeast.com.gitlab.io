 <p>Even if the other party came alone, the guards protecting the manor still stayed vigilant. They pointed their guns at the man when he got closer to the gate, but they were soon commanded to lower their guns through the wireless earbuds embedded in their ears.</p> 
 <p>Back in the SUV, Sheng Jiaoyang was suddenly faced with a fragile and vulnerable Lin Yan, and she did not have the heart to reprimand him for his decision to wipe her memory.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I forgive you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang did not know how significant the two years of memories that she had lost were, thus she was able to easily forgive him.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan smiled brightly at her words.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan’s appearance was so attractive that he could even make someone as picky as Sheng Jiaoyang fall in love with him. In the past, if Sheng Jiaoyang saw Lin Yan smile like that, she would have fallen head over heels for him. But now, the scene was only a feast for her eyes, but it did not make her heart thump furiously in her chest, or give her the feeling of having butterflies in her stomach.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao,” Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly heard a soft voice calling out for her.</p> 
 <p>She turned around, and she saw a man standing next to the car.</p> 
 <p>That man was Shen Zhining. But it was not the Shen Zhining from her memories.</p> 
 <p>He seemed to have lost that coldness which pushed her away from him. Though he still had a cold and angry expression, the warmth in his eyes seemed capable of causing her to melt.</p> 
 <p>“Come home with me.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang became more curious about the memories she had lost. She wanted to know what she had gone through to bring the both of them together into a relationship.</p> 
 <p>She only came back to her senses when she felt Lin Yan’s tight grip on her.</p> 
 <p>“Why must I go with you?” Sheng Jiaoyang always tried to avoid him whenever she went to Aureate Manor, and when she could not avoid him, she always felt uncomfortable around him. Thus, she dared not imagine the situation where both of them were living under the same roof.</p> 
 <p>“What did you say?”</p> 
 <p>The anger that billowed out from him caused Sheng Jiaoyang to flinch.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan put his arm around her, “Don’t be afraid of him. With me around, he will never be able to force you into doing anything ever again.”</p> 
 <p><em>Bam!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was startled. She saw him land a huge punch on the side of the car window, and his unending rage left her very nervous. Her traumatic memories of being bullied as a child were resurfacing again.</p> 
 <p>“Get out of the car. Don’t make me repeat what I just said.”</p> 
 <p>The current emotional state of Shen Zhining was akin to a stormy sea. He should not have let her roam around alone. It had only been a few days, but she had already rekindled her love for Lin Yan. If he was the same person as he was two years ago, he would not have wasted time on such nonsense, but forcefully taken her away instead.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, stay in the car. I’ll talk to him.” Lin Yan patted Sheng Jiaoyang lightly on the shoulder.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to say something, but when she felt a fierce glare directed at her, her mind became a complete blank.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan said that the man had forcefully come between them. Based on Shen Zhining’s actions, it was tough not to believe Lin Yan’s words. But Lina had also told her that she shouldn’t believe anything that Lin Yan said either.</p> 
 <p><em>What happened in the last two years?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t get to delve too deeply into her thoughts before she saw Shen Zhining land a punch on Lin Yan. Her eyes widened, and she hurriedly alighted the car to stop Shen Zhining before he swung his fists at Lin Yan again.</p> 
 <p>“Why are you beating him?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt her heart break when she saw a bruise appear on Lin Yan’s delicate face. To her, it was almost as if a famous and rare piece of art was just damaged. She was just about to go and care for Lin Yan, when Shen Zhining grabbed her hand instead.</p> 
 <p>“Let go.”</p> 
 <p>She turned around to face Shen Zhining, but when she saw his face distorted with extreme rage, her heart skipped a beat. However, when she recalled how he had just beaten Lin Yan up for no reason, she lifted her chin up and stared straight at him as she rebutted, “Can’t you just talk things through? Only reckless people resort to violence.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you opposing me because of him?” All of a sudden, the anger on Shen Zhining receded like the tide, and he now looked extremely calm.</p> 
 <p>It looked like the kind of calm that came right before a huge storm.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan had already stood up. He held Sheng Jiaoyang’s other arm, and he tried to pull her behind his back, but she did not budge at all.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang frowned, “Are you guys trying to split me into two halves?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining threw Lin Yan a cold look. Although he did not say anything, it was obvious that he wanted Lin Yan to let go.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan loosened his grip. At the same time, he let out a painful moan.</p> 
 <p>His painful moan instantly attracted Sheng Jiaoyang’s attention. She struggled out of Shen Zhining’s grip and hurried to Lin Yan’s side. “Brother Lin Yan, are you alright? Do you want to see the doctor?”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao!” When she heard the cold voice coming from behind her, and when she saw the sight of Lin Yan frowning in pain, anger surged out from Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>She turned around and stared at him, “You only know to bully others.”</p> 
 <p>“Bully?” Shen Zhining looked as if he just heard a joke, “You’re heartbroken that I beat him up?”</p> 
 <p>“I like him. Shouldn’t I be heartbroken?” Sheng Jiaoyang rebutted.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, Shen Zhining’s expression had changed into something scary, and he drew closer to Sheng Jiaoyang, “Say that again!”</p> 
 <p>Startled, Sheng Jiaoyang took a step back, and she nearly knocked into Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Shen, please leave. As Jiaojiao’s beloved, I will definitely take good care of her.” Lin Yan wrapped his arm around her. The expressions on Lin Yan and Shen Zhining’s faces were polar opposites. One was as bright as the heavens, and the other was as dark as hell. Lin Yan had on a gentle smile that reminded people of a spring breeze, but his tone was sharp and straightforward.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s hands had balled up into fists. If not for his fear of harming Sheng Jiaoyang, he would have long landed a punch on Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>He stared at Sheng Jiaoyang for a moment and asked, “Are you certain that you want to be with him?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang did not give an immediate answer, for her cautious character prevented her from making a decision when she had yet to make clear of the current situation.</p> 
 <p>A thought suddenly appeared in Lin Yan’s mind, and he turned to Sheng Jiaoyang, “Jiaojiao, you said before that you wanted to travel all over the world with me, remember?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang tried to recall her past memories, only to realize that everything related to Lin Yan was a blur, even though she thought she would have remembered these things clearly. She felt awkward since she could not remember the incident Lin Yan was referring to, but it must have happened before, otherwise Lin Yan would not bring it up.</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine if you can’t remember it, as long as I can,” Lin Yan said considerately, “In the future, I’ll accompany you, wherever you go.”</p> 
 <p><em>In the future, I’ll accompany you, wherever you go…</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt that this phrase was strangely familiar, but no matter how much she tried to recall where it came from, she could not.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining suppressed his anger and asked her again, “Grandfather Yang is still waiting for you back home. Are you really not going to return with me?”</p> 
 <p>“Grandfather…” Sheng Jiaoyang was about to ask why her grandfather was at Shen Zhining’s house, but he was immediately cut off by Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, if you wish to see your grandfather, I’ll go with you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around to look at Lin Yan. With how close they were, she felt herself being sucked into those deep and charming eyes. She could not help but nod, “Okay.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s face was now completely dark.</p>
