 <p>“It's you!” Sheng Shiyun shouted angrily.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled strangely as she replied, “It's me.”</p> 
 <p>Those who didn't know the relationship between the pair would’ve thought they had a good relationship based on Sheng Jiaoyang’s smile. For example, Liang Dahui assumed that they knew each other already.</p> 
 <p>“So, you guys already know each other, that's good. Jiaojiao, hang out with Shiyun often. We’re all family here. When you're free, you should visit each other,” Liang Dahui said.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed, her meaning unclear.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun's complexion worsened as she stared at the person smiling cheerfully in front of her. “What did you say to Lin Yu that day?”</p> 
 <p>The onlookers were all startled.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked up, her finger touching her chin briefly to form a thinking expression as she slowly said, “What did I say to him? I have to think about it.”</p> 
 <p>Her gaze circled the surroundings before she continued, “My memory isn't too good, so I don't remember.”</p> 
 <p>This scoundrel made Sheng Shiyun irritated. She’d originally thought that no one in this world could make her angrier than Sheng Jiaoyang, but she then encountered this person who wasn't the least bit inferior. How could there be so many people that she hates in this world?!</p> 
 <p>“Are you two okay?” Liang Dahui finally saw that something wasn’t right.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang restrained her smile as she said, “Aunt, I don't have that many family members, and I'm not so idle that I’d bring irrelevant people out to play. I'm not opening up a kindergarten.”</p> 
 <p>“You…” Before Liang Dahui could finish speaking, Sheng Jiaoyang had walked away with Lina.</p> 
 <p>Liang Dahui was furious. She didn't say anything to Sheng Shiyun, and instead immediately seized Xu Ze to start complaining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Shiyun's hands clenched into fists. Behind the so-called high society's kind and gentle image, they were all filled with disdain and contempt. She vowed that one day, she’d force them to respect her!</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang and Lina entered the villa and went to the studio where the soundproofing was the best. They then made themselves comfortable on the sofa and started chatting.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, you probably remember, right? That time at the airport, I hit a parked car while I was parking my car.”</p> 
 <p>“Of course, I remember. Did you…kiss the car owner?” A gossipy light began burning in Sheng Jiaoyang's eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, it's him,” Lina affirmed.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned her head and looked at Lina teasingly. “Does that count as an affair?”</p> 
 <p>Lina rolled her eyes. “At the start, he invited me out to talk about compensation for the damage to the car. After that, I came across him again when I went to a bar with the cast, so he stayed to play a game with us.”</p> 
 <p>She paused for a while. “The person who lost had to kiss the person beside them for a minute.”</p> 
 <p>“Woah, playing with such huge stakes!” Sheng Jiaoyang exclaimed in shock. “But, how do you explain the mark on your neck?”</p> 
 <p>“What else? After kissing, we felt a connection and entered a private room.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang used a ‘turns out you're this kind of person’ gaze to look at Lina.</p> 
 <p>“We didn't do the last step.”</p> 
 <p>Lina blinked before sighing. “I can't overcome the ridge in my heart.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang reached out her hands to hold her and asked, “Do you want to try starting over with George?”</p> 
 <p>Lina became silent.</p> 
 <p>“No matter what, if you don't try, you won't know the end. Now you’ve suffered because you can't take a step forward or backward. Go try it out. If you guys are destined, you won't lose anything doing this. If it's not suitable, then you should completely abandon all thoughts of reconciliation.”</p> 
 <p>Lina listened to her words, the hesitation visible on her face gradually dissipating. She stood up and paced inside the studio and her spirit became more stable. She suddenly turned around and looked at Sheng Jiaoyang. “You're right.”</p> 
 <p>Lina was very close to the drawing board, so when she abruptly turned around, it caused the cloth on the drawing board to fall.</p> 
 <p>When Lina picked up the cloth, she saw the drawing on the drawing board out of the corner of her eye. She instantly froze in the act of picking up the cloth, leaving her hand suspended in the air. Her gaze was sharp as she stared at Sheng Jiaoyang and asked, “What's with this? Confess honestly!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang leaned her forehead on her hand, and she felt slightly guilty as she said, “I couldn't resist your brother’s beauty, it's really a feast for the eyes. It's very hard to stop myself from…”</p> 
 <p>“You, you…” Lina pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang, feeling quite resentful that she couldn’t meet her expectations. “Could it be that he came to find you?”</p> 
 <p>According to Lina's understanding of Sheng Jiaoyang, Lina knew that once Sheng Jiaoyang decided to date Demon King Shen, she’d definitely start to forget her feelings for Lin Yan. Since Sheng Jiaoyang had already rejected him, she wouldn't do things that would implicate herself.</p> 
 <p>“Yes,” Sheng Jiaoyang admitted.</p> 
 <p>Lina walked over, and using both of her hands to support herself on the sofa's backrest beside Sheng Jiaoyang, she questioned, “Why did he look for you? Does he want you to be with him?”</p> 
 <p>“This time, you're wrong. He came to tell me that we'll always be friends.”</p> 
 <p>“Friends? Hehe!” Lina laughed coldly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang. “You don't believe it? He said that he was serious.”</p> 
 <p>Lina reached out her hands to pinch Sheng Jiaoyang’s cheek, helplessly saying, “What use is it whether I believe it or not? The important thing is whether you believe it or not.”</p> 
 <p>“I felt like he's serious. Moreover, he left immediately after telling me and didn't come to find me again. He's so ambitious, he couldn't be tangled up in the love affairs between a man and a woman.”</p> 
 <p>“Then, what about you? Does your heart still yearn to be with him?”</p> 
 <p>“If I say no, would you believe me? However, since I made the decision, I definitely won’t turn back.”</p> 
 <p>“Really?” Lina raised her eyebrow, indicating some suspicion. “You scoundrel! You used to be so greedy for his beauty. If the day ever came that he asks you to be with him, would you turn back?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt amused by Lina's words. She teasingly shoved Lina as she smiled and said, “Don't tease me anymore. Your brother isn’t the kind of person that would ask me, even if he likes me.” Just like how, even though she likes Lin Yan, she’d never beg for his love. They were actually very similar as the dignity in their bones wouldn't easily allow them to be meek and subservient.</p> 
 <p>Lina wanted to agree with her words, however…</p> 
 <p>“If you’ve already made up your mind, why did you draw him?” Lina pointed towards the drawing.</p> 
 <p>“Huh? Didn't I already say it? It’s very hard to prohibit myself from drawing, and for an artist, it’s nearly impossible to resist drawing beautiful things. ”</p> 
 <p>Lina stared at Sheng Jiaoyang blankly. “Then, can you stand to rip it up?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the painting, slightly unwilling. “Each painting contains the feelings of the artist and is comparable to the artist's own children. I really couldn't do it, even if you asked me.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you unwilling to part with the drawing or unwilling to part with him?”</p> 
 <p>“Fine fine, it's fine if you take it away.” Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand to rub an itchy spot on Lina's back.</p> 
 <p>Lina also rubbed her back. The two people were still arguing when someone knocked on the door.</p> 
 <p>“I'll get it.” Lina stood up and walked towards the door to open it.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also stood up to straighten her hair and clothes.</p> 
 <p>“Who is it? Ah, Dem…” The words ‘Demon King Shen’ almost escaped Lina's mouth before she quickly stopped.</p> 
 <p>“We’re preparing for a group picture now, so you guys should come down.”</p> 
 <p>“Okay.”</p> 
 <p>After waiting for him to go away, Lina turned around and said to Sheng Jiaoyang, “You're done for.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang's eyebrows jumped as she asked, “What happened?”</p> 
 <p>“Just now, it was Demon King Shen at the door.” Lina was obviously gloating as she said, “He saw your drawing of Lin Yan.”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang flopped onto the sofa, pretending that she’d died.</p> 
 <p>“Okay, let's go, we have to join the group photo,” Lina urged.</p> 
 <p>Upon reaching the yard, they saw that everyone was busy taking a group photo on the beautifully decorated stage.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang went over with Lina, and together, they took a few group photos.</p> 
 <p>Now that they’d finished taking the photos, the wedding ceremony was about to end.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang then approached Sheng Xun after quickly telling Lina her plan. “Mr Sheng, let’s talk.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun looked at her before nodding.</p> 
 <p>Liang Xiaohui and Sheng Shiyun’s expressions immediately changed. In Sheng Shiyun’s heart, she’d already established this person as her enemy. At this moment, when she saw Xu Jiaojiao wanting to talk to her dad alone, she felt that something bad would happen.</p> 
 <p>However, Sheng Xun didn't care about their obvious unhappiness and headed to an empty corner with Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“What did you want to say to me?” Sheng Xun asked.</p> 
 <p>“I wanted to remind you, that when you go back to carefully pack up Jiaoyang's things, Grandfather will pick them up in two days.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun furrowed his brows and quickly said, “I’m Jiaoyang's father, I have the right to keep her things.”</p> 
 <p>“Keeping it and giving it away to other people? Or, could it be that you’ve already given it all away?” Sheng Jiaoyang sneered.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?” Sheng Xun's gaze darkened.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe,” Sheng Jiaoyang laughed coldly. “Both the crystal head ornament on Sheng Shiyun, and the jade bracelet on her mother's hand, belong to Jiaoyang. That crystal head ornament was given to Jiaoyang on her 19th birthday by Grandmother Andy; there's a mark above it. As for the jade bracelet, that was bought by Grandfather in an auction as Jiaoyang's coming-of-age present. Do you want to call Grandfather over to confirm it?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun's complexion became increasingly worse. On one hand he was vexed, and on the other he questioned, “How did you know?”</p> 
 <p>“In this world, I’m the one who understands Jiaoyang the best. Don't vainly attempt to keep her things. Every single item that’s worth something is registered, and she left a will. Upon leaving this world, all her things are to be handed to her grandfather and left for him to manage. No matter how many things you’ve given out, you must get it all back over the next two days. If anything is damaged, you’ll be paying the appraisal price.”</p> 
 <p>After saying what she wanted, Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and walked away before Sheng Xun could reply.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun stood frozen in place, his rage almost swallowing his reason.</p> 
 <p>“Husband, let's go home?” Seeing that Sheng Xun hadn’t moved for a long time, Liang Xiaohui and Sheng Shiyun approached him.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Xun's fiery gaze shot towards them. His glare switched between the jade bracelet on Liang Xiaohui's hand, and the head ornament that matched Sheng Shiyun’s outfit.</p> 
 <p>“W-what's wrong?” Liang Xiaohui's heart trembled.</p> 
 <p>“I only want to ask you one thing. Does that bracelet belong to Jiaoyang?” Sheng Xun stared at Liang Xiaohui.</p> 
 <p>Liang Xiaohui started panicking, but she was sure that after Sheng Jiaoyang had returned to the country, Sheng Xun had hardly seen Sheng Jiaoyang. He shouldn’t know what kind of jewellery she had. Her gaze flickered as she said, “My mother gave this to me.”</p> 
 <p>The look in Sheng Xun's eyes darkened, but he didn't call out her lie. On the contrary, his voice was gentle as he said, “Let's go home.”</p> 
 <p>Liang Xiaohui and Sheng Shiyun released a sigh of relief.</p>
