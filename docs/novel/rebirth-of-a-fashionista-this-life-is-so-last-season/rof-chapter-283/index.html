 <p>Tang Feng obviously wanted to get Zhou Yilin drunk!</p> 
 <p>If Zhou Yilin was so easy to fool, she wouldn't be Zhou Yilin. She went to the bathroom and threw up in there. She also soberly sent a message to Manager Lin to instruct him to stay sober to take good care of An Xiaotian.</p> 
 <p>When she returned to her seat, she was offered two more drinks. Afterwards, she lay down on the table and pretended to be drunk.</p> 
 <p>"You guys go on and continue eating. Yilin seems to be very drunk, so I'll take her home to let her have a good rest. You can continue partying as much as you want tonight. Find me for reimbursement tomorrow." Tang Feng seized Zhou Yilin with one hand and supported her as they walked out of the private room.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Ouyang Yi walked out of another private room in the back corridor to answer a call.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he looked up, he saw a man holding Zhou Yilin near the elevator. At this moment, he didn’t hear what the other party was saying anymore on the other end of the line. He subconsciously followed them. Although Zhou Yilin was an abominable woman, he didn't want anything bad to happen to her.</p> 
 <p>Just when Ouyang Yi was about to step forth to stop them, he suddenly stopped in his tracks upon witnessing the scene in front of him.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin, who was originally drunk and staggering, suddenly pushed Tang Feng away.</p> 
 <p>"You're not drunk?" Tang Feng asked in surprise.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin coldly stared at Tang Feng before walking to the elevator and pressing the going down button, but Tang Feng grabbed her and pushed her to the wall. He inched closer and wanted to force a kiss.</p> 
 <p>"Ouch!" Tang Feng screeched and jumped away while holding the tip of his shoe.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin raised her chin and coldly snorted. In the next moment, a ‘ding’ was heard and the elevator doors opened. She then leisurely stepped into the elevator.</p> 
 <p>As the elevator doors were about to close, Ouyang Yi swiftly stepped inside.</p> 
 <p>"That was a really good show," Ouyang Yi sarcastically remarked.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin, however, didn’t look at him or speak.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi was inexplicably angry at being ignored. "Didn’t you say that you like me? Is this how you should act towards a person you like?"</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin turned around and this time she pushed Ouyang Yi to the elevator wall. She was wearing high heels so she was nearly as tall as Ouyang Yi. They were so close that the tip of their noses faintly touched.</p> 
 <p>"You…" Ouyang Yi suddenly didn’t know what to say. He raised his hand and tried to push her away but he heard her say, "I miss you." Her expression was no longer aloof, and genuine emotions could be seen in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi was in a trance and he thought for a moment that he’d seen Zhong Lin. However, he knew very well that she was Zhou Yilin, and not his Zhong Lin.</p> 
 <p><em>Ding!</em> The elevator doors opened.</p> 
 <p>"Wow~" Two girls who were about to enter the elevator exclaimed when they saw the scene in front of them.</p> 
 <p><em>A beautiful woman actually had a handsome guy against the wall!</em></p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin instantly sobered up. She turned and staggered out of the elevator, striding out of the building as if she was fleeing in defeat.</p> 
 <p>The two girls waiting for the elevator saw Ouyang Yi walking out of the elevator in a leisurely manner, so they couldn't help but ask, "Hey Handsome, aren’t you going to chase after your girlfriend?" </p> 
 <p>"She's not my girlfriend." Ouyang Yi gloomily replied.</p> 
 <p>The two girls looked at each other and saw a look of understanding in each other's eyes. <em>There’s more to this than meets the eye.</em></p> 
 <p>After Zhou Yilin left the building, she walked aimlessly on the sidewalk. When she saw a bar, she turned and walked inside. This was a quiet bar, without noisy music and dancing crowds, and the atmosphere was rather peaceful.</p> 
 <p>She sat at the counter of the bar, drinking one glass after another.</p> 
 <p>"Miss, Miss? We are about to close. Please call a friend to pick you up." The waiter at the bar nudged her.</p> 
 <p>She looked up at the waiter in a drunken state, but her gaze was still somewhat sober.</p> 
 <p>When she picked up her phone, she saw the name ‘Ouyang Yi’ at the top of her call records.</p> 
 <p>"Ouyang Yi, I'm drunk."</p> 
 <p>"What does that have anything to do with me?"</p> 
 <p>"Come here and pick me up."</p> 
 <p>"Heh, Zhou Yilin, you’re overestimating yourself, aren’t you?"</p> 
 <p>"If you don't come, you’ll never see Zhong Lin again."</p> 
 <p>"…Where are you?"</p> 
 <p>There was a victorious look on Zhou Yilin's face.</p> 
 <p>When Ouyang Yi walked into the bar with a gloomy aura, he saw Zhou Yilin lying on the counter of the bar.</p> 
 <p>"Hey, let's go." Ouyang Yi coarsely nudged Zhou Yilin.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin looked up. When she saw that it was him, she beamed at him. "You came!"</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi froze for a second. <em>Her smile is very sweet, just like Zhong Lin’s.</em></p> 
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Yilin pounced on him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned against him, staring him in the eye.</p> 
 <p>"Why don't you like me? I look exactly the same as Zhong Lin. She doesn't like to dress up and isn’t as beautiful as me. Why don't you like me?" The smile on Zhou Yilin's face disappeared and she had on an expression of wanting to cry but had no tears.</p> 
 <p>"No matter how much you look like her, I can't like you," Ouyang Yi affirmatively responded.</p> 
 <p>"Hahaha…" Zhou Yilin retreated with a wry smile and staggered outside.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi frowned and followed her.</p> 
 <p>After boarding Ouyang Yi's car, Zhou Yilin said, "Take me to Raphanus Courtyard." She then closed her eyes and said no more.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi swept a glance at her before starting the engine.</p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the gate of Raphanus Courtyard, Ouyang Yi extended his hand to wake Zhou Yilin up. However, before he could do so, the latter already opened her eyes and looked over at him with a complicated look in her eyes. The only thing he was sure of was that she was clear-headed at this moment.</p> 
 <p>"We’re here," he blurted out.</p> 
 <p>Before Zhou Yilin got off the car, she abruptly said, "Yin and Yang are complementary. You can't have one without the other. If you hate me, you and Zhong Lin will never be together. "</p> 
 <p>"What do you mean?"</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin said no more and stepped out of the car. She then walked to the door and inserted her keys.</p> 
 <p>"What do you mean by those words? I’m not letting you go until you clarify!" Ouyang Yi grabbed her arm.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin looked at him with a burning gaze. "You can’t find Zhong Lin, right?"</p> 
 <p>"Even if you go ransacked everywhere on the earth, you won’t be able to find her, because…" Zhou Yilin didn't give him time to interrupt and added, "I am Zhong Lin. If I don't want her to come out, you’ll never see her again!"</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi was shocked. He couldn't believe her words.</p> 
 <p>"No, Zhong Lin's feet…"</p> 
 <p>"I just happened to be injured that day."</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, Zhou Yilin closed the door in his face.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi returned to the car, but he didn’t drive away. He couldn’t calm his emotions even after a long time. Some details that he didn’t pay attention to before suddenly resurfaced in his mind.</p> 
 <p>When they spent their vacation at the coast, he once said, "When we get married, let’s go live abroad, far away from Zhou Yilin." At that time, Zhong Lin's expression seemed very strange, but he didn't think much of it. Only after recalling this did he realise that she had been acting strange since long ago.</p> 
 <p>He recovered and quickly made a phone call. "Doctor Song, I'd like to ask you a question: ‘Can a person have two completely different personalities and habits?’"</p> 
 <p>"You're talking about a split personality." Doctor Song replied.</p> 
 <p><em>Split personality?</em> A look of surprise flashed in Ouyang Yi's eyes. He licked his lower lip and hesitantly continued, "The thing is, I fell in love with a genuine, down-to-earth woman. I feel very comfortable when I’m around her. Her left hand is very nimble. When she draws, writes, holds chopsticks, she always uses her left hand. Later, I met another woman who looked exactly like her, but this woman is very iron-willed and hypocritical. She writes with her right hand like most people, and their handwriting is completely different. Their personalities are also polar opposites. However, she suddenly told me that they are the same person. So if I hate her, I can never be with the person I like."</p> 
 <p>"If that’s the case, the iron-willed one is the dominant personality."</p> 
 <p>"What can I do in this kind of situation?" Ouyang Yi frowned.</p> 
 <p>"If you still want to be with the one you like, you'll have to learn to accept all of her."</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin was about to go to work. However, she was surprised to find that Ouyang Yi's car was still parked at the gate. When she turned and closed the door behind her, Ouyang Yi stepped out of the car with a haggard look on his face, as if he hadn’t slept the entire night.</p> 
 <p>"Zhou Yilin," Ouyang Yi called out.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin turned around and looked him in the eye. Her expression remained calm as she indifferently asked, "What's the matter?"</p> 
 <p>"You're going to work?"</p> 
 <p>"Mhmm."</p> 
 <p>"I'll drive you."</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin fixed her gaze on him for a moment before getting in the car.</p> 
 <p>On the way, none of them spoke. Ouyang Yi's current mood was complicated. The conversation he had with Doctor Song last night echoed in his mind.</p> 
 <p>"What you said about accepting all of her, I can’t do that. Otherwise, I'll feel like I'm dating two different people at the same time."</p> 
 <p>"But they are the same person. Only, one shows the good side while the other the bad side. It’s just like a celebrity who looks bright and beautiful underneath the spotlight, but behind the scenes, they smoke, drink, scratch their feet and pick their nose. Will true fans give up chasing their favourite star because of their vulgar behavior? As a matter of fact, they won’t. Those who give up aren’t true fans. Everyone has many facets. If you can only accept one of them, you'd better give up."</p> 
 <p>Doctor Song's words enlightened him. He decided to get to know Zhou Yilin all over again. For Zhong Lin’s sake, he’d decided to accept the detestable Zhou Yilin.</p> 
 <p>When they arrived at the company, Zhou Yilin thanked him and got off the car. She then proceeded towards the office building.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi lowered the window and called out, "Zhou Yilin." </p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin didn’t stop, acting as if she hadn’t heard anything.</p> 
 <p>"Let's try dating."</p> 
 <p>It was rush hour now so there were a lot of people in the vicinity. All the onlookers looked over, including people from Zhou Yilin's department.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin paused in her tracks for a moment before walking into the office building without looking back.</p> 
 <p>It went without saying, everyone in the company soon learned about this. Zhou Hua specifically called Zhou Yilin to his office and told her to seize this opportunity and so on.</p> 
 <p>Zhou Yilin was also mocked by Tang Feng. He insinuated that she was ‘playing up to people of power and influence’. To which she softly replied, "If you have the ability, you can also put yourself under the patronage of a bigwig." </p> 
 <p>Tang Feng was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>After work, Zhou Yilin left the office building and saw Ouyang Yi leaning against his car.</p> 
 <p>Ouyang Yi opened the car door and took out a bunch of roses from the seat. He held the flowers in front of Zhou Yilin.</p> 
 <p>"Do me the honor, let’s have dinner together."</p>
