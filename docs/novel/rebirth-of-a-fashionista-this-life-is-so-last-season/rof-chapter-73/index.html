<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“You’re telling me that I’m ugly and not as fit as you?” Sheng Jiaoyang was half a head taller than Daisy, so she took advantage of her height to look down at the latter in a dominant manner.</p> 
 <p>Daisy raised her head and arrogantly stared back at her. She then snorted and asked, “Isn’t that obvious?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smirked and pointed at the indifferent Shen Zhining, triumphantly retorting, “But…he likes me anyway!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s because he’s blind!” Daisy replied angrily.</p> 
 <p>“But…you like this blind man, so what should I call you then?” Sheng Jiaoyang paused for a moment and added, “Amniotic fluid must’ve entered your brain when you were still in your mother’s womb…”</p> 
 <p>Daisy blanked out for a moment, and as soon as she recovered, she angrily roared, “You b*tch, what did you just say?!”</p> 
 <p>“It was exactly what you heard!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sneered. “Also, don’t call others ‘b*tch’ at the drop of a hat. Otherwise, you’ll give others the impression that people from the Stanley Family are very ill-mannered!”</p> 
 <p>Daisy was so angry that she raised her hand to slap Sheng Jiaoyang in the face.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, who’d guarded against her all this time, immediately ran to Shen Zhining’s side and coyly whined, “Honey, she’s going to hit me!”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining’s mouth twitched upon hearing this. <em>He didn’t expect this girl to be so good at acting. If it weren’t for the fact that he had to act along to make his story believable, he would’ve asked Weinan to throw this girl out long ago.</em></p> 
 <p>“Ning, how could you like a girl like her?!” As Daisy pointed at Sheng Jiaoyang, her hand trembled uncontrollably. She could no longer hold back her rage.</p> 
 <p>“Daisy, feelings can’t be forced,” Shen Zhining dully stated.</p> 
 <p>“But, what do you like about her? Did you find an actress to put on an act to make me give up?” Daisy remained unresigned. She stared fiercely at Sheng Jiaoyang, like a starving beast staring at a piece of juicy meat.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining replied without a change in expression, “I’ve already decided to take her home to meet my grandfather.”</p> 
 <p>Daisy shook her head in denial and started to tear up as she cast a suspicious look at Shen Zhining. “I know that you’ve never liked it when people touch you. However, if she’s really the person you like, you wouldn’t hate it when she touches you, right? Would you dare to let her kiss you in my presence?”</p> 
 <p>“You’re truly soft in the head! Why do I need to kiss him in front of you?” Sheng Jiaoyang immediately jumped in and complained.</p> 
 <p><em>That woman is asking her to kiss Demon King Shen? She would only do that if she were crazy!</em></p> 
 <p>“What? Feeling nervous now because of a guilty conscience?” Daisy immediately rebuked. She wasn’t someone who was easy to deal with. </p> 
 <p>“Are you kidding me? Why would I have a guilty conscience? I just don’t want to make out with my darling in front of outsiders. After all, I’m a shy person. Even if I have to kiss him, I would only do that at home behind closed doors. When that happens, I can kiss him for as long as I want. By then, even making out from morning till night wouldn’t be an issue!” Sheng Jiaoyang stuck her neck out and bluffed.</p> 
 <p>Daisy was nearly angered to death by her words. She stared at Shen Zhining with reddened eyes and no longer quarrelled with Sheng Jiaoyang. Instead, she waited for Shen Zhining to respond.</p> 
 <p>The atmosphere in the room became particularly quiet and heavy.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly felt somewhat uncomfortable in her heart. She reassessed her behaviour from a moment ago, and the more she thought about it, the more she wanted to slap herself. <em>Just look at the mess you’ve gotten yourself into! Demon King Shen sure was evil. He’d actually used her as a shield! Fortunately, they were in China at this moment, or else…she wouldn't know if she could live to see tomorrow's sunrise.</em></p> 
 <p>In comparison with the two women, Shen Zhining was undoubtedly very calm in this situation. He simply asked, “Are you sure you want to see us being intimate?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course!” Daisy firmly responded.</p> 
 <p>Anyone familiar with Shen Zhining would know that he was a germaphobe. He would wear gloves when he had to shake hands with others and detested it when people got close to him. Of course, there were exceptions, like the people he acknowledged.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang still remembered her first encounter with Shen Zhining. At that time, he was five years old and had just lost his parents in an accident, which caused him to develop a bit of autism. She reached out to touch him because she didn’t know what was wrong with him, but as a result, she was pushed to the ground. She still remembered how shocked she was when she fell. How could someone push such a cute and lovely little girl like her away? No one had ever treated her like that before, so this incident remained as an unforgettable scene and was deeply engraved in her mind, even till this date.</p> 
 <p>What was worse was that back then she stuck to Shen Zhining like glue, no matter how many times she’d been pushed away or threatened. Now that she’d recalled all this, she truly didn’t want to admit that she was that Cute Little Angel who’d followed the Little Devil Prince everywhere!</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was still reminiscing when Shen Zhining abruptly grabbed her wrist and pulled her towards him. By the time she’d returned to her senses, she was already sitting on his lap.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was shocked, and with her heart beating like a drum, she blinked in horror. However, what frightened her even more was the slowly approaching face in front of her. Her mind instantly went blank as she gazed into that pair of pitch-black eyes. </p> 
 <p>However, the most petrified person was still Daisy, who was watching from the sidelines. From her current spot, she could see everything clearly. She could only stand there and watch as the man she liked pulled another woman into his arms. Yet, as their faces approached and their lips were about to touch, Daisy broke down and dashed out of the room.</p> 
 <p>The sound of a door opening and closing brought Sheng Jiaoyang back to her senses. Her hands were held down behind her back, so she could only move her head back to create some distance and said, “She’s gone, so you can release me…”</p> 
 <p>Before she could even finish her sentence, she was pushed away.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang awkwardly sat on the ground, reliving the experience of being pushed away like she was some sort of garbage. If there was one saying to describe her current expression, that would be: There was nothing worth remembering in this world.</p> 
 <p>“How long do you want to sit there?” a man’s voice suddenly said behind her. </p> 
 <p>As soon as she heard this voice, Sheng Jiaoyang could no longer suppress her anger. She turned her head and glared at Shen Zhining as she complained, “Just now, I played along with your little act. Will you die if you treated me a bit nicer?!”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining leaned back in his chair and looked at her with a smile that wasn’t quite a smile. “Did I ask you to play along with me?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang thought about it and was rendered speechless.</p> 
 <p>“No, wait…” Sheng Jiaoyang stood up and continued, “…then, why did you call me here?”</p> 
 <p>“How did you know that Daisy was someone from the Stanley Family?” Shen Zhining answered with a question of his own. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang choked upon hearing this.</p> 
 <p>Then, her cell phone suddenly rang, saving her out of this predicament.</p> 
 <p>She instantly relaxed and hurriedly took out her cell phone. The caller ID read ‘Gu Zhou’.</p> 
 <p>After casting a glance at Shen Zhining, she quickly answered, “Hello?”</p> 
 <p>“Did you leave already?”</p> 
 <p>“No, I met an acquaintance and exchanged a few words. Wait a bit…”</p> 
 <p>“Let him leave first,” Shen Zhining suddenly said, interrupting her. </p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou heard a male voice on the other end and asked, “Did you run into some trouble? Do you need help?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine. You go ahead, I’ll go back later by myself.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright then, remember to text me when you get home.”</p> 
 <p>“Will do!” Sheng Jiaoyang responded and hung up.</p> 
 <p>She then turned to Shen Zhining and asked, “Is there anything else?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining picked up a wine glass and unhurriedly took a sip. After a while, he started to deploy his psychological tactics again.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched when she saw him ignore her. She then turned on her heel and proceeded towards the door, but she was blocked by Jing Weinan. As such, she had no choice but to walk back. As a bottle of wine and glasses on the table entered her line of sight, she minded her own business and sat down on the other side, pouring herself a glass. She leisurely drank a few sips while ignoring Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Watching this scene unfold, Shen Zhining slightly narrowed his eyes and asked, “Are you happy with the 6 million?” </p> 
 <p>Cough, cough! Sheng Jiaoyang instantly choked.</p>

 <p>Dear readers,</p>
 <p>I hope all is well on your side. I have prepared a glossary and when I published it, there was a pop-up that said that 0 notifications have been sent out. Therefore, I am posting this announcement just in case some of you hadn't received the notification.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>The glossary is also added to the table of content for future reference. I will try to update this bi-weekly. It could be that I have missed some minor characters in between, if you see any and want me to include them...</p>
