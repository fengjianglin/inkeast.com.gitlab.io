<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Another toast was proposed.</p> 
 <p>After the toast, the contestants clamoured for the chance to get closer to the five male idols.</p> 
 <p>Whatever it was, if they were able to become familiar with the male idols, there might be a possibility that they’d be lent a helping hand. If all else failed, the contestants might still be able to enjoy a bit of exposure from the resultant rumours that may arise.</p> 
 <p>The top three winners of the previous national supermodel competition also joined in the race to be in front.</p> 
 <p>Noticing the situation, the production team hurriedly brought forward the dance event and invited the five idols to choose their partners in the form of a lottery.</p> 
 <p>With five extremely popular male idols present, in that instant, it seemed like Zhuo Yiyan didn’t exist at all.</p> 
 <p>Guiliana laughed at him. “Look at you, you seem out of favour now!”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan just smiled as he didn’t care about Guiliana’s comment. The contestants weren’t anyone dear to him, and it was their freedom to choose who they wanted to go for. He wouldn’t feel left out over something like this.</p> 
 <p>“Hey?” Guiliana cried out in bewilderment. “She’s so unconcerned that she can eat?!”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan followed Guiliana’s line of sight. <em>Isn’t that Xu Jiaojiao eating dessert with gusto at the table over there?</em></p> 
 <p>This little girl…</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan broke into laughter. Truthfully speaking, he was quite curious about what sort of environment Xu Jiaojiao had grown up in as he didn’t know what kind of circumstances would nurture such a peculiar person. Ever since he was young, he’d had a unique opinion of fashion and beauty. Most importantly, she wasn’t at all behaving like a love-struck fool. </p> 
 <p>If Sheng Jiaoyang knew what Zhuo Yiyan was thinking, she would’ve definitely snorted at him. <em>Nonsense! She would scare even herself if she started fangirling. Eh, it seems like she’d revealed something unnecessary about herself…</em></p> 
 <p>“Who’s Xu Jiaojiao?” Xu Yinuo, the first person to draw a name from the lottery asked after opening the slip of paper and looking at the name written inside.</p> 
 <p>“Wow, Jiaojiao was chosen. Jiaojiao!” Wang Wei excitedly cried out.</p> 
 <p>It was only then the other girls realise that there was one person missing.</p> 
 <p>When they looked around and saw Sheng Jiaoyang standing at the food table struggling to swallow a cookie shoved into her mouth while holding a fork on the fruit plate, they didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p> 
 <p><em>She’s filled with confidence!</em></p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, hurry up and come here! You’re so lucky to be selected by Prince Charming Xu! Soon, you two will need to inaugurate the party with the first dance!” </p> 
 <p>Listening to Wang Wei speaking as if she’d won a prize, Sheng Jiaoyang silently swallowed the rest of the cookie in her mouth.</p> 
 <p><em>Thank you! But, can I refuse?</em></p> 
 <p>Of course, she could only refuse in her heart. She was now only a poor girl who had no power. In other people’s opinion, it was a blessing to have a big star pick you as a partner. If she dared to refuse, then that would mean she was unable to differentiate good from bad.</p> 
 <p>Under everyone’s envious and jealous gazes, Sheng Jiaoyang walked slowly to Xu Yinuo’s side.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Nuo, the two of you can form a father and daughter combination! Haha!” Ye Fan teased.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo smiled gently, and said, “Had I married early, my child would be around her age now.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, it's Qi An’s turn to draw.”</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhhhh! Idol, you have to pick me!!!” The girls who were unable to hold back anymore began to squeal.</p> 
 <p><em>Why did it seem like they were fighting over who would obtain the emperor’s token?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang pursed her lips.</p> 
 <p>Qi An paused as he went to pick a name, and with a gaze as light as a feather, he glanced in disapproval at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked her eyes innocently. <em>She wasn’t the person who’d accidentally taken the words out of his mouth!</em></p> 
 <p>“Qi Hua,” Qi An opened the paper and read out a name.</p> 
 <p>“Is it me? Is it really me?” Qi Hua was particularly excited as she’d finally found an opportunity to stand out.</p> 
 <p>“It seems like I read it wrong,” Qi An said with a deadpan look.</p> 
 <p>In that instant, Qi Hua’s complexion changed greatly. She’d clearly heard Qi An read out her name.</p> 
 <p>“I’m just teasing you.” Qi An’s lips raised in a smile.</p> 
 <p>The contestants were taken aback; their idol seemed to be different from the cold and aloof image that they’d imagined…</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang giggled. Qi An’s personality quite suited her taste.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Sheng Jiaoyang was laughing, Qi Hua’s complexion darkened.</p> 
 <p><em>What are you laughing at? What’s so funny? Didn’t you get chosen by an old man? What are you so proud of?!</em></p> 
 <p>Qi Hua walked quickly to Qi An’s side. Sniffing the faint scent of perfume emanating from the person beside her, she finally felt content. <em>What’s so good about an old man? She was the lucky one! Qi An had chosen her, and he had the best background amongst all of the idols!</em></p> 
 <p>Following that, Zhou Zhiyu, Jiang Liqing, and Ye Fan each selected a dance partner.</p> 
 <p>The music started.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo slightly bent towards Sheng Jiaoyang, and like a gentleman, he reached out his hand.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at him and took his hand before following him into the circle.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know how to dance, little girl?” Xi Yinuo asked as he smiled.</p> 
 <p>A corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips twitched. <em>Little girl?</em></p> 
 <p>“Since you called me little girl, do you want me to call you uncle?” Sheng Jiaoyang tilted her head and replied with a question of her own.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo stared blankly at her for a moment before laughing. Although he was fifty years old, with streaks of grey hair, his laugh still could topple all living beings. When he was younger, he was known as a handsome man who could attract thousands of women. Now, while the years may have eroded his young face, it had also given him a gentle personality.</p> 
 <p>He always laughed, but at that moment, everyone could see that he was truly happy.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I’ll call you Jiaojiao. You don’t mind, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Suit yourself.”</p> 
 <p>Compared to the other partners, this combination with the biggest age gap was indeed very harmonious. Discerning people could see that the couple were comfortable with their conversation. At least, the smile on Xu Yinuo’s face never went away, and sometimes, he laughed heartily.</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua, who’d spoken for the sixth time and only received replies such as ‘hmm’ and ‘oh’, was inwardly irritable and ready to crumble. After dancing, Qi An resumed his cold face and ignored her enthusiastic attempts at conversation.</p> 
 <p>Compared to them, Xu Yinuo and Xu Jiaojiao were like friends despite the difference in age. It could be heard from their occasional conversation that Xu Yinuo was the one taking the initiative to talk.</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua almost ground her teeth in frustration.</p> 
 <p>The ‘father and daughter combination’ were completely relaxed as they conversed.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I presume you’ve never heard my song, right?”</p> 
 <p>“My mother really likes your song.”</p> 
 <p>“Can you sing my song then?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m tone deaf.” Sheng Jiaoyang laughed before continuing, “But, my father sang your song, ‘White Haired Promise’ well. He sang that song to chase after my mother.”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect that one of my songs could contribute to such a good story. It seems like your mother really likes my song. Next time I have a concert, I’ll definitely invite you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was silent for two seconds before answering, “Sure.”</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo’s brows rose. He felt that the mood of the girl before his eyes had suddenly dropped, but why?</p> 
 <p>When the song ended, the god-like idols once again drew a dance partner from the rest of the list.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang silently went to the side and looked up at the stars in the sky.</p> 
 <p>Amongst the group of party people, there was a lonely person.</p> 
 <p>“Homesick?” asked a voice from behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang recovered her expression, and she turned to see Zhuo Yiyan approaching.</p> 
 <p>“I’m drunk. Can I return to my room and rest first?”</p> 
 <p>“Sure.”</p> 
 <p>Upon receiving a reply, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t say anything further and returned to the villa.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan looked up at the sky. The night sky was dotted with just a few stars, and it appeared to be very lonely.</p>
