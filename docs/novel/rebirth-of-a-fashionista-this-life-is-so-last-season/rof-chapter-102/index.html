<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Knock knock…</p> 
 <p>The sound of knocking repeatedly echoed in Sheng Jiaoyang’s ears, waking her up from her deep slumber. Before she’d even opened her eyes, she felt shocks of pain in her head as if someone was constantly beating a drum next to her ears.</p> 
 <p>She got up with a heavy head and almost lost her footing. She quickly held onto the wall and slowly moved to open the door.</p> 
 <p>"Don’t you know who’s here? How come we knocked for so long and yet you only open the door now…?" Ning Xiaoruan didn’t even finish talking when Sheng Jiaoyang collapsed. He subconsciously reached out to catch her, but then he remembered that her boyfriend was standing next to him, so he quickly handed her over to the other person.</p> 
 <p>"Cousin, take care of your girlfriend yourself."</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining glanced indifferently at Ning Xiaoruan and looked down at the person who’d fallen into his arms. The face that used to be either smiling or whimsical was now deathly pale, carrying with it a tint of red. He didn’t even need to take a second look at her to know that she was running a high fever.</p> 
 <p>"Go find her long coat," he commanded.</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan quickly entered the room, grabbed a windbreaker from the closet, and ran back outside to hand it over to his cousin.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining wrapped the clothes around Sheng Jiaoyang, picked her up, and quickly walked towards the elevator.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang awoke, she was already in a ward, hooked up to an IV.</p> 
 <p>Only Zeng Huan was sitting in the room, playing on her phone with her head lowered.</p> 
 <p>“Pour me a glass of water.” Sheng Jiaoyang leaned against the bedhead and slowly sat up.</p> 
 <p>When Zeng Huan heard her speak, she quickly put down her phone to go pour water whilst saying, “Jiaojiao, you really scared me this time. It’s all my fault, I should’ve bought you some cold medicine after you finished filming that scene in the rain yesterday. No, I should’ve prepared them beforehand…”</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay, this has nothing to do with you,” Sheng Jiaoyang said as she took the cup of water.</p> 
 <p>When she’d finished drinking, she asked, “What time is it now?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s almost five in the afternoon,” Zeng Huan looked at her watch and replied.</p> 
 <p>“It’s Ning Xiaoruan who brought me here, right? Where is he?”</p> 
 <p>“Assistant Ning is also here, but his cousin was the one who brought you here.” Zeng Huan cast a prudent glance at Sheng Jiaoyang as she continued, “I accidentally overheard Assistant Ning saying that you’re his cousin’s girlfriend. Does President Li know about this?”</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm.” Sheng Jiaoyang nodded absent-mindedly while wondering: <em>When did Shen Zhining come to find her, and why? Could it be that his family has arranged another blind date for him?</em></p> 
 <p>While she was deep in thought, the person in question actually arrived.</p> 
 <p>“How are you feeling now? “Shen Zhining walked over to the bedside and looked down at her.</p> 
 <p>“I’m feeling alright. I’m well enough to get discharged now.” Sheng Jiaoyang bit her lip and added, “Uhmm, thanks for bringing me to the hospital.”</p> 
 <p>When Ning Xiaoruan walked into the ward with food in his hand, he heard Sheng Jiaoyang’s words and immediately asked in bewilderment, “Did you guys really break up?”</p> 
 <p>The reason he thought this was because the two people in front of him normally loved to show their affection in front of others. But, they’d suddenly started treating each other like outsiders, which was very unusual.</p> 
 <p>“No, we haven’t. Which one of your eyes saw us break up?”</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t break up? Then, why do I feel like you guys aren’t that intimate anymore.” Ning Xiaoruan’s suspicious look hovered between the two.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked her eyes towards Shen Zhining and said, “Darling, hurry up and tell him whether or not we broke up.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing her like that, there was no need for Shen Zhining to say anything, and Ning Xiaoruan knew that they hadn’t broken up. But, he still looked at them with a suspicious look in his eyes. In general, he still felt that their way of getting along wasn’t the same as before, but he wasn’t sure if that was the case or it was just his imagination.</p> 
 <p>“I’m hungryyy!” Sheng Jiaoyang exclaimed as she stared at the bags in Ning Xiaoruan’s hands.</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan quickly stuffed the bags he was holding in his cousin’s hands and shrugged his shoulders. He then said, “Your girlfriend is the one who’s hungry, what are you looking at me for?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining naturally knew to act his part, so he put the bags down on the bedside cupboard and unhurriedly took out the food, placing them on the counter one by one. There was porridge and some fruit.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Shen Zhining roll up his cuffs to start unpacking the food container to feed her porridge, Sheng Jiaoyang started to feel a bit awkward. So, she said, “Just put it on the table. I’ll do it myself.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining sat on the bed and looked at her for a second before gently scooping up a spoonful of porridge and bringing it to her mouth.</p> 
 <p>Staring into his dark, profound eyes, Sheng Jiaoyang could only force herself to drink that scoop of porridge without tasting it. Truthfully, when Shen Zhining put on a serious act, he was, in fact, much scarier than her!</p> 
 <p>Just like that, one drank as the other fed more spoonfuls of porridge until the food container was empty.</p> 
 <p>This was probably the first time that Shen Zhining had fed someone, and it could be regarded as a novel experience for him. Especially when he saw the other open her mouth to swallow the porridge, spoonful by spoonful. Slowly, the feeling of owning a pet emerged in his heart.</p> 
 <p>“Are you full?” His gaze swept across the tip of her tongue that was licking her lips.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I’m full now,” Sheng Jiaoyang quickly responded.</p> 
 <p>“Mhmm…” Shen Zhining threw the empty food container in the trash and got up to go to the bathroom to wash his hands.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang quietly stared at his back. Just now, his tone had sounded a tad disappointed. Was that just an illusion? If so, then this misconception was really frightening.</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan, who’d witnessed the whole scene, felt that he’d seen enough of their PDA. He’d initially wanted to see the day his cousin accomplished this task, but when he really saw how considerate his cousin was when feeding his girlfriend, he felt abused again. He looked at Sheng Jiaoyang with a complicated expression and thought: <em>Xu Jiaojiao is really something! She could even make my inhumane cousin do something like this for her…</em></p> 
 <p>“Have you told my mother about me getting sick?” Sheng Jiaoyang turned and looked at Ning Xiaoruan.</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t your mother follow the inspection team to the mountain area? Why would I disturb her? You have my cousin anyway, so isn’t it the same going to him?”</p> 
 <p><em>But, your cousin isn’t my guardian.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched at this thought.</p> 
 <p>Knock, knock. Someone knocked on the door, and then a person wearing a cap walked in soon after.</p> 
 <p>“You are…?” Zeng Huan was about to block this person, but then she saw the person lift his face. “G-gu Zhou?!!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned upon hearing this and said, “Your connections sure are broad. You actually got wind of me being hospitalised so quickly!”</p> 
 <p>“A lot of people ran off to my Weibo and tagged me, saying that you were in the hospital. Given that, it’d be impossible for me not to know what’s going on. I wouldn’t even be able to pretend…” Gu Zhou’s mouth curled upwards as he smilingly said.</p> 
 <p>He handed a bouquet of flowers and a fruit basket to Zeng Huan before walking over to Sheng Jiaoyang’s side. “How are you feeling?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s just a common cold and fever, I feel better already.” Sheng Jiaoyang sized up Gu Zhou and added, “Why did you run all the way here in your spare time? Aren’t you afraid of being caught by the paparazzi?”</p> 
 <p>“No matter how busy I am, I still have to rest once in a while. Besides, my friend has fallen ill, so I ought to make some time to visit. As for the paparazzi…even if they do catch me, there’s nothing I can do about it. An upright man like me isn’t afraid of gossip anyway, and I don’t have a wife or a girlfriend. As for the rest…it’s just superficial gossip, so it doesn’t really matter.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hadn’t said anything yet when Ning Xiaoruan jumped out and said, “Our Jiaojiao already has a boyfriend!”</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou swept a glance at Ning Xiaoruan, feeling that he looked somewhat familiar. At the same time, Shen Zhining came out of the bathroom and the two men stared at each other.</p> 
 <p>“Huan, help me call the nurse over to remove the IV. The drip is finished,” Sheng Jiaoyang’s voice broke the silence in the room.</p> 
 <p>“Ohhh, alright!” Zeng Huan hurriedly ran out.</p> 
 <p>Gu Zhou shifted his gaze to look at Sheng Jiaoyang. “I’m relieved to see that you’re okay. Then, I’ll get going first.”</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for visiting me today.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled at Gu Zhou.</p> 
 <p>“Remember to rest more and drink plenty of water,” Gu Zhou urged her before putting on his cap and leaving.</p> 
 <p>The nurse entered the ward right after Gu Zhou had left.</p> 
 <p>After the IV was removed, Sheng Jiaoyang went to the bathroom.</p> 
 <p>Ning Xiaoruan walked towards Shen Zhining and stopped in front of him, whispering, “Cousin, I finally understand why you asked me to stay with Xu Jiaojiao. You can rest assured, I’ll surely take care of my future cousin-in-law. I won’t let any men get close to her!”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>Da fudge is he saying? Did he take the wrong medicine?!</em></p>
