 <p>Right before boarding the plane to return to China, Lin Yan suddenly received a call.</p> 
 <p>Throughout the entire call, Sheng Jiaoyang saw his expression turn darker and darker. He also didn’t speak much during the call. In fact, he had only spoken once at the start of the call, and once more at the end.</p> 
 <p>“Lin Yan, if you have any urgent matters that you need to attend to, you should go and attend to them first,” Sheng Jiaoyang said.</p> 
 <p>“Then, we’ll return to China tomorrow instead.” Lin Yan finally calmed down after being agitated by the phone call.</p> 
 <p>A bright light sparkled in Sheng Jiaoyang’s eyes, and she firmly refused, “I will return by myself. I don’t want to wait another day to see Grandfather.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan looked at her and he was torn between choosing to fight for power, or choosing to be with his lover.</p> 
 <p>He knew that Sheng Jiaoyang had given him a choice, and he could only choose between one or the other.</p> 
 <p>When she saw that he was hesitating, Sheng Jiaoyang could not help but feel a twinge of disappointment. However, she kept her feelings hidden in her heart, and after making sure that her disappointment was not showing on her face, she said to Lin Yan, “Lin Yan, go ahead and tend to your matters. You can come and look for me when you’re done, I’ll just be with Grandfather anyway.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan looked deeply at Sheng Jiaoyang. Then, he held her gently and said, “Wait for me.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright.” At this moment, the final boarding call was announced over the intercoms, and Sheng Jiaoyang took a step back and said, “I’ll be going now.”</p> 
 <p>Lin Yan watched Sheng Jiaoyang slowly fade away into the distance, as he clenched his hands into tight fists. He wanted to go after her so badly, but he could not forsake everything that he had achieved up until now. If he gave up now, it would mean that all his past efforts would go down the drain. Besides, he would only have to wait a day before he could see her again.</p> 
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang boarded the plane, she took the seat by the window and turned around to look at the empty seat beside her. This seat was supposed to be occupied by Lin Yan.</p> 
 <p>The memories of the previous time she returned to China resurfaced in her mind. That time, she also returned to China on her own. </p> 
 <p>She sighed and closed her eyes as she got ready to sleep.</p> 
 <p>Last night, she had too much on her mind, and she did not get much rest. Hence, she quickly drifted to sleep after closing her eyes.</p> 
 <p>However, shortly after she fell asleep, she sensed that someone sat down beside her, and she was jolted awake.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang turned around and saw a familiar face.</p> 
 <p>“You…”</p> 
 <p>The person who sat down beside her was Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked calm, and he said in an ambiguous tone, “Can’t I sit here?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was not sure how to reply to his question, and his attitude puzzled her. He acted so indifferently, but he still wanted to sit beside her. Just what was he trying to do?</p> 
 <p>“Suit yourself.” She closed her eyes and left him alone.</p> 
 <p>“Why isn’t your beloved with you?” Shen Zhining asked in his usual sarcastic tone.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes, “He has to handle something.”</p> 
 <p>“What is it?”</p> 
 <p>“Why must I tell you?” Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at him. Truthfully, she did not even know what Lin Yan was currently dealing with.</p> 
 <p>“I can tell you if you don’t know about it.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her brows, “You know about it?”</p> 
 <p>A sneer appeared on Shen Zhining’s face, “I heard that the family business that he took over recently got into trouble, and the matter has been raised to the head of their family. If he doesn’t give a clear explanation himself… hah, he will lose his position.”</p> 
 <p>“Why are you so clearly informed? Could it be…”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her, and the emotions in his eyes were something that Sheng Jiaoyang could not understand or decipher. “It is exactly what you think it is.”</p> 
 <p>As Lin Yan’s girlfriend, she should severely condemn Shen Zhining’s actions, but now, she was not even certain if she was Lin Yan’s girlfriend, and her relationship with Shen Zhining was also very ambiguous and unclear.</p> 
 <p>Most importantly…</p> 
 <p>Deep in her heart, she did not feel that what Shen Zhining did was wrong. She was even slightly curious about what he had done.</p> 
 <p>Everything and everyone around her was different from what she remembered. The people she thought she liked, like Lin Yan, suddenly became someone she did not like, and the people she initially disliked and feared, like Shen Zhining, suddenly was not as fearful as she originally thought.</p> 
 <p>That’s right. She has now realized that whenever she came face to face with Shen Zhining, she no longer feared him as much as she did in the past. It was as if her subconscious was telling her that this person would not hurt her anymore.</p> 
 <p>This feeling was very fascinating, and she couldn’t help but want to find out what happened between them.</p> 
 <p>“Uh, I…” Sheng Jiaoyang was about to ask him something, but she saw him close his eyes, and the expression on his face was practically screaming: <em>I’m not going to listen to anything you say. The corners of her mouth twitched, and she leaned back into her seat without saying anything else.</em></p> 
 <p>She thought she would not fall asleep with Shen Zhining seated beside her, but she quickly fell into a deep sleep, and she did not even have an ounce of vigilance against him. She stirred awake in the middle of the flight as she heard the flight attendant walk past their seats. The man beside her seemed to have ordered a glass of alcohol, and she could vaguely feel him staring at her, but soon, she returned to sleep.</p> 
 <p>“…You may alight now,” the flight attendant said sweetly.</p> 
 <p>“Let her sleep a while more. If your next flight is delayed because of this, I will pay for the damages.” Shen Zhining intentionally spoke softly, and his voice carried a touching tenderness.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to continue sleeping, but she slowly stirred awake when she heard the conversation. After all, she had enough sleep.</p> 
 <p>When she opened her eyes, the flight attendant was still standing there. Rather, she stood by the aisle awkwardly as she was put in a dilemma. But when she saw that Sheng Jiaoyang was finally awake, she happily said, “Ms. Xu, you’re awake. We have arrived at the destination, you may proceed to alight from the plane.”</p> 
 <p>“Okay.” Sheng Jiaoyang was ready to stand up, but she was snapped back into her seat by the seat belt that she had forgotten to unbuckle.</p> 
 <p>A pair of hands reached over, and unbuckled the seat belt on her waist.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked up and saw an expressionless Shen Zhining. He then calmly kept his hands to himself, as if he had done something insignificant.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you.”</p> 
 <p>The flight attendant stood aside excitedly as she waited for them to leave their seats. Then, she rushed up and said in a quiet voice, “Ms. Xu, I like you a lot. Can I take a picture with you?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was stunned. <em>What’s going on?</em></p> 
 <p>The excited expression on the flight attendant’s face could not be faked. She looked so excited that she seemed like she was meeting her favourite celebrity.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, alright.”</p> 
 <p>The flight attendant took out her phone and stood beside Sheng Jiaoyang. Then, she took a few selfies.</p> 
 <p>After taking the selfies, she smiled happily and wished Sheng Jiaoyang and Shen Zhining the best, “May your relationship be more loving than ever! Your fans are waiting for your good news.”</p> 
 <p>“…” <em>What?</em> </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked towards Shen Zhining, and he looked back at her. When he saw that unfamiliar look on her face, his heart sank, and he walked away.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang walked behind Shen Zhining with a confused look. As she was preoccupied with her own thoughts, she did not notice that Shen Zhining had suddenly stopped walking, and she knocked into him.</p> 
 <p>“What were you thinking about? You did not even pay attention to where you are walking.”</p> 
 <p>“What does it matter to you?” Sheng Jiaoyang rubbed her forehead as she rebutted him.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked at her coldly and walked away without another word.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stared at Shen Zhining’s back as he walked away, and she felt somewhat stunned.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, can I take a picture with you?” a meek voice called out cautiously beside her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked over to find a young schoolgirl. She frowned and asked her, “Why do you want to take a photo with me?”</p> 
 <p>“…” the schoolgirl was shocked.</p>
