<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang almost fell to the ground when she retreated, but fortunately, there was a wall supporting her.</p> 
 <p>"W-what on earth do you want to confirm?"</p> 
 <p>She grabbed her hair in a frenzy.</p> 
 <p>"Don't you know it already?"</p> 
 <p>"What do I know? All I know is that you’ve gone mad!" Sheng Jiaoyang glared at him.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining smiled. "If that’s the case, then it’s all because of you."</p> 
 <p><em>OMG! Lord, please quickly return the former Demon King Shen!</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shuddered and said, "Didn’t you find me suspicious before? You'd better continue doubting me!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining approached her, and she retreated in fear. He wasn’t in a hurry, and like a lazy lion playing with his prey, he slowly closed in on her.</p> 
 <p>"Ouch!" Sheng Jiaoyang exclaimed in pain. She raised her hand and touched the back of her head with her eyes closed. She was secretly annoyed at herself for not having the courage to resist Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>"You’re suspicious, but I’ve discovered something more interesting."</p> 
 <p>"What…?" Sheng Jiaoyang followed his gaze and quickly raised her hand to cover her mouth before indistinctly saying, "Don't mess around! You’re really trying my patience now!"</p> 
 <p>"Haha…" Shen Zhining couldn’t help himself and burst into laughter, his voice deep and magnetic. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s ears felt like they’d been caressed. <em>It turned out that Shen Zhining's laughter was so pleasant to the ear.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Sure enough, Shen Zhining came with a honey trap. That must be it!</em></p> 
 <p>"If you don't resist me kissing you, can I take it as you liking me as well?" Shen Zhining looked at her and asked.</p> 
 <p>"How could I possibly like you?!" Sheng Jiaoyang replied without thinking.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining's expression instantly darkened.</p> 
 <p><em>The speed at which he turned hostile was incomparable!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang felt that things didn’t look good and secretly complained in her heart.</p> 
 <p>"Impossible? How about we try it again?" Shen Zhining’s face closed in on hers.</p> 
 <p>"No!" One of Sheng Jiaoyang’s hand was pressed against Shen Zhining’s shoulder and she continued covering her mouth with the other.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, you…" a voice called out from behind them.</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang saw An Jing, her eyes immediately lit up as if she saw a life-saving straw.</p> 
 <p>As Shen Zhining took in her expression, a trace of darkness flashed across his eyes. He then gloomily stared at the approaching An Jing.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing the two’s polar opposite expressions, An Jing indifferently explained, "Since you didn’t return after such a long time, Grandfather asked me to come and have a look."</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather’s looking for me? I’ll go over now! "</p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang removed her hand, An Jing noticed her ruddy lips and a glint flashed across his eyes. Afterwards, he swept a glance at Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was itching to leave, but she was held back by Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>"What? Didn’t you hear An Jing say that my grandfather is looking for me? Do you want to get beaten again?" Sheng Jiaoyang glanced over.</p> 
 <p>"Your cell phone." Shen Zhining unfolded his hand.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly grabbed the phone, and at this time, Shen Zhining extended his other hand and smoothed her messy hair. She looked up at him in a daze. His sudden tenderness left her at a complete loss. </p> 
 <p>"Hurry and go back. Otherwise, Grandfather Yang will think that I've bullied you again."</p> 
 <p><em>Isn’t that the case? Shen Zhining had really opened her eyes this time. How could there be such a capricious, shameless, treacherous, cunning, callous, unreasonable, perverted, and annoying man in the world?!</em></p> 
 <p>When Sheng Jiaoyang returned to the banquet hall, the first person to greet her was Lin Yu.</p> 
 <p>"You…" Lin Yu noticed her flushed cheeks and slightly swollen lips.</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, he saw two other people come in.</p> 
 <p>Having noticed Lin Yu's gaze and hesitation, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly realised something. Her cheeks instantly flushed and the tips of her ears turned bright red.</p> 
 <p>"Looks like you have found someone you like," Lin Yu smilingly said, with a look that read ‘congrats!’.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was about to refute when she spotted Shen Zhining walking over from the corner of her eye. She bared her teeth and swiftly changed the topic. "Let’s continue where we left off earlier. Did you come up with the content of the program already?"</p> 
 <p>"I know that you’re good at drawing, but can you make sand paintings?" As expected, when they started talking business, Lin Yu instantly straightened his expression.</p> 
 <p>"No." Sheng Jiaoyang pondered for a moment and added, "I can't think of anything else. How about I play a piano song instead?!"</p> 
 <p>"You can play the piano?" Lin Yu looked at her in surprise.</p> 
 <p>"A little bit. If I can play a song in its entirety, I can do it. But, if you ask me to play with heartfelt emotions, I won’t be able to do it." <em>She played the piano simply by memorising the technique, scores, and rhythms. If she didn’t possess an excellent memory and quick reflexes, how could she possibly have learned to play the piano?</em></p> 
 <p>"That’s great, can you play a song for me next time at school?"</p> 
 <p>"Of course!"</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu looked at the taciturn man standing next to him and took the initiative to greet him, "Hello!"</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded in acknowledgement.</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu didn’t feel offended by Shen Zhining’s cold response. Instead, he knowingly excused himself. "There's nothing else to discuss, so I'll excuse myself first."</p> 
 <p>"Go ahead,” Shen Zhining finally replied. </p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth twitched. The last thing she wanted at this moment was to stay with Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Grandfather Yang, who’d been watching from the sidelines, waited until An Jing was back before asking, "Did Zhining do anything to Jiaojiao?"</p> 
 <p>An Jing's gaze flickered as he replied, "No, he didn’t."</p> 
 <p>"That’s good, then." As Grandfather Yang stared at Shen Zhining, who was standing beside Jiaojiao, he still felt a bit worried. "I'd better go and have a look."</p> 
 <p>Lin Yu had just left when he arrived.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather!" Seeing Grandfather Yang, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately felt more confident.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang looked at Shen Zhining and solemnly asked, "Zhining, have you forgotten what I told you?"</p> 
 <p>"I haven't forgotten, but I can't comply because…" Shen Zhining's eyes fell on Sheng Jiaoyang before he added, "I realised that I like her."</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang coughed and was taken aback by this sudden confession.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang wanted to grab her hair in a frenzy again. <em>He actually dared to say that he liked her in front of Grandfather!</em></p> 
 <p>"You liking Jiaojiao is your own business," Grandfather Yang said.</p> 
 <p>"How can it be my own business? She was the one who messed with me first. She must take responsibility." Shen Zhining replied, one word at a time.</p> 
 <p>"I messed with you first?" Sheng Jiaoyang was at a loss. "How did I mess with you?"</p> 
 <p>The corners of Shen Zhining’s mouth arched upwards slightly, and he unhurriedly smirked, "Since you’ve forgotten, I’ll remind you. First of all, you took my first kiss."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt as if she was struck by lightning. <em>First kiss…how dare he mention that?!</em></p> 
 <p>"Secondly, you asked me out to watch a movie."</p> 
 <p><em>OMG! She was regretting this so much now!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang took a deep breath. <em>How she wished that she could turn back time…</em></p> 
 <p>"Moreover, you prepared breakfast and dinner every day, and in the evening, you massaged my acupoints to help calm my nerves. Would you do all this for another person?"</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was rendered speechless. <em>That’s impossible, how could she casually take someone else’s first kiss? She wasn’t such a casual person. Wait!</em></p> 
 <p>"When did I take your first kiss?!"</p> 
 <p>"You don’t remember?" Shen Zhining glanced at her.</p> 
 <p>Upon seeing his expression, Sheng Jiaoyang felt goosebumps rise on her arms.</p> 
 <p>"You jumped on me and kissed me that time." Shen Zhining’s lips curled into a smile.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised her hand to cover her face. <em>Alright, there really was such a thing. Cough, how could Demon King Shen be so shameless? How could he openly say that he’d been forcibly kissed by others?</em></p> 
 <p>"And, that other time, you broke into the bathroom…"</p> 
 <p>"Stop!" Sheng Jiaoyang hurriedly interrupted him.</p> 
 <p><em>Fine, you win.</em> Sheng Jiaoyang glared at Shen Zhining and dejectedly muttered, "Alright, I admit that I’ve done all that."</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang opened his mouth, but no words came out.</p> 
 <p>An Jing, who was standing behind Grandfather Yang, had his head lowered as if he’d entered a meditative state. If one didn’t look carefully at the corners of his mouth, which were quivering slightly, they’d think that he was very calm and unperturbed.</p> 
 <p>Fortunately, there was no one else there to join in the fun beside them. Otherwise, these words would’ve certainly caused a huge uproar.</p> 
 <p>"Didn't you say that Jiaojiao had ulterior motives and suspected that I was hypnotised by her? Now, how come…?" Grandfather Yang didn’t know what word to use to describe Shen Zhining's change.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining replied in a calm and unruffled manner, "Grandfather Yang, I was wrong for thinking that way before. As you’ve said, I should trust your intuition. After all, you’ve experienced and seen more of the world than I have."</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang choked on this remark.</p> 
 <p><em>Grandfather, hang in there!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang cast a hopeful look at Grandfather Yang.</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang coughed. He then cleared his throat, "I won’t interfere with your relationship as long as you treat Jiaojiao well."</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather Yang, you can rest assured. I didn't do anything to her even when I doubted her, and I’d naturally treat her well in the future."</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang secretly rolled her eyes.</p> 
 <p>"Jiaojiao, come with me. I'd like to have a word with you alone," Grandfather Yang said and walked away with Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather!" Sheng Jiaoyang helplessly called out before nervously adding, "What should I do?"</p> 
 <p>"There’s nothing we can do about this. You reap what you sow."</p> 
 <p>"I don't think he gave up, he must still have his doubts. He just changed his way of approach."</p> 
 <p>"A different approach? What kind of approach?" Grandfather Yang curiously asked.</p> 
 <p>"A honey trap!"</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Grandfather Yang couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Jiaojiao, have you watched too many dramas lately? This is reality. Moreover, based on Zhining's personality, do you think that he’d sacrifice himself for the sake of finding out the so-called truth?"</p> 
 <p><em>That made sense!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang nodded. "Could it be that he really likes me?"</p> 
 <p>"You can do as you see fit, but I still stand by my opinion. You two aren’t suitable for each other," Grandfather Yang said.</p> 
 <p>"I think so too, but how can I break away from him?" Sheng Jiaoyang supported her forehead, looking distressed.</p> 
 <p>"You’re a clever girl, so this kind of thing won’t pose a problem for you." Grandfather Yang helplessly encouraged before gliding away in his wheelchair.</p> 
 <p>"Sigh…" Sheng Jiaoyang stared at the sky, deep in thought. <em>Why did she feel that her current predicament was much more difficult than when she was trying to drum up good feelings?</em></p> 
 <p>She raised her hand and was about to hit herself on her head when her gaze landed on her cell phone. A thought then suddenly popped into her mind.</p> 
 <p><em>Got it!</em></p> 
 <p><em>She must get the lead role in that film. In that case, she’d follow the crew to the mountains for two months and avoid him. During this period when they couldn't see each other, maybe Shen Zhining would figure it out on his own.</em></p> 
 <p>"What are you thinking about?"</p> 
 <p>"I…" Seeing that Shen Zhining was approaching, Sheng Jiaoyang instantly shut up.</p>
