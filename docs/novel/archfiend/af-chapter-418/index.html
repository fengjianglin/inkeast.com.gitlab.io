 <p>Hey guys, I'm excited to let you know that <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/physicians-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physician's Odyssey</a> is now out of sneak peek and available for everyone to read, with 60 chapters to start! &nbsp;This is a modern wuxia novel that is part of our big 2019 kickoff to more genres.&nbsp; Authored by Smoking Pipe Bro and translated by Wuxiaworld veteran Thyaeria (who is also working with us on The Great Ruler and Tales of Demons &amp; Gods), this Zongheng novel brings us the story of the brilliant physician Su Tao.&nbsp; Su Tao is a medical genius, but just wants to maintain...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rocjourney said in a soft voice, “He’s already gone mad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Imprisoned for centuries, he went from Great Circle Foundation Establishment with hope for Core Formation to an eternal puppet now. His ego is too sensitive. Any ordinary words will be treated by him as a provocation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Provocation?” Floatingcloud looked at Rocjourney in an exaggerated manner and waved his hand. “Nonono… nothing is wrong… nothing is wrong. I merely stand on an even higher plane and look at all of you as nothing more than slag.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile emerged on Xu Yangyi’s face. Followingly, a streak of azure light fired out like a waterfall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the light didn’t hit Floatingcloud. A hand softly grabbed onto the light, and then the powerful spiritual pressure of middle-stage Foundation Establishment filled the plaza with a rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moonless’s gaze stirred, and he adopted a proper stance. Xu Yangyi and Rocjourney both grew solemn and looked at the man facing them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had actually received Xu Yangyi’s attack in Floatingcloud’s stead! As willfully as the azure light was launched, his hand likewise twisted the attack into motes of spiritual light with the same willfulness, sending them drifting through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who dares attack him?” Bladevessel stepped forward, and his spiritual pressure completely exploded. Unexpectedly, a strange wall of black wind was formed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">these&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">are your true colors?” Xu Yangyi’s hair and clothes rippled loudly in the wind, due to Bladevessel’s uninhibited qi. The full release of qi only illustrated one matter. If Xu Yangyi came over, then they would both fight to their last breath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A battle to the death between Foundation Establishment cultivators!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those words about the passage back then were to deceive me. You went through a lot of trouble, too. Looks like all you said about gods and immortals is fake, right? Maybe that staff isn’t from something Great Sage Sun was suppressing? And you, back then you were afraid of Enihilus and the Dream Walker’s struggle because a sudden crack on the seal would bring the climax? You just didn’t want me coming in and disrupting the balance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me guess, you’re another incarnation laid out by the Dream Walker? Or a native of the Clearcloud Realm that just happened to become aware of this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel smiled. “You cannot be considered stupid. As for who I am, why would I tell you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of deep disappointment flickered through Xu Yangyi’s heart. To this day, he had two opportunities to ask whether immortals were real. Xiaoqing hadn’t told him, and he’d originally believed himself to have seen the truth. Furthermore, it made sense based on reason. But unexpectedly, it was all a pack of lies in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For the sake of past karma, I will warn you of a word.” Bladevessel bore his hands behind him and drawled, “The Fellow Daoist Floatingcloud of now isn’t someone lowly dregs like all of you can hope to strive for. You simply do not understand this point of terror.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In an instant, mountains and rivers are formed, and the permanent and impermanent are freely traveled. Although it is late Foundation Establishment, it can be called the strongest figure under Core Formation. It is unparalleled. So…” He eyed Xu Yangyi as if he was looking at a dead man. “Don’t play to folly. At least you can still survive. Your strength is not bad. To die here is too much of a pity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi said indifferently, “So I should kneel and live?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel answered in an unperturbed voice, “It is much better than standing in death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi smirked and stowed his gaze, but his eyes and Rocjourney’s motionlessly intersected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Rocjourney, Bladevessel, Floatingcloud, he, Moonless, and the puppet were present. A total of six people. Excluding him, Rocjourney, Moonless, and Floatingcloud, the other half of the seal could only be Bladevessel or the puppet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel’s actions now could almost immediately confirm for them who the other half of the seal was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Floatingcloud looked at Bladevessel with seemingly deep meaning. “One who is solicitous without account hides evil intention… Fellow Daoist, you are quite unfamiliar. Let me guess, who are you Fellow Daoist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who I am isn’t important,” Bladevessel said indifferently. “I stand on your side. Isn’t this reason enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Floatingcloud cackled darkly and then curbed his smile. He sneered and said, “It is not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel’s gaze suddenly needled. He wasn’t alone, however. The gazes of everyone present faintly skipped… because in the next second, without any spiritual force, a massive palm that was thirty meters in size appeared out of thin air! With the momentum of a thunderbolt evading ear cover, it slammed towards Bladevessel!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t need trash!” Floatingcloud’s raging laughter quaked the heavens. “If you want to serve me then prove you have the qualifications!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Divine ability?!” Rocjourney took a step forward in shock. “Impossible! His qi sea is ruined! He doesn’t have a single trace of spiritual force! How could he use a divine ability!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel’s gaze shrunk. With crisis approaching, his figure rocketed back, and the massive palm slammed into the ground with a rumble. Immediately… spider-web cracks quickly spread everywhere!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A visible white shock wave exploded from where the massive palm was! In the moment of eruption, everyone’s hearts trembled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no spiritual force whatsoever, but this shock wave… was actually at the realm of Great Circle Foundation Establishment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang bang bang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Without hesitation, Xu Yangyi, Rocjourney, Moonless, and the puppet all flew away thirty meters as the shock wave spread. Very swiftly, the palace unexpectedly followed with a rumble, and it split into countless pieces! They were all linked together with fine chains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A single palm… broke a palace hall that’s hundreds of meters all around! T-This is the Great Circle! A true Great Circle Foundation Establishment!” Rocjourney was dazed. Afterwards, his head snapped over to the old man chained in the plaza. No one had expected the power of Floatingcloud’s strike. Not only was it not weak, but it was instead comparable to when he was at the peak of his power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Running?” Floatingcloud cackled cruelly. In the next second, his massive palm transformed into a sky of spiritual light and vanished. Soon, this light formed into palm-sized vipers, all of them aimed at Bladevessel in midair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible!!!” Moonless’s eyes went round. As if he was telepathically linked with Rocjourney, the two of them stepped forward and cried out in alarm, “Creation! This is Creation! This is impossible! Any divine ability can only transform into a similar qi divine ability! How could material objects appear?!?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he can reach this step, then he’ll be at the realm of gods and immortals! Creation! Destruction! These are the legendary skills of gods!” As a bodhi seed of the twin sal-trees, Rocjourney found this matter harder to believe. He rocked his head back and forth and said in a shaky voice, “If he was able to reach this step, then he became an immortal long ago! This step… isn’t just the significance of a few snakes! But the difference of the Creator!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing is impossible.” Floatingcloud chuckled heartily. “In my domain,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;am the Creator!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">am an immortal! A god! An existence that you lot of swarming flies and aimless dogs are wholly unable to comprehend!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kneel, mortals!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t reply. The transformation of qi and living creatures, in a broad view of history… no, mythological history, only one person had achieved this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nüwa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qi could only transform into a qi divine ability. Once qi turned into a living being, even if it was a housefly, as long as it was a living creature, that was a transformation of nature! To tread into the scope of gods and immortals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But there’s another possibility…” Gaze like lightning, he gritted his teeth and looked to Floatingcloud. “But if that’s how it really is… then I’m afraid the danger this time is a whole lot bigger than what I predicted!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Legions of vipers surged towards Bladevessel like rolling thunder and flashing lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel’s complexion was incomparably grave. He hadn’t expected that Floatingcloud, having been trapped for centuries, would be this strange! The old man said he would attack and so he did! Without a trace of hesitation! Even though he himself had expressed that he was standing on Floatingcloud’s side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Earthmother’s Divine Art!” His hands weaved seals at a dizzying pace. Just as the countless vipers lunged towards him with the sound of piercing wind, yellow light glimmered in front of him, and a massive door loudly appeared with a flash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A resounding noise echoed, and the door crumbled apart in an instant. Bladevessel gasped coldly, and his hands transformed. A second door formed out of thin air. Still, another sky-shaking noise rang out, and the second door was broken again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The impact force of these little vipers was actually similar to a giant’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Still not enough!” Floatingcloud laughed gleefully. “If you want to be my hunting dog, then you must have a hunting dog’s ferocity! You’re nothing more than a Persian cat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His wizened left hand squeezed, and all the vipers promptly fell apart! They turned into motes of spiritual light again, and quickly gathered afterwards. This time, a massive black ax appeared! On the ax, there was a blood-red eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Destruction… Transformation in a weapon…” Eyes wide and mouth ajar, Rocjourney was already dumbfounded. “Could it be… Could he really have stepped into the legendary realm of immortals? No… No! All immortals in this world are legends! There’s no evidence that can prove their existence!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But granted that this man did, then it’s still actual history! Later on is the art processing! How could he break through to this step?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rocjourney suddenly felt a stab of pain in his mind. This was the sign of qi deviation, but he wasn’t to be blamed. While this scene before their eyes appeared simple, it had in fact already surpassed a boundary. This attack on his ideology was already affecting his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a refreshing qi moved into his qi sea, and he turned his head around appreciatively. Xu Yangyi’s hand was on the middle of his back. He silently nodded, yet the graveness in his heart was impossible to be rid of no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He absolutely hadn’t expected that Floatingcloud, whose qi sea had been ruined, would actually still be as fierce as when he was Great Circle Foundation Establishment centuries ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyways, how did he survive these past hundreds of years? Didn’t he outlive the lifespan for Foundation Establishment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rocjourney didn’t see that behind him, Xu Yangyi’s gaze was shimmering. The demon slayer seemed to be deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No… it’s a little like over doing things… like drawing legs on a snake… Why do I keep on feeling something is off…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s Great Circle Foundation Establishment. All he needs is one move to flatten all of us. Why use Bladevessel to establish his strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does he need Foundation Establishment cultivators? No way, a Foundation Establishment cultivator in themselves can’t injure him. Is he short of people? Even more unlikely. Does he even need anyone?” He intently observed Bladevessel and Floatingcloud’s fight. “There’s definitely some other reason in this… I just haven’t found it yet…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel took a deep breath, his expression terribly grave. His hands became a mirage, and seven giant doors formed behind him less than half a second later! They firmly protected him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chop!” Floatingcloud’s voice was like a great bell, and the ax struck downwards. Following Bladevessel’s roar, seven earthen-yellow hands suddenly extended from his seven great doors. Surprisingly, they doggedly held up the ax!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” A cold snort rang out, and a great shock traveled through Bladevessel’s entire body. A smidgen of blood spilled out from the crook of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Bladevessel was about to use his next divine ability, however, the strange giant ax, twenty meters in size, vanished into motes of spiritual light. His chest heaved up and down like a bellows, and he wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth, silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Floatingcloud said apathetically, “You, come over here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bladevessel was silent. Without a word, he walked over and stood at Floatingcloud’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deathly silence reigned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone, including Moonless, had adopted battle stances. Xu Yangyi’s Animus Armament was already unsheathed in his hand. From Rocjourney’s body, countless leaves grew out from under his skin. Some of these leaves were in bloom, bearing fruit, or wilted. Layers of white hair surfaced on Moonless’s hands. Even the three eyes of the puppet were emitting golden light, looking at Floatingcloud with great wariness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Circle Foundation Establishment… was enough to slay everyone here!</span></p>
