It was even a primary component for the Guyuan Elixir that Qi Condensation cultivators frequently used! <span id="footnote-ref-ff17"><a href="#footnote-ff17">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This toad had cooperated with Venture Pharmaceuticals for nearly a decade. From where did he get so much Dew Congealing Grass? There was only one answer. He possibly had some kind of field that ranked as a low-grade heavenly treasure. Otherwise, it was simply impossible for him to have provided a supply for an extended period of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Xu Yangyi bared blade and spear to force the youth to hand it over, the other wouldn’t be willing to in the least bit. This was his capital to survive. However, substituted with a seemingly tad coarse method, Xu Yangyi had a way to get the other to “voluntarily” hand it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Make the contract.” Xu Yangyi stood up, looking straight at the toad. The other tremblingly stood up and gritted his teeth, closing his eyes with resigned misfortune. His mouth opened shakily, and countless wisps of white qi slowly spilled out from his seven apertures. Congealing yet not scattering, the qi was like hazy mist, condensing into the form of a thumb-sized toad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi bit his hand and a drop of blood flew into the toad’s body. Instantly, a crisp and clear ribbit reverberated in the air, and the youth trembled all over. As if he had lost all of his blood, he fell to the ground with a wan complexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was filled with unparalleled regret. If only he had known earlier… Why did he have to go and provoke this fierce god? Not only had Xu Yangyi killed the berserker… but he had also escaped from the hands of Vermilion Snow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A single misstep, an error at each pace, this was cultivation… A minor mistake was enough for him, who had not been cautious enough, to forfeit his body. He powerlessly lied down on the floor, absent of a single trace of thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi waved his hand, and Zhou Tingting stood outside in shock. Just now, Xu Yangyi had isolated all sound within a meter of his surroundings. She could only see that he had opened his mouth to say something, yet she was unable to know what was said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“J-Just now, did he spit out his prime essence?” She looked at Xu Yangyi and lowered her head deferentially. “T-T-This is the first time I’ve seen something like this… Is it the same like what it says on the internet, where after you drop blood on it, you can control the life or death of a demon?” <span id="footnote-ref-1f26"><a href="#footnote-1f26">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It ordinarily exists in a demon’s qi sea. Demons aren’t the same us; they cultivate qi to condense their own qi’s appearance. Afterwards they refine out the impurities within it step by step and it finally becomes a demon core.” Xu Yangyi laughed as he said, “The stronger the demon, the greater the likelihood their prime essence will congeal and not disperse. It’ll even stay as it is two centuries after their death. So, remember, if you see the skeleton of a prehistoric greater demon later on, no matter what you do, don’t go inspecting it. Even if all that’s left behind is its prime essence, that’s enough to kill you ten thousand times over.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Once you sign a life-death pact, you can communicate with the pactee regardless of barrier. For example, you don’t have to talk, and as long as you think of something in your mind, the pactee will know via spiritual sense. However, the distance apart doesn’t go over a hundred meters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Tingting promptly nodded and soon after glanced at Xu Yangyi somewhat fearfully. She softly said. “Sir, how do you know so much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because I’m a professional.” Xu Yangyi kicked at the youth lying on the ground. “Name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Zongyuan…” The toad weakly replied, yet he had no choice but to forcefully rouse his spirit to stand up, carrying the hint of a smile even more unsightly than weeping. “Master, do you require the Dew Congealing Grass?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t expose his great killing intent again. Presently, so long as Xu Yangyi willed it, he could render him in a state where he no longer possessed the will to live but was denied the release of death. He had to wait… wait for an opportunity, wait for a chance to erase the other’s brand from his prime essence, and then when that time arrived...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would flee the country!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take out your savings first.” Xu Yangyi lit a cigarette yet didn’t take a drag of it. He looked at the ceiling and said, “Pick a good spot and buy a house. It has to be completely private and soundproof. Pick one with an underground garage and remodel it. I’ll be needing it in a week.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the moment where he was most short of funds to kickstart his operations, he had suddenly chanced upon Li Zongyuan who had once ran off from Sanshui City that year. The law of providence followed cyclically; it allowed respite, but never reprieve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this money… and a fully soundproof quiet place thrown into the mix...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next, he would cultivate the first part of the Eternal Alchemy Canon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the End of Days, natural resources were the greatest problem that constricted cultivators from making breakthroughs. However, since ancient times to the modern day, anyone who wanted to obtain even more resources only had a single path, and that was in their qualifications itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi remembered a matter, the one when he was on the plane. Hibiscus, Vulture, and Lilac had all said that they would open such conditions to the champions. However, to those with alchemy, artificing, and talisman Elysial Bestowments, the highest condition could reach thirty fold!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what if… this alchemy was genuine alchemy? What kind of conditions would they be willing to produce?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as for a cultivator who was ill-adept at utilizing their inborn advantages that wanted to reach the apex? Was this a dream? Which one of the figures that stood at those ten Core Formation positions wasn't an illustrious figure of the modern era? Or an unparalleled greater demon?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fire sparked and died away within his heart, but in the next second a feeling of danger caused him to swiftly narrow his eyes. There was someone… Someone in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three Qi Condensation cultivators. Two men and one woman… They were true killers, outstanding scouts, and while the odor of blood was masked rather well on them, their baleful auras were like an unusual flavor in the wind. After Xu Yangyi’s spiritual sense increased explosively, this aura could be no more distinct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a naked provocation towards him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Good…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He clenched his fists. Since this was a provocation, he reckoned he would fire back. A tiger trapped for three years was now a fierce tiger released from his cage. Whether or not he was still capable of the awe-inspiring might from three years prior was something he wished to know, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, he still thirsted for battle… He inhaled deeply and waved his hand towards Li Zongyuan. “Go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t move, but rather he sat in the room until the evening. Heavens Law didn’t teach much, but reconnaissance, counter-reconnaissance, and killing methods were given the heaviest weight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, there were four usages, one: to see if the other party was with or without intent. Presently, he could basically confirm that these three people, two men and one woman, were rushing towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party’s spiritual senses were nearly locked dead on him, and there was never a single person in the surroundings who was seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two: to probe out the other party’s intent. Was it surveillance or something else? He wasn’t quite certain on this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three: exhaust the other party’s strength. If they were at a disadvantage against him, it was because fasting couldn’t be accomplished at the initial stage of Qi Condensation. Scouts like this fundamentally wouldn’t be disturbed by starvation though. This was elementary.&nbsp;</span></p>

As if they were an insect’s compound eyes, they focused on the direction that Xu Yangyi had left.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>1. I generally dislike leaving things in pinyin, but I’m kinda hard pressed to in this case. Guyuan is an ancient medicinal food known for promoting various kinds of health benefits. It kinda looks like a solid black paste block with some white marbleization based on what you put in it. From my research, it is made from Longyan (chinese fruit, look up dragon eye fruit if you want to know more), black sesame, rice wine, donkey hide glue (traditional chinese medicine), walnuts, wolfberry, sugar, and red dates. It kinda looks like a brownie with all these nuts in it. <a href="#footnote-ref-ff17"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>2. 精元 - Prime essence. Also translated as original essence. This is part of an important concept in Daoism known as the “Three Treasures”. The three treasures being essence, qi, and spirit. <a href="#footnote-ref-1f26"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

 <div id="footnote-ef18">
  <p>3. Literal chinese here is “comeback weapon” - “Turn back the tide”. This didn’t really make sense to me in terms of the text, so I had to look it up. Closest thing I found was something related to Dota/LoL. It’s something along the lines of a “carry hero”, where you can just win the game solo if you’re good enough. I think. <a href="#footnote-ref-ef18"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

 <div id="footnote-e351">
  <p>4. Chinese here is literally “side door genius” I had some issues trying to translate this into something that sounds good, but I think crafts is decent. Whenever you see “side door” untranslated, know it’s related to the supplementary activities of alchemy, artifact refining, and talismans/formations. <a href="#footnote-ref-e351"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
