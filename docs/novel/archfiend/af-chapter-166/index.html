 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 166: Legionnaires (4)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xu Yangyi had finally been stirred in heart. He was aware of how fast his speed was, but unexpectedly, this assassin of the Reddust Executioners, Zhan Twelve, didn’t even fall a step behind him! This kind of speed simply didn’t belong to an ordinary genius!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding a squadron—besides himself—who else was even more suited… to be a scout candidate? He firmly remembered the three scouts of the major legions back then, even though he had disposed of them quite easily. However, their coordination and meticulous degree of execution was also rather boring to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now… this wasn’t even a scout. This was a dancer in the shadows! A shadow cultivator! Right before him… His scout position, would it have a candidate at long last?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful, Fellow Daoist.” At this time, a whisper entered Xu Yangyi’s ears. Amidst sparking flint, Zhan Twelve’s speed unexpectedly accelerated once more! In a flash, the great danger that was originally nailed straight on his back was actually neck to neck with him! Furthermore… it was a great danger that left him feeling terribly serious, covering the surface of his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chef Ding Dismembers Oxen!” <span id="footnote-ref-aeca"><a href="#footnote-aeca">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this instant, Xu Yangyi finally got a clean look at Zhan Twelve’s silhouette. It was quite strange, almost translucent. Not only was this a divine ability’s function, it was even paired with a special magik artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other’s blade, it was barely a third of a meter long and likewise semi-transparent! Perhaps an ordinary cultivator would’ve already had their throat slashed by this invisible reaper’s sickle. It wasn’t held in Zhan Twelve’s hand but rather “growing” from his palm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice carried the warning of “Chef Ding Dismembers Oxen”. Very soon, Xu Yangyi felt he was unable to escape! This was because each of his vitals were all being guided by that blade-sharp murderous will. It seemed as if he would be hacked to limbs in the next second by a frenzied blade!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This action gave Xu Yangyi the utmost satisfaction… Since Zhan Twelve had spoken, this move had materialized fatal danger and qi in no more than half a second! In other words, the assassin simply hadn’t made a hand seal! This move had already become ingrained in his reflexes! Instinct!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the stage, countless people coldly gasped and looked on with wide eyes. Zhan Twelve had become a glass man, but this glass man was not light like a feather. From the beginning, he’d trailed behind Xu Yangyi like a shadow. It caused them to become drenched in cold sweat. Xu Yangyi and Zhan Twelve hadn’t even made so much as a peep! It was like they were quietly watching a mime show of death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, the feather-glass abruptly flashed. Perhaps Xu Yangyi didn’t see, but they were able to! From all of Zhan Twelve’s joints, his throat, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles… sharp blades extended! As for Zhan Twelve himself, he’d early on become accustomed to this. Manipulating the blades with ease, he faced Xu Yangyi and cut down with his entire body!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not right…” Suddenly, a cultivator woke up from his reverie. “Even now… Commander Xu still hasn’t made a move?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A verse from this person who had broken out of his daydream and the other cultivators discovered that Xu Yangyi really hadn’t taken action once!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Under such pressing mortal danger… he’s not even making a move. That means…” Zhao Wuye inhaled coldly in disbelief. “H-He’s still maintaining absolute coolness now? A-And absolute self-confidence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye’s voice yet to fall, Xu Yangyi’s voice, neither slow nor swift, and obviously quite undisturbed, resounded throughout the entire audience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten Cardinals Red Lotus.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The instant that Zhan Twelve was on the verge of approaching his body, Xu Yangyi’s hands crossed over his chest, and a frightening spiritual pressure that caused all within the middle stage of Qi Condensation to cry out in alarm exploded from both his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However… it still wasn’t over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Life Sacrification!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Twin dragons went out to sea, doubling in power! Two screaming several-meter-long fire dragons suddenly encircled Zhan Twelve’s figure like twin dragons toying with the moon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A surprised cry echoed, hoarse and astonished. It was Zhan Twelve. He’d anticipated Xu Yangyi’s counterattack, but he hadn’t expected that this retaliation’s strength would be so wild and violent! Yet in an open confrontation, his divine ability was obviously not to his advantage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, it was too late. He was too close. Once the two fire dragons rushed forth, they quickly identified the target in front of them! They roared in fury and coiled towards his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Twelve’s temples were madly pounding He clearly understood that if he was wrapped around by these two things, the outcome… would be heavy injuries!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grafting Flowers On Tree!” A bellow without the slightest restraint followed! Zhan Twelve’s figure vanished from amidst the fire dragons without warning! Xu Yangyi’s gaze flashed and clearly discovered that the assassin had already landed a hundred meters away at an unknown point! <span id="footnote-ref-cce2"><a href="#footnote-cce2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Absolute silence, bereft of the loud cries of crows and peacocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two were unadulterated models that pure speed alone could cleave through all martial skills below the heavens! Previously, Xu Yangyi had started out all the same, but unexpectedly Zhan Twelve had caused him to feel numb for a few seconds. After Zhan Twelve grew used to Xu Yangyi’s speed, he suddenly burst forth, but was struck down by Xu Yangyi’s trap! On the edge of life and death, the assassin used Grafting Flowers On Tree to leave again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hundred meters away, Zhan Twelve’s complexion was sullen. If this was an assassination, he would’ve already failed. Most importantly, though… he deeply eyed Xu Yangyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man… was horrifically dreadful…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi seemed to erupt twice, but he understood very well that the other hadn’t dug into his full power! What level was he at now? 80%?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I concede,” Zhan Twelve hissed, “Many thanks.” He thanked Xu Yangyi for being lenient. Finished speaking, he didn’t even turn his head back as he walked down. He hadn’t received this fist, but as an assassin, he’d already failed. He wouldn’t be like Ge Qianqiu and shamelessly remain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist, wait a moment.” The instant Zhan Twelve turned around, Xu Yangyi’s smiling voice was heard from behind him. “The Xingtian Legion’s scout position is vacant. Wouldn’t it be better if Fellow Daoist was willing to accept this position?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence. After a couple seconds, the venue was a stretch of alarmed cries!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A recruitment! The first time the Xingtian Legion had spoke! The third person! The third person had finally obtained Commander Xu Yangyi’s recognition! A nod to recruit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Finally, a recruitment! Finally, a recruitment!” One cultivator’s expression appeared as if he’d been recruited, and he said excitedly, “I didn’t even think anyone could fight against this monster! So it turned out there really was someone, eh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah… That’s a freak… This Reddust Executioners’ guy sure is scary, but this Commander Xu is even scarier!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I almost thought that the word ‘genius’ wasn’t worth much… There actually was someone who was able to enter the Xingtian Legion’s discerning eye…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Twelve’s silhouette came to a fast halt. He took a quick glimpse at Xu Yangyi, in surprise. He obviously hadn’t received the final move, but also… only he knew that this commander was merely probing him. Ultimately, he’d then used a divine ability. Xu Yangyi was genuinely willing to recruit him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I recognize Fellow Daoist’s strength.” Xu Yangyi looked intently at the other and affirmed. “I am convinced in your power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The probationary period is three years. After three years, you’ll become a true legionnaire. In the Xingtian Legion’s planning, there will forever only be ten people. As for you, I hope you can become one of these ten people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each month, you will receive fifty medium-grade spirit stones. Irregularly, there will perhaps be a medicinal pill presented. I don’t risk guaranteeing the time. I also don’t guarantee there surely will be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the cultivators below, an untold number of eyes reddened! Fifty medium-grade spirit stones was a fair price, not much of a prize. However, the final condition was the guarantee which brought them all to converge here today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dao of Pills! The Dao of Pills! Only it could cause these organizations and powers to willingly deliver their genius successors to join the Xingtian Legion’s foundation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you willing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am willing!” Zhan Twelve had almost no misgivings whatsoever, promptly taking a knee and cupping his hands. “Starting from today, I, Zhan Twelve, belong to the Reddust Executioners and the Xingtian Legion. I will take the Xingtian Legion’s command as my chief objective and become one of the Xingtian Legion’s legionnaires!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded, and Zhan Twelve clasped his hands again. His mask left his present expression unseen. He simply pulled back to the side. The mood of the surrounding crowd of cultivators fired up enthusiastically again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each person’s breathing had unwittingly become heavy and coarse. Even the chests of quite a few cultivators were faintly heaving up and down. At this very time and moment, they had already collected their final scrap of a lucky break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first person had been recruited… Only nine positions remained! However, these nine positions were by no means an easy feat! At the beginning, they had believed a single fist not to be difficult, but after three people, not one person possessed such a thought!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fist… was very hard, extremely difficult to receive! This Commander Xu’s strength proved himself to be a Heavens Law provincial paragon! Worthy of being a disciple fancied by Daomaster Ancientpine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the strength of a Dao-Master Disciple?” The complexions of several clans ashened. A fist… No more than a single fist! Nonetheless… Xu Yangyi and Zhan Twelve’s battle had nearly eliminated more than half the applicants!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence. Excitement, expectation, and consideration amidst silence. In the end, after several minutes, a seemingly twenty-seven or twenty-eight-year-old youth leaped and cupped his hands. “Long Life Cave, Xiao Yaozi, please confer me your teaching, Fellow Daoist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time flowed past by the minute and second. Five hours went quickly. There wasn’t any cultivator who felt tired because in these five hours, seventy to eighty percent of the crowd had already been tested. At the same time, six cultivators had been selected among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Xueluan of Changbai Mountain’s Madame Poison had unexpectedly engaged Xu Yangyi in arcane combat for over a dozen minutes with her female body. Victory and defeat were indiscernible to either side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her arcane effort was exceptionally strange. She appeared tender and alluring, yet the inside of her body concealed countless poisonous puppets. Moreover, each one of them were kings of the five poisons. Even Xu Yangyi had no choice but to use the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus to isolate distance between him and her. <span id="footnote-ref-939b"><a href="#footnote-939b">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In particular… her medical arts were rumored to be even further above her poison arts. Although she herself didn’t make comment, she didn’t deny it at all. The position of squadron medic was headed by Qin Xueluan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this battle, Xu Yangyi had come forth with one fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bald man’s name was quite strange. He was known as Jun Man. This was the third cultivator that caused everyone present to deeply engrave him in their memories. Xu Yangyi’s full-powered fist penetrated the other, however, there was no blood, and the other’s body healed at an astonishing speed! <span id="footnote-ref-2130"><a href="#footnote-2130">[4]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was just this alone, perhaps Xu Yangyi wouldn’t have even chosen the other, but Jun Man’s divine ability was unexpectedly a wood-attribute divine ability and also leaning towards a supplementary divine ability. For example, he could turn all surrounding space within a few seconds into a web of plants. This web was so dense that not even air could get through, and it had a radius of several tens of meters. Without breaking through its core, the web could absolutely not be shattered. Paired with his nigh undying fleshly body, Jun Man became a candidate second to none to be a rearguard among troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cultivator likewise entered the combat troops by Xu Yangyi’s admiring nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this battle, Xu Yangyi had come forth with ten fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next was Quan Ningyue, a cultivator who enjoyed full-frontal collisions as much Xu Yangyi did. No one had even expected a cute, little girl could wield a sledgehammer. She gave rise to fierce and wild gales with each wave of her hammer. After the duo’s battle, the ground was filled with countless craters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quan Ningyue entered the combat troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle was still one fist.</span></p>

  <p>2. Grafting Flower On Tree - refers to a story of a minister during the Warring States period. He wanted his king to have an heir, so he offered many beautiful women, but there was no child. A passing man from another state heard about this minister’s problems, so brought his little sister and talked to the minister. The little sister consulted with her brother, and he decided to marry her off to the king and she gave birth to an heir. Because both brother and sister were people of the minister, the future descendants were all within the minister’s grasp. <a href="#footnote-ref-cce2"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
