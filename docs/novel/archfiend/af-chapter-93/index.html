God Ming bowed lowly. In an instant, the entire space stirred! It was a faintly undetectable and minute vibration, like the flapping of a dragonfly’s wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi sucked in deeply.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That this was a supreme treasure!</span></p>

It rended the time, space, and domain that descended here. Among the desolate will, even if it was a formless noise, it was enough to cause one’s heart to quake in fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go.” In the heavy mists, a soft and gentle voice rang out. Following the echo of a tremendous bang, the roar of some invisible creature, like it had been struck by a bullet, suddenly vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi pursed his lips. This power… While Jadewave’s definite realm still couldn’t be made out, all that was known… was that it was strong… extraordinarily strong! Perhaps… it was even stronger than Vermilion Snow! No wonder Jadewave held such confidence to take residence here. No mystery that it dared to seize the scenic cultivation land of the Four Great Joint Pools alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Four years ago, father obtained this picture scroll. In these four years, he was unable to decipher it. I request Senior Jadewave for an assisting hand.” God Ming said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe…” Within the heavy mists, laughter rang out, followed by the gurgling sound of water. “The Ming Clan is an inheritance of a thousand years. In the present world, it cannot be said to be in the top three noble demon clans, yet there exists no question it is in the top five… An item that all of you also cannot solve… is a bit interesting.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thick fog receded and the sheepskin paper immediately flew into the mist, vanishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi carefully watched all of this. Originally, it was Li Zongyuan that knew how to contact this old demon, but the other was now surprisingly approaching evolution. All in all, he found it necessary to be cautious and careful. Although the outside world’s legends had said Jadewave treated people cordially and so on, it wasn’t outlandish that not even ten thousand preparations were enough against such a millennium-old demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subsequently, he suddenly discovered that he couldn’t hear a thing! All that could be seen was God Ming and the tremendous black shadow within the heavy mists, who were talking about something. It seemed that his sense of hearing had been stripped of right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several seconds later, Xu Yangyi set his mind to ease. This should’ve been the transaction of Jadewave and one of God Ming’s successors. It was normal that he couldn’t hear it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at his watch again. Ten minutes had passed. In such a situation, he watched sixty minutes go by on his watch. After half of a two-hour period, a soft crumbling sound seemed to come from all around. Afterwards, his sense of hearing returned to his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it was. I didn’t expect it was actually such a thing…” God Ming’s complexion was suffused with an abnormal smear of red, and he bowed deeply. “Many thanks for dispelling the confusion, Senior! Past members of the younger generation were surely grateful to you!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe…” A dry laugh was heard from the heavy mists. “Junior of the Ming Clan, although this item is exceptionally precious, for the sake of your many unknown generations of deceased ancestors, I will remind you of two matters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One, the Heavenly Dao rewards the diligent. For gains to exist, there must be losses. Great opportunity is accompanied by great risk. This object is a supreme treasure, and you must also have the destiny to enjoy it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Two, presently, you are only a successor of God Ming. To merely rely on this item, and if you desire to become this era’s God Ming—and even break through to Core Formation—destiny is still required.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior will bear Senior’s instruction to mind.” God Ming cupped his fist. Soon after, he used a jade box to store the ancient scroll with extreme gingerness and put it in his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi narrowed his eyes. The middle finger’s ring. He inwardly memorized this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, it is your turn now.” In the thick mists, Jadewave turned its head and appeared to look towards Xu Yangyi. “Come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Xu Yangyi was about to take out the small half-chest, Jadewave suddenly spoke. “Halt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi stopped his actions. Followingly, he sensed a feeling within his body like soaring clouds and sailing mists as he flew straight into the heavy fog!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” God Ming’s gaze suddenly twinkled. The Ming Clan was an inheritance of a thousand years. There were some secret histories that only they knew. For instance…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless it was an item that outsiders couldn’t be permitted to see, Jadewave absolutely wouldn’t pull people before itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His own sheepskin scroll recorded the fragment of a world-shaking story, yet even this was taken out before outsiders. This boy… actually possessed an item even more precious than his own? A treasure that couldn’t be put forth or seen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord God.” An old man bowed and said, “Will we… be taking our leave immediately?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No…” A coldness grew within God Ming’s eyes, and he licked his lips. “Did you know…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Jadewave… has only ever cared for life or death on its own volcanic lake… however, Senior doesn’t care in the slightest for life or death that has departed these grounds!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I still have a debt to be reckoned with that ape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi flew into this mists, involuntary of his own will and freedom. After approximately ten seconds, he finally sensed he had come to a stopping point. Nonetheless… this stopping point was shockingly a location covered with scales, a tract no less than tens of meters in size!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This… was Jadewave’s palm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re very lucky.” Before he even opened his mouth, Jadewave’s voice, seemingly carrying a boundless, deep emotion, was heard from the mists. “This item… even gave me the thought of plunder. You truly… possess great destiny…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi’s footsteps slightly recoiled back a step, and he immediately heard Jadewave’s gentle laughter. “If I wished to pillage, you wouldn’t be standing here. Although this item has great destiny, the greater the destiny, the greater the challenge is more often than not. I am old and cannot enjoy such.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi looked at his watch, right on the dot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In the year 2000, China gathered the power of all biologists and geneticists to research and develop three ultimate Slaughter Weapons.” Jadewave said quietly, “They are true weapons of massacre. A single one can contend against a Core Formation master. This is one of the Chinese government’s trump cards. Each province’s Heavens Law avatar has the application to enable their privileges.”</span></p>

Aware of the many rare treasures. They wish to annex the cultivation world. As for the cultivation world, they have always looked down upon humanity as insects. If not for the nuclear bomb, a weapon of mass destruction, filling the skies and being created, the cultivation world would’ve long since killed their way to rivers of blood.”</span></p>

It is a cold war. Like that of the United States and the USSR. Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism stand on humanity’s side. They desire joss sticks, but nearly all cultivators revere themselves as the sole supremacy, believing themselves to be gods but offering no respects to the deities. What we cultivate is our own Dao, one’s own truth. The self approaches god. These three schools cultivate the Dao of the Joss Stick. Whatever the case, they also cannot let go of mankind. This is humanity’s second trump card.” <span id="footnote-ref-1540"><a href="#footnote-1540">[1]</a></span></span></p>

  <p>1. From what I was able to find, the Dao of the Joss Stick is a more abstract concept of what Jadewave is trying to say. It’s more along the lines of “worship”, since joss sticks are used in Chinese culture to pay respects to ancestors/gods. What Jadewave is pretty much saying is that the three schools desire worship, which is why they are bonded with humanity. <a href="#footnote-ref-1540"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>2. Liu Bang’s Snake-Beheading Sword is also known as the Red Firmament/Heavens Sword. Legend states that Liu Bang (256-195 BC) used this sword to behead a white snake. Liu Bang would lead the Han dynasty from 207-195 BC. The Realm-Inheritance Jade Seal is referring to the lost imperial seal of the Qing dynasty, modern-day China’s last dynasty. <a href="#footnote-ref-7724"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>3. Leave for immortality is used euphemistically to describe an emperor passing away. The literal words are “Dragon enters Dinghu”, however the story behind this refers to the Yellow Emperor essentially riding on a dragon to the heavens to become an immortal. I’m leaving some stuff out, but that's the gist of it. <a href="#footnote-ref-5adc"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
