The so-called cultivation to produce a core is in fact to ‘cultivate the Dao’. All cultivation systems from the Daoist school of Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, and the beginning of Core Formation. However, you can also say these days that ‘cultivation’ is in fact a type of thing, the Dao and the truth. There are two kinds of explanations. If the Dao is said to cultivate something, it is an internal alchemy system. The truth is said to be one’s comprehension concerning the Dao, the physical and the metaphysical…”</span></p>

Perhaps the self? The first thing that one does is the first thing that appears in one’s mind? The heart’s most original thought?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi pensively put his hand on the basement door and mumbled, “There are some cultivators where their devotion to upholding justice is their ‘truth’. There are some cultivators where even the favor of the heavens is insufficient for the drawing of a hair, yet this is also their ‘truth’...” <span id="footnote-ref-778e"><a href="#footnote-778e">[1]</a></span></span></p>

His expression wasn’t impatient but rather meticulous in reflection. She continued to softly speak, “However, there are also experts that say the ‘Dao’ and the ‘truth’ are actually a single kind of thing these days. It’s just that their interpretation is different. The Dao, according the explanation of experts, is a path. The truth is one’s true self. In reality, both are to advance onwards. Anyways, even in the last several thousand years, the debate of this academic theory still hasn’t been finished...”&nbsp;</span></p>

That in those years, there were actually two editions of The Harmony of the Trium, that is, The Eternal Alchemy Canon… The edition left behind was only for ordinary people to read, and Wei Boyang, as an ancestor-level figure in a Daoist alchemy sect, had the other cultivation arcane effort, which is carved on something… It’s said that even the name of The Eternal Alchemy Canon was blessed by Celestial Master Zhang, Zhang Fuhan, and was even taken by he himself…” <span id="footnote-ref-e612"><a href="#footnote-e612">[2]</a></span></span></p>

All of it’s rumors! Sir knows that there’s similar information like this on the news forums everyday! For every hundred articles there aren’t, there are eighty that are! That’s really what I’ve heard!”</span></p>

Those words had sent his heart rate pumping. The arcane effort inside the chest that he owned was the Eternal Alchemy Canon! Even Daomaster Floatingcloud’s Burning Heavens Revelation was born from this arcane effort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After experiencing the mysterious lotus pond, the Burning Heavens Revelation had expanded no less than ten fold in characters. If said the single portion of the over-a-dozen-times-expanded Eternal Alchemy Canon was enough to create the modern cultivation world’s treasured Burning Heavens Revelation, then, as the hidden edition of The Harmony of the Trium, it was at least absolutely impressive to the modern cultivation age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re pretty interesting.” After he swept his eyes over Zhou Tingting, he immediately pushed open the basement door. At the same time, in his heart, he had already come to a resolve. Once he left seclusion, he wouldn’t mind guiding her for a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even in death, this girl would insist on preserving her honor. And while her aptitude was rather high, it wasn’t on the same level as his by any measure. However, she had a strong point.</span></p>

[ref八卦 - Eight Trigrams. Important concept in Daoism. Kinda hard to explain, but it's an idea of the interpretation of the cosmic on the real world. Heavily involved with topics such as “Feng Shui”, Geomancy, Anatomy, Astrology, etc.[/ref]</span></p>

There were no other items. However, the surrounding limestone was carved with a talisman he was exceptionally familiar with.</span></p>

It was a simplification of the Spirit Focusing Formation and its efficacy was estimated to be only a twentieth of a low-grade Spirit Focusing Formation. However, its advantage was that it didn’t require spirit stones.</span></p>

The Spirit Drawing Formation only caused a thin layer of milky-white mist to appear on the floor. If a normal person entered this stone room, they would certainly feel extremely comfortable and their ailments would completely vanish. But for Xu Yangyi, a genius cultivator, it merely made him feel that the old wounds on his body had improved a bit.</span></p>

The incredibly familiar Hundred Solutions instantly bubbled forth in his mind. His thoughts seemed to bob up and down again as if they had entered a spirit spring, and each one of his pores comfortably opened.&nbsp;</span></p>

Rather, it was on account of his ability to use his superhuman talent to survive and cultivate to the Great Circle of Foundation Establishment!</span></p>

Yet at this moment, all of them turned completely gold and beeped. The massive “Incapable of Assessment, Tracking Failed” message was terribly piercing to the eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The room was deathly quiet.

He was still wearing a changpao, and his long white beard fluttered on his chest as before. However, both of his eyes had turned incomparably icy since the beeping noise had started to ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have been cultivating for 112 years…” His fairly hoarse voice rang out in the room. “Five years ago, I ended my 21-year seclusion.” What he said was irrelevant, but not a single one of the present people dared to answer. Even the secretary at his side was bowing at the waist, drenched in cold sweat. “I don’t understand the internet. But, I do understand one thing.” He suddenly walked over to an employee’s side and patted the latter’s swivel chair, faintly laughing. “And that’s if you don’t understand, then hand it over to a professional. Right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes…” As the the old man spoke, the employee didn’t dare to look straight at him.</span></p>

Everyone now stood up together and orderly bowed as if they had conspired to do so, causing the short old man to appear a good deal taller. He seemed to be a crane amidst a flock of chickens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no response and only after a few seconds passed did they hear the old man murmur, “Stand up.”</span></p>

  <p>2. Celestial Master Zhang is a real figure. In fact, his bloodline has even been traced down to this day, albeit with some current succession conflicts. All the names I wrote down all belong to the same person. Chinese figures (especially ancient ones) get different names (courtesy, etc). Celestial Master Zhang is considered a major Daoist figure.
