Personally watching these characters enter the bamboo scroll of golden light, he looked on as if a pair of incorporeal hands were automatically arranging the script in the sky. After everything was sorted and increased, the result saw that no character was the same!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a faint voice chimed out from some unknown location. “Return… to…” The voice was leagues away but extremely rich in cadence. When this chiming echoed, the color of the sky suddenly blackened!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, a lotus ignited with a shining blaze. Subsequently, the lotus flower instantly burst into fire like it had been doused with gasoline! It wasn’t confined to this lotus… but rather… the entire lotus pond!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Craaaacckle…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In a wink, half of the sky reflected the redness of flames, bringing the lotus flower ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see to shine like daytime! On the water’s surface, the reflections of flames all gently swayed! It appeared that the lotus pond water was boiling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi wasn’t alarmed. He stared unflaggingly at the bamboo slip in the sky. Whether or not this situation could be explained, was the Burning Heavens Revelation just a badly ruined secret law? If explained… was it originally this never-before-heard-of Eternal Alchemy Canon? If clarified… wasn’t this a true arcane effort lost to the long river of history?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Heavens Revelation was already a Core Formation arcane effort. If that was so… what level was this completed Eternal Alchemy Canon? No… It wasn’t limited to just that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi sucked in deeply. From his experiences starting from the branch academy to the graduation ceremony, he was already aware as to what extent modern Alchemy Dao had fallen to. As for this arcane effort… was it possibly an alchemy one? A supplementary arcane effort?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All kinds of doubts arose in his heart. When he was in the Unrivaled Beneath the Heavens Arena, he could’ve taken the pledges of the great powers and clans at any time he desired. But in comparison to his present harvest and the complete activation of the mysterious half-chest, their promises were like firefly light contrasted to a luminous moon, unable to be mentioned together on any grounds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he carefully observed each character, countless bubbles suddenly erupted from underwater!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit!” Without a second word, Xu Yangyi gritted his teeth and got down on his stomach on top of a lotus leaf. In the sea of lotuses, perhaps such a large movement had long since disturbed the terrifying prehistoric beast below!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">SWOOSH!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A massive wave that could flood the heavens overturned the sky. A fish tail, no less than a thousand meters long, whipped out from the sea of lotus leaves! Under the flames, the azure fish scales glimmered with a devilish brilliance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fish tail rose up, blotting out the sky and concealing the earth! This simply couldn’t be a creature that could appear on Earth! Even if it was the legendary kraken of the North Sea, it was impossible to have such tremendous mass!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky’s brilliance was covered by the fish tail, serving as a deathly still black cloth that covered the surface. Countless lotus leaves and lotuses were sent flipping through the air in the wake of this gigantic mountain range-like fish tail. With a rumble, an explosive tide climbed up a hundred meters high like a tsunami! It charged directly at the bamboo scroll of golden light in the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Kun Peng flaps its wings, whirlwinds and tornadoes would arise within 90,000 li. It shouldered the azure skies to look down below at the city walls of the human realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From extremely large to extremely small, Xu Yangyi’s pupils suddenly shrunk. He could already imagine that as the fish tail fell, a mega tsunami would erupt from the entire sea of lotuses! He was like a withered leaf within torrential rains, facing imminent crisis!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huff…” Life and death hanging in the balance, Xu Yangyi suddenly closed his eyes. He seemed to hear a crash, and the entire landscape before his eyes shattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump… Thump…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The violent beating of his heart seemed to resonate at the side of his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoooosh…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Heavy rain downpoured, striking his eyes and wetting his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vrooooom…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The sound of a car raced by from a not-so-distant location. His camouflage pants were already soaked in the heavy rain. He immediately felt a fiery pain from the injuries on his bare upper body. His entire skeleton seemed to be broken, and he couldn’t even summon an iota of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His present location was a small mountain at the side of a highway. There were trees growing all over, and he just happened to be on a hilltop. From this location, a few vehicle headlights could be seen on the highway and a nearby thinly spread metropolitan area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below, not a skyscraper could be seen, representing that the lighting magnitude of the population concentration was frighteningly sparse. At least, that was what Xu Yangyi who had just been at Fengyi City believed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh…” He exhaled with trepidation, and his heart pounded fiercely. The scenery moments ago seemed to be just before him. He could even still clearly remember the thousand-meter-long fish tail that could overturn rivers and seas, as if that landscape was a natural disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed to have been a lifetime ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was that scene just now real or fake? Was that experience an illusion or fantasy? If it was a fantasy, why did he remember everything so clearly? Nevertheless, it wasn’t important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He tested out his qi sea; it was completely void. On the contrary, though, the bullet in his chest had faded away, but his current “reserve” of qi was almost nil. With such grave injuries, and without qi to mend his body, Xu Yangyi knew that if he laid down here that while he wouldn’t die, he would surely come down with a serious illness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gritting his teeth, he turned over. Facing the torrential downpour of the night sky, a weak smile surprisingly hung from the corner of his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehehe…” He began to only laugh gently, but finally he faced the heavens and howled in laughter, “HAHAHA!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything else was unimportant. What was important was that he’d survived. From the midst of hellish tempering, he had survived! All the Foundation Establishment cultivators had been exterminated and the amount of dead Qi Condensation cultivators and mortals numbered in the thousands. It could be said this was the first major incident in close to thirty years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had continued to live, and moreover, even ruthlessly beat up Vermilion Snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A painful sensation passed through his entire body, ceaselessly reminding him that this was proof of his existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huff…” He inhaled deeply, feeling strength slowly return to his body. Familiar qi began to bore into his qi sea strand by strand, and he shut his eyes. His first order of business wasn’t to circulate his arcane effort but rather immediately arrange his thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being the first place of a branch wasn’t so simple. He had to be outstanding countless of times in live combat training. He was tossed alone on uncharted islands filled with demons an unknown number of times.

It had caused his qi sea to expand limitlessly. While he presently couldn’t figure it out, it even provided him with some advantages. However, following the progressive increase of his realm and the increasing depth of his cultivation, it was akin to drinking poison to quench thirst!</span></p>

Just as he turned his head, a boy wearing a high schooler’s uniform suddenly appeared from the parted area. To say it was a boy was not completely correct.</span></p>

The boy’s shock lasted for less than half a second, and his first response was to let loose a low wolf’s howl from his throat.

The boy’s transformation just now… was simply outrageously weak. Even if he only had one percent of his qi right now, he wouldn’t even need thirty seconds to handle the thing before him. That was, if it dared to take the initiative to attack.</span></p>
