 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 181: Entering the Secret Realm</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked icily at the white-haired man and suddenly laughed as well. “What number are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am the twelfth-ranked God Ming,” the white-haired man laughed comfortably and elegantly cupped his hands in ceremony. “In the secret realm, I look forward to Fellow Daoist’s many, many pointers.” His gaze fell on the storage ring on Xu Yangyi’s figure. “To take something without telling is called stealing. Presumably, when the Old Ancestor sees that I have returned this item to its original master along with Fellow Daoist Xu’s skull, it will surely be a great comfort to his mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words were undisturbed, even similar to two old friends, long-acquainted soul brothers, chatting. However, the killing intent in these words were without the least bit concealment. Their gazes were like blades clashing in the air yet died away in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How nice.” Eventually, Xu Yangyi laughed and nodded. “I haven’t taken a life in a long time. I’m itchin’ a little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Ming Twelve smiled as he bowed slightly, his etiquette bereft of fuss. “In that case, I hope Commander Xu can stay alive until we meet, yes?” His long and narrow gaze flashed with a wisp of killing intent, and he sneered, “I… am like someone searching for their lover, foolishly tracking down Fellow Daoist Xu’s footprints.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them laughed and cupped hands, taking each other’s name and placing it upon the executioner’s platform within their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ming Clan…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Within Xu Yangyi’s seemingly tranquil gaze was icy coldness, impossible to be rid of. He could avoid Foundation Establishment seniors, but as for those of the same rank in the Qi Condensation realm… he truly wasn’t afraid of anyone!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist just said that this secret realm only permits Qi Condensation to enter?” he laughed and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Ming Twelve feigned an appearance of of surprise. “Fellow Daoist is unaware?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As a Core Formation master’s disciple, Fellow Daoist is actually unaware?” He looked Xu Yangyi up and down, full of interest. “This was news from the day before last, otherwise, why does Fellow Daoist think that besides the present Foundation Establishment cultivators upholding order, there are only a few insignificant Foundation Establishment? It appears that your position in Daomaster Ancientpine’s eyes is just a wave to summon and a beckon to go. But, this too is no great hindrance. After all, at the latest tonight, your Master-Ancestor Ancientpine will announce this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crook of Xu Yangyi’s mouth curved upwards. “You’re not scared of Master-Ancestor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I’m scared. I’m scared to death.” God Ming Twelve approached a bit more and said coldly, “But now is Cultivation Civilization, not the Ancient Cultivation age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded. “I like your manners.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Regarding the dead, the Ming Clan naturally cannot howl like those lucky, wild dogs. With our status in the Five Great Demon Clans, it’s proper to maintain respect for a dead man. Wouldn’t you say? Commander Xu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi beamed with smiles as he extended his hand. “If you say so. In that case… we’ll be seeing each other in the secret realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the secret realm we will.” God Ming Twelve smiled and used his gilded folding fan to block Xu Yangyi’s hand. “But… even if I was more respectful, I couldn’t possibly shake hands. Shaking hands with a dead man is too much bad luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finished speaking, he departed in perfect satisfaction. Xu Yangyi indifferently watched the view of the other’s back, and Mao Ba’er came over and asked, “Your butt buddy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhm,” Xu Yangyi casually answered with a hum and stowed his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your butt buddy is very flashy,” Mao Ba’er sighed wistfully. “Also, I’ve got no choice but to remind you, but the Ming Clan ranks as one of demonkind’s Five Great Clans. The ones entering this time certainly aren’t just a single twelfth seed. I’m afraid the strength of the true apex clans is beyond your imagination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A single blade to behead.” Xu Yangyi remained completely unmoved and nodded towards the legionnaires. “Everyone, rest up well. We’ll be entering Danxia Temple soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time drifted by rather quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t rest whatsoever but rather immediately contacted Zhao Wuye. After Jadesun found him, he notified the other at once. Presently, Zhao Wuye ought to have been around since earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the Zhao Clan was still few in number, but they were able to enter the clans here with the status of a non-first-rate clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye answered very swiftly. Right now they couldn’t enter; the secret realm had still yet to fully form. As soon as the secret realm completed its materialization, he would come find the Xingtian Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, Xu Yangyi carefully inspected the items that should’ve been brought once over. It wasn’t until he verified that the equipment was all in order did he begin to meditate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown how long it had been. He suddenly furrowed his brows and opened his eyes. “Qi… My spiritual sense connection has been severed?” He studied his hand, fairly confused. “My misperception?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Testing again, there still wasn’t any feeling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” His gaze twinkled as he looked outside. “Not severed… but coming from an overwhelming interference!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the qi and spiritual sense within his body seemed to encounter its natural predator, tightly suppressed within his body! And yet… he could clearly feel a supremely terrible qi orb outside! It was swiftly taking shape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander!” Not even waiting for him to gain a clear understanding, Mo Yeyu rushed in. “It’s about to open! It’s about to open!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s eyes shimmered. With a tiger’s leap, he stepped quickly and moved outside. “How long have you been meditating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A day and seven hours!” Mo Yeyu’s baby face carried the faint flush of excitement. He spoke and answered with great urgency, and his actions were even faster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any dialogue, Xu Yangyi almost dashed outside the tent in two steps. Outside, the color of the sky was already dark, however, even a darker sky still wouldn’t have been able to shelter the rays of red light cast down from the thick clouds of the night. Moreover… everyone was incapable of ignoring the tremendous maelstrom that spun like the wheel of fate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This vortex was already completely different from what Xu Yangyi saw a while ago. At this moment… it was devoid of a sliver of iron-gray color! Instead it transformed into a kind of milky-white!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rays of silken qi continuously rose from within yet fell back in. The current vortex didn’t have the slightest odd appearance but rather became incredibly pure and holy. It appeared like a sacred lake suspended in the air, set up right!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secret realm… was on the verge of finishing its evolution!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The boundless secret realm was like a mirror erected between heaven and earth, shrouding the world. A person standing in front of this vortex couldn’t even be considered a speck of dust!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palaces and crowds of tents below the mirror seemed as minuscule as ants in contrast. Yet in front of the mirror were countless “mosquitoes”!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They wasn’t mosquitoes but rather swarms of cultivators. Already, magik treasures ascended into the air, and flying magik artifacts calmly awaited the secret realm to finish materializing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Densely packed together, they appeared as tiny as mosquitoes beneath the illumination of milky-white qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown how long it had been. Perhaps it was an hour or even longer. In a moment which none had anticipated, all of a sudden the tremendous qi vortex exploded with a wave of white light that rendered one unable to look straight at it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a twinkling, there only existed light between heaven and earth! It resembled the instant an atomic bomb exploded, the kind of extremely bright light that caused retinas to rupture!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Endless shadows were distantly cast faraway. This brilliance persisted for ten seconds until it was finally extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi tightly shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and solemnly opened them. In the next second, even he was unable to restrain himself from sharply exhaling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A door to heaven!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tremendous maelstrom had transformed into a door to heaven! It was no less than a thousand meters tall! 200 to 300 meters wide!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A look upwards was unable to capture its height. A turn of the head was unable to witness its length. It was like a great qi mountain towering in Red Willow Gully! Majestic without peer! Anyone who looked upon this scene would only feel shock in their hearts towards this great boundless extreme!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present scene was absolutely silent, absent of the peacock’s cry or the crow’s caw. Among humanity’s Seven Noble Lineages, demonkind’s Five Great Clans, and the Three Great Sects, not one person spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Between the two enormous one-sided stone doors was an expanse of sparkling and pure whiteness. It was the purest qi! A qi already purified to the extreme! At the same time… it was also the entrance of Danxia Temple’s secret realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“GO!!!” In the sky, an excited roar suddenly erupted, and a wave of hearty laughter facing upwards was heard in the air. “Our Nangong Clan will be the first to step in! Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the Five Great Demon Clans, the Nangong Clan, moved into action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice seemed to be the dragon boats’ command during the Dragon Boat Festival! Subsequently, countess tiny black dots arrived in front of this door. Perhaps they were demon familiars, simply unrecognizable, or perhaps they were flying magik artifacts, diverse in both color and form, but at this moment, they exploded with rays of soaring treasure light! They charged towards the entrance in a frenzy! <span id="footnote-ref-3404"><a href="#footnote-3404">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuanyuan Demon Clan! Xuanyuan Gongyu! All Fellow Daoists make a path!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beijing’s Xu Clan will be the first to step forward! Hahaha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xichuan’s Baili Clan shall take the path!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nanhe’s Zhou Clan, come with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the sky was flowing with light and brimming with color, a rich variety of shades and tones. Fireworks one after another in succession, stars falling like rain! The east wind night set with colored lanterns like a thousand blooming flowers! <span id="footnote-ref-245b"><a href="#footnote-245b">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this tremendous door, there wasn’t one clan still able to maintain calmness. Elites from the clans, true geniuses, carried their own power and rushed inside with all their might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single step faster… It was quite possible that each step was to be faster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, blazing colors of endless purple and red qi shined on the faces of those below to become multicolored. Yao Xintan’s eyes reddened, his voice hoarse as he looked at Xu Yangyi and yelled, “Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No rush.” Xu Yangyi’s eyes were also flushed somewhat red, and he tightly bit his lip a few times, restraining his emotions to immediately charge in and look around as to what it was like beyond this door. He turned his head and said to everyone, “The path we’re walking is different from theirs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That which Fellow Daoist says is very true.” Just as Xu Yangyi’s voice fell, twenty people emerged from the darkness. At the lead was Zhao Wuye. His expression was solemn as he cupped his hands. “It’s unknown what kind of creatures are beyond the giant door. As for where we’re going, it is quite possibly a place leading to the true entrance of Danxia Temple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our path is much more direct, convenient, and faster than the others! Much more faster! Why walk into this entrance that we know nothing at all about the inside?” Behind Zhao Wuye, Zhao Ziqi and a tall, thin middle-aged man followed. The man laughed, his voice bright, “With the Zhao Clan’s centuries of great effort, how can we enter an incomprehensible door?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will make an introduction for Fellow Daoist.” Zhao Wuye deeply cupped his hands. “This is Zhao Mingfeng, late stage of Qi Condensation and the clan’s second elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Fenglai, peak middle-stage Qi Condensation. The Zhao Clan’s majordomo.” A fat man repressed his extreme excitement and cupped hands, worrying about his etiquette as much as possible. “Commander Xu, I’ve looked forward to meeting you for a long time. It is indeed the Zhao Clan’s good fortune to be able work together with you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The others are all the Zhao Clan’s elites.” Zhao Wuye licked his lips. “There’s no time to lose; we’ll move out straightaway!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t say anything, nodded, and immediately followed. However, he turned his head and discovered there were quite a few legionnaires who hadn’t moved. On the contrary, their expressions were odd and unnatural. “What’s up with you guys?” he furrowed his brows and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one spoke, but after a few seconds, Gao Wuguo said in a trembling voice, “Commander… you… did you say… that you suspect a path leading to Danxia Temple’s true door… is real?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Naturally!” Zhao Fenglai was a seemingly young and refined man who wore glasses and camouflage. He turned his head and laughed, “In respect to the Zhao Clan’s great efforts for the past several centuries… and earth masters of centuries, don’t tell me it’s fake?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the legionnaires were stunned! It was true! It was actually true! They weren’t walking into the giant door but rather a path leading directly to Danxia Temple’s suspected true entrance! Heavens… The true door of one of the Eight Great Deadlands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys…” Xu Yangyi looked at them suspiciously. “Didn’t think I was making a joke back then, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s because we thought you were joking!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone took a quick glance, curling their lips but not saying anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words said back then were obviously to stir their moods! Danxia Temple’s true door… How many cultivators were unable to access it and enter? They’d thought Xu Yangyi was rousing morale! Who fucking knew that this door to heaven wasn’t actually going to be entered now! Unexpectedly, such a path truly existed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet shortly, their embarrassment vanished without a trace. It was substituted with incomparable excitement! Danxia Temple’s true door! How many people had once entered it?! Now… they held this chance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the cultivators ahead were ultimately still able to arrive there, what of their degree of safety? Time? On no grounds could it be compared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking upon the crowd’s expressions, Xu Yangyi turned around, and his hand raised up into the night sky. His voice was like the horn of soldiers and officers going into battle. Deep and low, it carried a flavor that bewitched hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Willing to take the sword at waist and behead Loulan for country! Xingtian Legion…” His hand suddenly chopped downwards, and a sound like a metal sword unsheathing resounded powerfully, “Set out!!!” <span id="footnote-ref-3603"><a href="#footnote-3603">[3]</a></span></span></p>

  <p>3. Poem from our favorite poet Li Bai. I usually translate poems these days based on context, but the tricky thing about this is that Xu Yangyi actually says this outloud. A little history behind this poem is the ancient city of Loulan (Chinese name) also known as Kroraina. It was located around an important oasis on the Silk Road (ancient trade route that stretched to Persia/China). Throughout history, the Chinese ruled over it intermittently. In history, the King of Loulan was assassinated, hence the “behead”. Loulan was active mostly (200 BCE - 600 CE). The general intent of this poem is like “Let’s go!!!!” <a href="#footnote-ref-3603"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
