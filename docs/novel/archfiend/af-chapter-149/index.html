 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t know how to answer. He did fancy the fingernail-sized green leaf, but that was bound to displease Daomaster Titanspirit. Daomaster Yue… appeared kindhearted and open but was also sinister and nefarious. Yet wasn’t making an agreement with Daomaster Titanspirit squeezing in a person at his own side? This was an absolute impossibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehe…” As he pondered how to respond, hollow laughter suddenly echoed. “You two really are practiced hands at playing a good show, but have you asked us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wizened voice rang out again, “Fellow Daoist Titanspirit, what are your intentions by bringing a person to the pill master’s side? Before so many Seniors, are you still wanting for honor and respect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daomaster Titanspirit was without the slightest concern. He laughed heartily, the skin of his face comparable to a city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However… I was planning on comprehending this pill by myself.” The wizened voice curbed its dry laughter and said prudently, “It just so happens that I also have a magik treasure in my hand. I also intend to estimate its valuation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Following a flash of golden brilliance, the golden light swiftly transformed into a great domain shortly afterwards! In less than three seconds, it immediately transformed the whole room with golden light! Even Daomaster Yue’s tremendous golden hand was pressured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, a mighty pressure, boundless like seas, forced all the Foundation Establishment cultivators below to sit down with a thud. In uncertain alarm, they looked towards the golden heavenly kingdom in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” These cultivators didn’t speak, but suddenly, several startled voices were heard from the pavilions overhead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xu Yangyi’s heart suddenly throbbed because this sensation… was too familiar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor Armament! This was an Emperor Armament! Nonetheless, compared to his, it lacked a kind of vitality and instead was dead in spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The whole sky flashed with golden light. Several great characters forged from qi were faintly discernible in the light. After an unknown passage of time, the expanse of golden light finally revealed its true form, that of three incredibly simple tomes which carried a heavy grandeur!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Buddha’s…” Ancestor Hiddenscent’s voice echoed. At this instant, even her voice carried a hint of astonishment. “Forty-Two-Chapter Sutra?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Authenticity guaranteed.” The wizened voice burst into laughter, “Emperor for all eternity, Qing Shengzu, Kangxi the Great’s manuscript, Buddha’s Forty-Two-Chapter Sutra. Everyone, how about this item?” <span id="footnote-ref-eb05"><a href="#footnote-eb05">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the Foundation Establishment cultivators below, it was simply impossible for them not to know what an Emperor Armament was. However, by merely looking at this terrible mighty pressure that was comparable to Core Formation, they could sense that this item… was perhaps not a magik treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist,” Daomaster Skybearer’s voice echoed for the third time, still as grave as the first time. “Do you know… how sinful it is to privately conceal this object?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehehe… Fellow Daoist Skybearer, your fame and prowess can be said to be thunder piercing the ears… but even though Fellow Daoist is half-step Nascent Soul, perhaps all of you combined wouldn’t be able to obstruct me if I wanted to leave.” The wizened voice laughed eerily, “Maybe you even somewhat recognize my arcane effort from a while ago. Do not use the Cultivation Court to pressure me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, Skybearer didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W-Who is this person?” Below, an unknown number of people were in a state of boundless shock. “He actually even dares to talk this way to humanity’s greatest battle power?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for this item,” the wizened voice laughed grimly. “Lord Shengzu personally granted it to me, yet I hadn’t once foresaw that under the coincidence of destiny that it would surprisingly transform into its current form.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Besides, it’s of no great use to me, but for a Qi Condensation cultivator… Hehehe, at the very least, it can keep one alive from the hand of a Core Formation master for an hour!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each and every seat erupted in a storm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every great realm was a qualitative leap! Foundation Establishment to Qi Condensation was a steam roll. Below Core Formation, all were moreover insects without exception! On that day, the half-step Core Formation Vermilion Snow’s massacre of several thousand cultivators was the best proof of that! Nonetheless… there was actually an object able to protect a Qi Condensation from the hand of a Core Formation ancestor for an hour? And even “at least”?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not just this…” the wizened voice continued to speak, “This item can slay Foundation Establishment like slaughtering chickens and killing dogs. Altogether, it possesses ten opportunities. Every time, it will cover a perimeter of fifty kilometers! It will only kill spiritual sense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The floor was morbidly still. A silence like death. No one whatsoever had foreseen the third Core Formation would unexpectedly dispense such a magik treasure! Was there a better item… that could compare to one’s own life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W-What the heck is this item?” A Foundation Establishment cultivator looked on in shock at the three tomes radiating golden light in the sky. “In this world… how could such a heaven-defying object exist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silent for an unknown period of time, Daomaster Skybearer’s voice finally sighed faintly, “I have an approximate understanding of who you are…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Hehe?” the wizened voice laughed even more cheerfully. “In this world, I’m afraid that besides from myself, no one knows…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liang Jiugong.” <span id="footnote-ref-bfb6"><a href="#footnote-bfb6">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wizened voice’s laughter came to an abrupt grunt. As it spoke again, it carried a trace of shock for the first time. “You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do I know?” Daomaster Skybearer smiled faintly. “Qing Shengzu’s Grand Supervisor, High Eunuch Liang Jiugong… In the Yongxian Records, it is recorded ‘Grand Supervisor High Eunuch Liang Jiugong of the prior reign hung himself at Jingshan Garden’. I didn’t expect… you actually faked your death and escaped… To have stayed alive up to now… and to be capable of leaving your name in history books, should I call you Liang Jiugong… or the frequently heard ‘Li Dequan’ from mortal television dramas?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At long last, the wizened voice didn’t speak. After an unknown passage of time, he gritted his teeth and said, “Fellow Daoist, WHO are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe…” Skybearer’s voice floated pass like clouds and winds. “Nothing more than an acquaintance…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An acquaintance? In their hearts, all the cultivators on the floor were endlessly shocked. A Core Formation cultivator’s identity was their greatest secret. This unrecorded Core Formation ancestor was surprisingly an old monster who had lived through the past several eras! And yet Daomaster Skybearer… actually called the other an acquaintance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This object was indeed bestowed to you. I will bother about it no further.” Skybearer’s voice faded away, but Daomaster Liang’s voice didn’t emerge again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three treasures emitted a thousand rays of prismatic light, cutting across the sky. They caused the audience’s eyes to dazzle with blossoming flowers, dizzy in a state of awe. However, the fanfare wasn’t finished at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately following, from Ancestor Hiddenscent’s pavilion, a five-colored, roughly fist-sized stone, similar to jade yet not jade, was quietly flown out on a tray by a maid. Her gait lithe and graceful, she governed the wind to soar into the skies unaided. The maids of a Core Formation ancestor were all Foundation Establishment seniors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stone merely seemed nice-looking, but as the female cultivator’s voice echoed, countless Foundation Establishment cultivators exhaled sharply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenmend Stone.” <span id="footnote-ref-1cc8"><a href="#footnote-1cc8">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fifty years ago, Ancestor Hiddenscent explored one of the eight deadlands, the Kunlun Mountains’ Death Valley. A kilometer away from the valley’s heart, she obtained it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In this campaign, all 742 female cultivators of Ancestor Hiddenscent’s Towering Flowersnow Sect perished in battle. Master High Priestess Fluttersnow and High Priestess Primeyin met their demise 1.1 kilometers away from the heart of Death Valley. 717 Qi Condensation disciples returned to silence 300 meters from the mouth of the valley. 28 Foundation Establishment cultivators fell in a zone near Death Valley’s heart. Ancestor Hiddenscent escaped unscathed. This item is one of the few she gained from the trip to this secret realm.”</span></p>

  <p>1. In Buddhism, the Forty-Two-Sutra-Chapter is considered the translated text that introduced Buddhism to China. Translated by the Indian monks Ksayapa Matanga and Dharmaratna. Qing Shengzu lived from 1654-1722 CE. <a href="#footnote-ref-eb05"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>2. Liang Jiugong - Based on a real person. Most of his history is described in his little intro. For a little more proof of his identity as “Li Dequan”, please see the wikipedia entry Kangxi Dynasty. During the Qing dynasty, he was regarded as an extremely powerful eunuch in a period where most believed the power of the eunuchs were no more.

  <p>4. “Imperial Heavens Tusita Decree” Another extremely difficult name to translate. Doing the research for this was murder and then so was coming up with a good name that wasn’t clunky. The literal name is “Emperor Palace Heaven Prophecy Tusita True Imperial Decree”. This technique originates from an actual novel from what I believe is called “The Sword of Sushan” by Li Shoumin. “Tusita” is the name of one of six deva realms in Buddhism, its meaning is “Contentment/realm”. <a href="#footnote-ref-e2a6"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
