 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shh!” Her father quickly covered his mouth, his voice likewise trembling fiercely. “I’m n-not sure, b-b-but it can’t be a human!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know…” The person at his side used a blanket to tightly wrap himself as if doing so could reduce his presence. Merely, the chattering echo of his teeth betrayed him. “Is h-h-he going to get rid of everyone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had witnessed everything. They knew about how everything had occurred! That man at the center of the lake, holding a head and gripping a sphere that was filled with blue light in his hand… No, was he a man?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were stirred with emotion and excited because they had seen an unknown side of the world. They realized to their surprise that such things truly existed! Yet their terror… originated from the thought that not a single person felt Xu Yangyi to be a human!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was a human able to radiate light? Was a human capable of jumping ten meters? Was a human able to stand firm in a maelstrom, staunch and unflagging? Compared to this human-shaped creature, what even was a Hollywood blockbuster? The consideration of unrestrained might? This was a real superhuman!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The present scenery was quiet, devoid of sound. There were only cell phones filming everything in front of them as the people carried a complex feeling at the bottom of their hearts. Xu Yangyi simply didn’t care for others’ thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if power had been displayed before mortals? He would never regret, simply panting for air. The instant the blue radiance spread to the mountaintop, he could already sense a thread of a deep connection between the origin crystal and himself. Meanwhile, he seemed to hear the faint shout of a furious “No!!!” come from the ten-plus people on the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A disgrace!” An old man erupted with a heaven-shaking roar, the expression in his eyes like he wanted to take a fierce bite out of Xu Yangyi. His eyes suddenly reddened, and he charged over, nearly disregarding the consumption of his spiritual force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That twinkling… was the severing of Jadewave’s origin crystal to the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah…” The entire gown of a young lady in an evening dress flew up in the air. At this instant, her eyes were painfully shut and her lips were trembling. In the next second, her reddened eyes opened, and she charged towards the dead volcanic lake as she rigidly gritted her teeth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A monumental waste! A reckless squandering!” A sixty-plus-year-old woman suddenly raced towards the dead volcanic lake, her white hair rising upwards at the roots! Over yonder… they could all see a silhouette holding high its right hand, an origin crystal akin to a lighthouse in the dark night. That figure’s hand dazzled with a glow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they were Foundation Establishment cultivators… Even true cultivators of the late stage and Great Circle of Foundation Establishment were still unable to stymie the envy and jealousy in their eyes at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Core Formation origin crystal! The origin crystal of a millennium-old demon! It was an object that couldn’t be measured with wealth; this was to profane it. Its true price was without market! A supreme treasure never once seen in several centuries! Nonetheless, this origin crystal had recognized a master… but they couldn’t accept this in the slightest! If they didn’t see the demon core with their own eyes, how could they possibly be reconciled with the situation?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” Flying at the forefront was a sleepy-looking househusband. He was still even wearing slippers. It could be well-imagined that he had left home with great anxiety! Already… he could clearly see that silhouette, that of a young person. However, what this figure held high wasn’t the resplendent origin crystal, but rather…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavens Law student of the sixteenth graduation, Xu Yangyi, has executed a successor of God Ming at the Four Great Joint Pools!” Xu Yangyi’s voice traveled onwards to the four reaches!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” A man’s figure came to a sudden stop, looking incredulously at the location beyond!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did I hear that right?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A successor of God Ming?! A Qi Condensation cultivator?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A God Ming successor has been executed at the Four Great Joint Pools?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faint sound of cold gasps came out from the mouths of all the flying silhouettes. They almost collectively froze in step, looking at the lonely figure in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beneath the black night, that figure was covered with blood, yet he was like a sharp sword, straight and unbending. His face was colored by mud, sweat, and blood, but a handsome and masculine man could still be made out. In his hand, the head that he raised high into the air was like the crown of an emperor’s coronation, even more radiant than the origin crystal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a warrior’s crest. A man’s glory. Ten-odd rays of spiritual sense immediately twisted forward. They simply dared not believe that a God Ming successor had actually fallen in this place! What came soon after… was an expanse of deathly stillness! There weren’t any doubts whatsoever! This familiar silkworm aura… such a demonic aura brimming with killing intent… It was undoubtedly the Ming Clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is a God Ming successor…” The sleepy man looked at Xu Yangyi, lost in thought. His mind was practically a tangle of complex emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Ming Clan, the top figures below Core Formation… A demon of the great Ming Clan…” A young woman was a kilometer high in the sky, her evening dress rustling in the blowing wind. Her heart was terribly shaken. “3,000 disciples, 2,000 retainers, and ten grand elders… One of the twenty trained successors of this era’s God Ming has… actually… actually…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Actually met his demise here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young friend…” An old man stifled the trembling of his heart, his voice carrying a raspy understone, “Whose sect are you under? What is your specialization?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… is really a God Ming successor?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words were spoken at nearly the same time the old man opened his mouth. The old man was dazed. He couldn’t help but say these words upon seeing the somewhat absent-minded expression of a silhouette over a thousand meters away. Squinting his eyes, he sighed ruefully, “So it turned out to be a Fellow Daoist of the Sima Clan…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Indeed, this is a God Ming successor…” The evening-dressed young lady looked at the sharp sword-like figure in the black night, deeply eyeing Xu Yangyi’s gaze and firmly memorizing it in her heart. “Fellow Daoist Sima please look over there. It’s said… the Ming Clan possesses twenty coffins in total. The twentieth coffin is one of their strongest puppets. The top five are true engines of unparalleled massacre, but each puppet among the twenty coffins is not a target easily provoked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The head of the shadow called Sima moved and looked towards the broken upper-body of the three-headed demon beast. “This… is the tenth coffin… Chen Jintie’s corpse… I once traded blows with a Foundation Establishment expert of the Ming Clan in a troublesome place. It far exceeds the imaginations of all the Fellow Daoists…” A voice faintly echoed out. Soon after, the figure looked towards Xu Yangyi with incredible complexity. “Qi Condensation… Executing a God Ming successor… Young friend, you have good courage. And, good strength.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Foundation Establishment Senior’s praise! To be able to fly in the sky, one had to be at Foundation Establishment or above!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi raised the head high. Presently, he was at the peak of radiance; he possessed strength that brought everyone’s recognition! A Qi Condensation cultivator had slain a God Ming successor. Surveying the entire Qi Condensation realm, few individuals could accomplish this!</span></p>

He believed that concerning middle-stage Qi Condensation and himself, there weren’t many human cultivators capable of triumphing over him. Were it not for the final hidden ace he had laid down to reverse the tides, right now, the one left here wouldn’t be him!</span></p>

It was possible they wouldn’t even get past the sword formation of over twenty puppets! He possessed the grounds to be arrogant!</span></p>

Because at this very moment, three streaks of spiritual sense, boundless like the ocean, swept by with a simply unfathomable speed from three directions!</span></p>

Yet these spiritual senses… were terrifying in their vastness! They were comparable to the sea! Such a sensation was like the blotting of the heavens and the shrouding of the earth. It seemed that at this instant, this place, and this time, everything had been thoroughly grasped. Like the sprinkling of moonlight, there wasn’t one place that could escape.</span></p>

They all took a knee and clenched their teeth. “Respectful greetings, Ancestors!”</span></p>

No one delayed. No one objected. This was the influence of humanity’s overlords. Even though they were incarnations, none still dared to resist! Three silhouettes rumbled like hawks sweeping the sky. They suddenly charged over to the dead volcanic lake from different directions!</span></p>

His heart was presently beating like a drum. It wasn’t because he was scared he would be murdered and his treasure plundered. This wasn’t a novel. Instead… even if those immense spiritual pressures, like surging tides coming from three different directions, were deliberately suppressed, they would still make him feel as if he was at the heart of a storm! So long as they willed it, he would be destroyed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

However… they were merely images! The possessed no form nor shadow, nothing but faint, empty images! They seemed as if they could be blown apart by the yearly wind, and wisps of white qi slowly floated off their bodies, yet they ultimately didn’t dissipate. Furthermore… their faces simply couldn’t be clearly seen. Obviously, the turn of a head could be clearly felt, but not to speak of facial features, stature, or voice, nothing could be perceived.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even the wind now ceased to be. The insects of the night seemed to respond to something, quiet without so much as a chirp.&nbsp;</span></p>

Eventually, an androgynous voice with the likeness of great reed pipes, masterly and harmonious, rang out from the void, “Fellow Daoist Earthcleaver, Fellow Daoist Floatingcloud. This Dao Master believed my avatar to be the fastest. I didn’t expect that both of your avatars would likewise be undelayed.”</span></p>

This was the person… who had issued him the Black Kill Order, no reprieve until death! In his mind, an insane thought re-emerged! From the look of things, Floatingcloud still hadn’t told anyone about his Emperor Armament!</span></p>

A Core Formation cultivator that assisted the Chinese government!</span></p>

Immediately revolving qi around his entire body, Xu Yangyi used all of his strength to resist the three tidal waves of spiritual pressures and said clearly, “Heavens Law student of the sixteenth graduation, Paragon Xu Yangyi, has executed a God Ming successor at the Four Great Joint Pools!”</span></p>
