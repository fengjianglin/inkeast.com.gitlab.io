In the black night, a tremendous tongue came flipping. It was approximately several meters long, and it directly struck the body of a speeding black shadow. With a heavy sound, the black shadow suddenly dropped to the ground. The distance from her position… was only 2,000 to 3,000 meters away. This distance...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tiger King-03 painfully shut her eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the next second, her pupils nearly went slack, because Xu Yangyi had fished out a talisman from his pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit Traversing Talisman! It increased speed by 20% and lasted for ten minutes. She had just used it!</span></p>

Clenching her teeth, even if there wasn’t a single one of her bones in good condition, she covered her aching belly. She rigidly grinded her teeth, digging into the ground with both hands and crawling towards a distant place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Granted that she couldn’t escape too far, it was fine to conceal herself. If the other believed she would sit around resigned to death, then he was looking down on her by far. So long as one person escaped… she had absolute confidence that the branch master’s punishment would come swiftly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore… it was essential that she informed everyone that the target was a paragon! A paragon on the run! They couldn’t allow themselves to lower their guards in the slightest! A minor squadron would be cleanly eaten up… Only a group encirclement could be used. However, at this moment, a trembling voice passed on into her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… don’t move…” Glancing forward, she saw a youth and a hen-holding girl who was leveling a wooden sword with several talisman strung on it at her. The sword tip was wavering, but it was still aimed at her. She was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let… me… go…” Almost exhausting her total strength to say these words, she hacked up blood. “I’ll… give you… guys… a hundred… low-grade… spirit stones…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth shook his head. “Since I started jamming your signal downstairs, there’s no chance that I can let you off… and Mr. Xu’s reward is Dew Congealing Grass. Thirty catties of it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why the heck are you spewing so much crap! Do you like her, you damn wolf?!” The young girl snorted, “If she runs off, Mr. Xu is going to take good care of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tiger King-03 painfully closed her eyes. At this moment, the blackness was like a rushing tide. Her final hopes had been dashed away, and even if it was her, she could no longer support herself as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know how much time had passed when she woke up, but the bright moon was still up in the sky. Merely, her two compatriots were completely covered from head to toe in blood and standing at her side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi hung onto a cigarette, and Li Zongyuan stood at his side. Zhou Tingting, joined by the wolf-demon, was vigilantly using her wooden sword to level it at the three scouts, who were already without any strength to retaliate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each scout’s gaze carried disbelief and the gloom of their defeated confidence. They had traveled the line of life and death countless times and escaped from packs of demonbeasts while besieged on all sides. Yet today, the three of them had completely fallen here. Fallen into the hands of a single person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi deeply inhaled a puff of smoke, looking in satisfaction at the three sinister-minded people. Indeed, all he had done was make a call this afternoon. All for him to bait the terribly feeble wolf-demon, Zhou Tingting, and somewhat strong Li Zongyuan. They were his hidden trumps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Modern cultivation didn’t require a paper crane’s summon. All that was needed was a cell phone. He felt himself falling in love with modern cultivation. As he was arranging everything inside the room, the trio outside had continued to play the hunter, without the slightest trace of awareness. Meanwhile, he had made the toad, wolf, and girl do three things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First, he would make everyone completely focus on him. As for Li Zongyuan, he had to lay in ambush on the other party’s retreat path. Moreover, he would use his demon form to attack with his strongest blow. All that was requested was this strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Second, he had Zhou Tingting contact the wolf-demon to interfere with the scouts’ signal. Furthermore, the wolf-demon was to acquire a Spirit Traversing Talisman for him; Li Zongyuan would pay for it. After the wolf-demon got out of class, he would begin disrupting the signal. Xu Yangyi didn’t ask the wolf-demon about how it was done, so long as there was a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because he understood that these scouts were only the front line. The people behind them were the ones that truly wanted to find him. And as for these people, they were positively carrying communication devices. Putting himself in their position, he didn’t think that their first item of choice would be something besides a cell phone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regarding other communication measures they wanted to use, it was already late at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third… in case Zhou Tingting’s two-man squad discovered someone who had been defeated, they were to immediately take out their strongest weapon and pressure the other party. They could allow no one to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A so-called plan didn’t require that many complexities at all. The only thing required was the most suitable tactic put into effect at the most opportune time. The guarantee that a single strike would succeed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he would personally make an appearance and draw the opponents’ gazes. Thus, he would bloom with his full spiritual force and suddenly accelerate. Thus, he would explode with his entire cultivation, defeating Tiger King-03 in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all to make the other party pay total attention to him. Tonight, he wasn’t planning on letting one person escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quietly removing his finished cigarette, he used his flip-flops to stomp the butt out. The corners of Tiger King-03’s eyes twitched. It was this foot that had nearly wasted her with a kick.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re a paragon?” The camouflaged man’s wounds weren’t light, and he said hoarsely, “Even if you aren’t… you’re definitely in the top three…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve never fuckin’ seen your name on any list… If I saw it… there’s no way I wouldn’t have obtained this list…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi didn’t respond but rather nodded. “Are you going to talk? Or am I going to have to help you out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need…” The slim man was the one with with lightest injuries, and the person that Xu Yangyi had specifically left to speak. He gritted his teeth. “I’m Wind Trace-03, she’s Tiger King-03, and he’s Heaven Listener-04. We’re part of the Featherwood Guard’s Mingshui Province branch. We’re subordinate to the top three C-rank legions. These three legions have the best scouts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi laughed, “Not very resistant<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">,</span> are you?”</span></p>

C-rank is a legion of initial-stage and middle-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. After twenty bounties are completed, or a B-rank one, a legion can advance. B-rank is classified as a late-stage Qi Condensation and early-stage Foundation Establishment legion. The completion of an A-rank mission permits advancement. A-rank… They’re the most elite legion. There are Qi Condensation cultivators, Foundation Establishment seniors… there are no lack of seeds being nurtured, and there are plenty of teams that in themselves have powerful strength… Mingshui Province has three A-rank legions… The Hidden Dragon Legion headed by Chu Zhaonan, Senior Yu Xizhi’s Buried Flower Legion, and Senior Cao Mingyang’s Crouching Tiger Legion…”</span></p>

That kid… seemed to be getting by pretty well. So in the end, he had elected to join the Featherwood Guard? It wasn’t a Foundation Establishment legion, so it seemed to be a legion of nurtured seeds? Contrary to expectation, Xu Yangyi himself was the most suited to the Featherwood Guard’s promise back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled that Chu Zhaonan’s place of origin seemed to be Mingshui Province.

For example, there are only twenty-seven people in the Buried Flower Legion, but each one is an elite…” His gaze seamlessly swept across Xu Yangyi. This was a suggestion not to act against them, otherwise, any one the A-rank legions was capable of squeezing Xu Yangyi to death on a whim.</span></p>

Another old friend had passed on to the Western Paradises. At the same time, it caused him to further understand that on the path of cultivation, fortune and calamity were difficult to fathom, like treading across thin ice. <span id="footnote-ref-00ed"><a href="#footnote-00ed">[1]</a></span></span></p>

He calmly looked into the slim man’s eyes, and the slim man silently looked back. The man was hiding a fact. That fact was the branch master’s command: not dead until a corpse was seen!</span></p>

The present moment was equivalent to a battle of courage and wits. He understood that with such strength, this person was quite possibly a wanted criminal! Or perhaps a traitorous cultivator of the demons!&nbsp;</span></p>

There was only a single explanation… Because their enemy’s actions were unable to be publicly announced to the masses, he could only be secretly investigated, and his name stricken from Heavens Law.</span></p>

So long as they escaped, and after they returned, what would be awaiting Xu Yangyi wouldn’t just be the three of them! And then there was the entire Featherwood Guard’s Mingshui Province branch! Waves upon waves of tens of thousands of cultivators would plaster Xu Yangyi’s wanted name across heaven and earth!</span></p>

The other two people’s frightened eyes saucered, and they twisted about from head to toe yet were simply incapable of running! Even in the next second, the trio’s shocked expressions remained. They flailed about in disbelief.</span></p>

  <p>1. Western Paradises is a Buddhist term. In Buddhism, there is a concept of “pure lands” These pure lands are said to be where Amitabha Buddha recites his dharma. This western pure land has historically been known as “Sukhavati”. You may read in other novels that some people say “Amitabha Buddha”. The basis of saying this is in order to one day be reborn in this western pure land of Amitabha Buddha. <a href="#footnote-ref-00ed"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
