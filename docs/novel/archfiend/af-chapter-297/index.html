Seven white lights, as graceful as soaring goose! Along with the screams of white tigers, the riders suddenly charged out! Crackling noises rang out from the ground, and seven trenches that were almost a meter deep violently revealed themselves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cultivator allied with the Xingtian Legion and his fellow comrade were the same, forming seals at great speed! As the brink of crisis drew close, a black-white Taiji shockingly formed in front of them! It was twenty meters long and thirty meters tall, endlessly cycling! Qi scattered from the diagram, aimed at the seven white lights!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break!!!” The vice captain’s eyes threatened to split wide in fury, his voice quaking the air. Following his shout, a tremendous boom was heard! The riders and the Taiji had locked together, a solid blast wave of white qi spreading out at the impact site!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if responding to their intention, a crack surprisingly appeared on the Taiji!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break! Break! BREAK!” The vice captain wildly pulled at the reins of his mount! His black tiger stood on its hind legs and roared, their bodies becoming even more illusory! Their longevities burned even fiercer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crash!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Several seconds later, countless beams of alternating white-black light suddenly brightened on the diagram. The Taiji had actually broke apart in two! At the same time, the riders madly speared through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first blockade had been broken! And yet… in the instant they broke through, they discovered that there were three people standing behind the Taiji.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hiss…” Qin Xueluan licked her lips and hissed. At this moment, she was unlike any human. From head to toe, she was covered in scales, her lower-half shockingly transformed into a snake’s tail. Her tail had grown to be a full several meters long! Strange talismans ran up and down the length of her body, and her fingernails were jade-green. Her sides seemed to become a nest of the Five Venoms! Lingering poisonous toads, flying snakes, wasps, and scorpions filled an area of seven meters around her!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really don’t like this form…” Her scarlet snake tongue flicked out over her lips, a bloodthirsty arc rising at the crook of her mouth. “I’ll let everyone see how ugly the ‘Immortal Fall’ secret is. There won’t be need for words, I’m going to use your heads to prove it…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At her side was a young man dressed in white clothing. His expression was calm, and he held five compact puppets in his hand. Carefully, he arranged them on the ground and folded his hands afterwards, flying through hand seals! The five puppets on the ground radiated spiritual light that rose several meters high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Five streaks of qi dazzled the eye. After their passing, a massive five-headed ten-armed ape, no less than twenty meters tall, appeared on the battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you want to compare size…” Mo Yeyu sneered at the riders who thought they had broken free. “Of the top three clans, the Mo Clan is the sole inheritance of secret puppetry tomes. Rank 87th in the Mo Clan’s Tomes, Blood-Refined Vajra. Please confer your teaching.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“ROOAR!” Just as his voice fell, the arms of the giant vajra slammed down on its chest, a solid-like blast wave unexpectedly causing the black tigers below to fall back a step as their front claws trembled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… who brought them the most despair was the bald man in the middle. His body was covered in tattoos, and a scorpion coiled on the crown of his head. Now, the bald cultivator gingerly took out a black seed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s…” The instant the vice captain laid eyes upon the black seed, he nearly abandoned all hope. “A Spirit Void…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually recognize this?” Jun Man chuckled heartily and softly tossed the seed into the earth, his voice cold. “If there weren’t as many people as you, how could’ve I waited so long to start a massacre… so how about testing out the flavor of the Xingtian Legion’s counterattack now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh swoosh swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As soon as the black seed dug into the soil, it seemed to quickly contaminate the ground! Tracts of squirming blackness wildly creeped forth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice captain bit down hard. They had charged up to this point with great difficulty. He had never expected to face such a trio… Any one of these enemies had the power to contend against three or five of the Screaming Wind Legion alone! This was the true Xingtian Legion! This was their blockade line!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xingtian Legion didn’t have many people… but their elites were the cream of the crop, one chosen from amongst a hundred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black soil in front of them would seal all their deaths! On the ground, streaks of black qi vaguely spread, leaving no one with the desire to set foot on this land!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jun Man grinned icily and bit his finger. A drop of blood fell to the soil, and the black qi, having already extended tens of meters, seemed to come alive in an instant! Like a snake, it twisted onwards with great vigor! One could even hear a kind of strange, frightening noise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clack!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The vice captain gripped his spear. So moist… so slick… was his cold sweat. He gazed on in despair. After this blockade, one of the tigers had roared and collapsed, its body stabbed with an untold number of qi weapons. But in a minor battle like this, barely seven riders remained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind them was that person… the main culprit who had caused all of this. He himself dared not go against that man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ahead, three people firmly blocked their path! Regardless of that Blood-Refined Vajra, that terribly monstrous woman, or even the Spirit Void in front of them… all were like a heavenly moat, completely separating them from the hope of survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, they had slaughtered. Now was the time for them to finally settle the debt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huff…” He raised his head to look at the cold moon in the sky. As he entered battle, he had become complacent. Unexpectedly… a sword, merely one sword, had grounded his beautiful reality into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wholeheartedly embraced his lost to this sword, but even as he and his fellow riders were on the verge of being killed by these other insects, he wouldn’t accept it! Did middle-stage Qi Condensation deserve to encircle and kill the world-renown Screaming Wind Legion?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He squeezed his longspear, suddenly hefting it up. His voice thundered straight to the night sky. “Charge stance, advance! No retreat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six riders behind him suddenly realized something. They raised their spears towards the sky and roared together, “Break through enemy lines, we return to death unafraid!” <span id="footnote-ref-959f"><a href="#footnote-959f">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All forces…” In the vice captain’s gaze that seemed to suddenly calm, there was a wisp of absolute determination. His longspear pointed at the trio ahead. “CHARGE!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seven riders charged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">War chariots rumbling, and horses neighing, warriors with bow and arrow strapped at their waists. <span id="footnote-ref-5e2c"><a href="#footnote-5e2c">[2]</a></span> The reddened eyes and twisted faces of the Screaming Wind Legion clashed together with the heavy expressions and the hate-filled gazes of the Xingtian Legion and its allies, seemingly tangible. The eyes of both sides were red with murder. The Linghu Clan was going to completely exterminate the Xingtian Legion, yet they had suffered the enemy’s frontal assault!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew their names. Perhaps they had resounding names, or perhaps they were the Linghu Clan’s favored seeds. Maybe they were simply nameless cultivators. War buried too many such characters, and he was just another.</span></p>
