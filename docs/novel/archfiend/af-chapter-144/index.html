 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The body is a bodhi tree, and the mind is like an unblemished mirror. Constantly, we must strive to brush and wipe it, to not allow the irritation of dust. <span id="footnote-ref-c6c8"><a href="#footnote-c6c8">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As of now, Master Qingzhan could not attain this original realm of spotlessness, irritated by dust. He only felt… the vexation of the dust in his heart become increasingly greater! Yet his hand still didn’t come out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“20,000 going once,” Hundredtongues timely yelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Qingzhan’s snow-white brows were twitching. This price was truly too high. At most, a single Spirit Strengthening Pill was merely worth three or four medium-grade spirit stones, but this was the first Spirit Strengthening Pill after two centuries!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one cared for its efficacy. Everyone only wanted to research the Pill Dao’s pairing and techniques from it. This price was incalculable!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“20,000 going twice!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Qingzhan breathed in heavily. His hand faintly trembled for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“20,000 going three times! Sol…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A Sarira.” Finished speaking these words, Master Qingzhan guiltily exhaled three times in a row and wordlessly extended his hand. An irregular solid was floating over his palm, emitting drizzly golden light! <span id="footnote-ref-083f"><a href="#footnote-083f">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi studied the Sarira carefully. This was the first time he’d come in contact with such a true heavenly spirit-object. Even if it was separated far away from him, he was able to sense the majestic spiritual force contained within it! A hazy light-gold Buddha image slowly revolved in the Sarira, making it further appear incomparably holy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire floor was silent. Even the man from the Baili Clan was rendered completely foolish. Not only him, Hundredtongues and everyone below was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“S-S-Sarira?” Hundredtongues stuttered, silent for a second. In the next second, he cried out in alarm, “On the Worldly Oddity Ranking of Heaven, Earth, and Mortal, it ranks thirty-eighth on the Mortal Ranking. It is acquired from the seated death of a high-level Buddhist cultivator! Not only can it be compared to a demon core—used in the central focus of all formations—it can moreover assist a cultivator in a realm of enlightenment. Especially…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gulped, “According to legend… there only exists seventy-two Sariras in the world… When a new Sarira appears, the lowest-ranked Sarira will then transform into flying ash… A single Sarira corresponds to Buddhism’s seventy-two divine abilities. Each one possess its own forbidden name… Its value is a preliminary estimation of over 20,000 medium-grade spirit stones!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once its transcendent skill has been evaluated, the value will rise even more!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s actually even willing to part with a Sarira?!” Below, a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s eyes saucered. “The Longyin Temple is digging out their coffers! This is a truly priceless treasure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father.” Not too far away, a youth looked at the Sarira in Master Qingzhan’s hand with fascination. At this instant, he only felt the purification of his soul and the brightening of his eyes, spiritual sense penetrating the expanse. He asked unconsciously, “What is that thing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a treasure…” His father beside him was likewise starting at the Sarira, eyes locked onto this wondrous object. “A temple-protector treasure… They really are willing to part with it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist!” The very first to react was the Baili Clan youth who was looking on in amazement at the Sarira in Master Qingzhan’s hand. He then looked at Qingzhan and then towards the Sarira again, cycling back and forth like so. After an unknown passage of time, he said in shock, “Isn’t it too much for you to part with the Sarira?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This item had exceeded the price level within his heart! Master Qingzhan didn’t utter a word and gently beckoned. The Sarira immediately vanished without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This object’s name is Scarletcloud Gold.” Master Qingzhan looked at Hundredtongues and couldn’t restrain himself from slightly wincing because of his great heartache. “Its inherent divine ability… The Flowersmile Dhayanasliver.” <span id="footnote-ref-49d1"><a href="#footnote-49d1">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hiss…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grasping a flower with the fingers…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s actually such a divine ability… The pill master is going to make it big this time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seventy-two transcendent skills. Even if it’s a sliver of dhayana, this worth cannot be estimated!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My heavens, the flower sermon… Buddhism’s seventy-two transcendent skills… Really… the gambling for this first medicinal pill is crazy… How insane will the next one be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist… won’t the Core Formation ancestors put forth divine abilities, as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hiss… Core Formation divine ability?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first pill was merely a probe. Of the present dozens of clans, only one clan would possess this fortune. The rest had yet to even move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Qingzhan’s heart dripped with blood, yet his face was imposing and motionless. He faced towards the gobsmacked Hundredtongues and chanted. “Can a price be settled?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was then that Hundredtongues regained his wits amidst his shock. His voice crowing somewhat mechanically, he yelled, “A Sarira! The initial estimation is 20,000 medium-grade spirit stones! The contained Flowersmile divine ability is an increase of 5,000 medium-grade spirit stones! The total price is 25,000 medium-grade spirit stones! Going once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Baili Clan youth woke up from his reverie. His mouth opened a few times, yet not a single word left. This increase in price wasn’t possible. For a Qi Condensation medicinal pill, this price was simply astronomical! In particular… Master Qingzhan’s gaze watched him inconspicuously, brimming with ill feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of our Longyin Temple’s emblems. Do you still dare to increase the price? Are you planning on taking this outside and fighting things out with this poor monk? We’re both at the Great Circle of Foundation Establishment. Who’s afraid of who?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth knew that a vajra wasn’t limited to grasping flowers. It could moreover glower with furious eyes. <span id="footnote-ref-403d"><a href="#footnote-403d">[4]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“25,000 medium-grade spirit stones going twice!” Hundredtongues’s voice was throaty. Even though he wished someone would come increase the price again, his reason told him that this was impossible. In addition, Longyin Temple had ripped up all pretense of amiability. The weight of this price was so heavy that it was somewhat frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“25,000 medium-grade spirit stones going three times!” Hundredtongues clapped both of his hands in the air, making the sound of an auction gavel. “Sold!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Congratulations to Master Qingzhan of Wutai Mountain’s Longyin Temple for purchasing the first pill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In everyone’s gaze, a black medicinal pill—roiling hot as if solid—flew into Master Qingzhan’s hand. As this medicinal pill fell into his aged hand, everyone heard him sigh in relief from this heavy burden. Afterwards… tears began to surprisingly flood out from his eyes as he cried!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boohoo, boohoo…” His weeping was so muffled and quiet that it was almost inaudible, but everyone could clearly see him wiping tears. It was unknown whether he was crying tears of joy because he’d ultimately obtained the Pill Dao or because of the grief of losing one of Longyin Temple’s emblems. All that could be seen was Master Qingzhan, who was using his sleeve to cover his weeping face, and the few other senior monks who lent him an arm to sit down. However…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This damned Buddhist donkey!” The Baili Clan youth continued to gnash his teeth as he watched the high monk, yet he discovered that Master Qingzhan had acted with lightning speed to make the medicinal pill immediately vanish with an unknown talisman in his sleeve!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Endless Windshadow Talisman…” The Baili Clan youth sucked in deeply but couldn’t be severed from his rage. “Is able to take an object and deliver it to an assigned location in a single breath… This talisman is worth over 300 medium-grade spirit stones! Does the CSIB tax them?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master,” a cultivator as his side reminded him, his voice heavy, “Don’t mind them anymore. We… still have three more chances.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth’s gaze trembled and promptly turned grave. Yes, three, not four. The Bountiful Treasures Pavilion would participate once, so everyone automatically excluded that round. No one was looking to bring trouble upon themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The CSIB’s Ancestor Hiddenscent was currently set high and aloof in her arcane carriage, and needless to say, the Featherwood Guard’s Ancestor Ancientpine had already used practical action to tell everyone that he was here. For the first time, countless cultivators understood why he was called Flowing Light Imprisoning Shadow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Calling back to that prior sensation of their shadows being forcibly stripped away from their bodies… there wasn’t one person that didn’t get goose bumps! It was truly unknown where such a divine ability had been obtained. It was no wonder that Ancientpine had elected to take the reins of the Featherwood Guard. In the countryside, the ability was practically an all-conquering, sharp sword against demonbeasts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The venue’s clamor gradually lessened. Nonetheless, everyone could feel a silent, fiery heat even greater than before! The Baili Clan youth then turned his head and transmitted with his spiritual sense,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s the limit on the number of spirit stones that we can use?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">23,000, Young Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright…” the youth took a deep breath. “We&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">must</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;win… the second pill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundredtongues was an old hand at rousing the mood, having participated in an untold number of auctions. Undoubtedly, he understood the principle of striking while the iron was hot. Cupping his hands towards everyone forthwith, he laughed, “Fellow Daoists, I am indebted to your generous affections. The first medicinal pill has been sold at a perfect price. Now, let’s continue with the second pill’s auction!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jade bottle appeared again, yet this time, there were evidently many more restless clans! The first pill had already illustrated this. If they didn’t bleed out from their wallets, the pills would be out of reach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A price of 15,000 medium-grade spirit stones was the baseline! If this figure couldn’t be attained, one had to obediently move to the side and go play elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“18,000…” As these two words emerged, the Baili Clan youth was the first to stand. The second pill could only go the the Baili!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before he had even finished speaking, another mild voice rang out, “No matter the price anyone puts forth, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion will unconditionally add a thousand more medium-grade spirit stones as long as it isn’t a Core Formation ancestor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like so, the voice of the Baili Clan youth became stuck in his throat. He couldn’t approach nor could he leave. Everyone looked at him pitifully. This child… what was he in a rush for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe…” The Baili Clan youth forced laughter and sat down, his face thoroughly red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’ve finally made a move…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In everyone’s hearts, not only were they not nervous but instead sighing in relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blade was set over their heads, but everyone knew that which was most dreadful was this blade’s failure to descend. On the contrary, once it fell, they eased their breathing. Yet at the same time, they were at the pinnacle of jealousy! Money was simply not an issue for the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, the pavilion’s liaison didn’t expect their declaration would have this effect. However, he was a man of culture and looked over the auction floor, immediately standing and laughing, “If no one bids, I’m afraid this medicinal pill will be sold low. In that case, our pavilion will purchase the pill for 30,000 medium-grade spirit stones. In addition, we ask young friend Xu to carry a word to the pill master. So long as he is willing to cooperate with the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion, he may write down any price, and the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion will in no way object.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not one person opposed this, but immediately everyone’s gaze became even more fervent! Three times… All that remained was three chances! Perhaps the Core Formation ancestors above were waiting impatiently! Tens of clans! Three opportunities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone understood that each struggle would perhaps be a fatal combat of price!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the price was called three times, and in the wake of the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s fine storage ring flying over, Hundredtongues wisely didn’t stir the mood. The Bountiful Treasures Pavilion had bestowed face and respect, so for him to act in such a manner would be disrespectful. To the cultivation world’s top moneybags, this respect was right and proper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pavilion master of the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion was the sole cultivator able to stand on equal footing with a Core Formation master with the status of Great Circle Foundation Establishment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoists, I am indebted to your generous affections. The second pill has already been sold. There are still three remaining. May you all take good care of yourselves.” Hundredtongues laughed as he took out a medicinal pill and began the third auction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third and fourth pills were sold respectively for 24,000 and 27,000. They had been taken by the Baili Clan and a demon clan from Jianghan City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The auction house’s atmosphere burned like wildfire. Everyone stared fixedly at the final pill. This… was their final opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks to all the Fellow Daoists’ generous affections.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hundredtongues took out the fifth medicinal pill, also the last pill for the Foundation Establishment cultivators. Just as he was about ask for bids, Xu Yangyi’s gaze slightly flashed, and he said brightly, “Senior Hundredtongues, the Master said I’m required to personally auction this medicinal pill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This… was the first Minister pill he had refined! A three-mark Minister pill. Hundredtongues hadn’t looked carefully, yet Xu Yangyi saw it crystal clear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pill… He planned on selling it for a second sky-high price!</span></p>

  <p>3. “Flowersmile Dhayanasliver” This… is a translation I am iffy on. The literal Chinese is “Picking flowers and smiling of the sliver of Dhayana will.” There is a lot of religious undertone here, so I will explain it. The “Picking of Flowers and Laughing” is referring to an event in Buddhism called the Flower Sermon, considered the origin of “Zen Buddhism”. In this sermon, Sakyamuni Buddha transmits wisdom by only holding a flower to his disciple Mahakasyapa. Dhayana is the sanskrit name for what is known as concepts of “Chan”, “Zen”, “Seon” “Thein” in different cultures, all referring to the same thing. <a href="#footnote-ref-49d1"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
