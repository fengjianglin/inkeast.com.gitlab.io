However, just as his body moved, his head soon became wet with cold sweat and his four limbs firmly grounded themselves on the floor. He dared not move a hair.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though he couldn’t clearly see the man in front of him, he could feel that this man wasn’t even possibly as old as himself. But even separated ten-odd meters away by the massive rain curtain, he could sense the terror in the air!</span></p>

It seemed as long as the mysterious man willed it, he was capable of taking his life at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flying sword was very slow; at least in Xu Yangyi’s eyes that’s how it was. It swayed like a house fly, and its weak aura quite tempted him with the desire to slap it out of flight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where was this place?</span></p>

Not even compared with himself, but in comparison to Luo Sanfeng, Gao Ye, and the other champions. They were far inferior. If a comparison had to be made, he was presently Firecloud on that day and they were the cultivation clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the distance between the flying sword and the wolf-demon continued to close, the shivering of the demon’s body gradually became fiercer. He was close to using an appealing gaze, stealthily glancing at Xu Yangyi. While he wouldn’t die from being stabbed by this sword with his cultivation, he would be seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mysterious man in front of him could definitely save him! In his heart, he held this hope, not looking at the other’s clothing that was ruined like piled-up trash. However, so long as this man was willing to save him, he was absolutely capable of doing so!</span></p>

The sword instantly lost direction and shakily flew into his hand. Subsequently, his two fingers grabbed onto it, taking this kickass-sounding Heaven-Shattering Earth-Splitting World Annihilation Meteor Sword, pressing down on it. <span id="footnote-ref-84a1"><a href="#footnote-84a1">[1]</a></span></span></p>

This was a cultivator’s low-grade demonslayer edged-weapon from the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion that could cause him serious injuries…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet didn’t this man seem to be at the initial stage of Qi Condensation, as well? How could the difference be so great? The sword had just fluttered and stopped like that? It stopped? It came to an end!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Casually playing around with the peachwood sword like it was a lousy vegetable knife, Xu Yangyi suddenly asked, “How tall are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was quite soft and rather ordinary, yet it caused the wolf-demon to break out with a cold sweat from tail to snout. The demon dared not raise his head and said tremblingly, “1, 1.82 meters…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You got smokes?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi sighed and clicked his tongue, “Take off your clothes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes… Huh?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wolf-demon was rendered dumb. Take off his clothes? Had he heard that right? Nonetheless, even though he had doubts in his mind, his body honestly stood up in a flash. He started to shed his clothing. He was wearing a school uniform, one from some high school, and quickly took it off. After he took it off, he awkwardly held it in his hand and shortly afterwards discovered an even more awkward matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take off your pants.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiend, don’t move!” At this time, following an attractive and tender shout, a young girl and… a hen jumped out from not too far away with the grace of tigers. The young girl was dazed shortly afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of her… there was a man wearing tattered clothing who was forcing her prey to take off his pants… moreover, the pants were even half-shed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pervert!!!” After three seconds of silence, accompanied by the shrieks of a young girl and a hen, the human-chicken duo turned around in unison, using their hands and wings to respectively cover their faces. Their sharp voices reverberated throughout the grove.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Keep going.” Xu Yangyi’s expression didn’t change, beckoning towards the wolf-demon who was awkwardly holding onto his trousers and left only in his underwear. The wolf-demon’s face blushed red and pink, and he respectfully handed over his clothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The young girl reacted and turned her head around, angrily reprimanding, “Fiend… oh, my god!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi removed his belt neither slowly nor hurriedly and cast off his tattered camouflage clothing into the mud, not raising his head towards the young girl who swiftly turned around. “There’s no need to shout so loudly. In fact, you can turn around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Per! Vert!” The voices of a human and chicken amped up by eight decibels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clothes were quite well-fitting, and Xu Yangyi nodded. “Turn around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young girl and hen turned with reddened faces, In the next second, the young girl released a high-pitched shriek once more, “Pervert! Y-You put on some clothes, eeeehhhh!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wolf-demon felt that in his several decades of life, he had never lost so much face. In the summer, it was normal to only wear underwear. His clothes were swapped onto Xu Yangyi’s body right now, but the one being called a pervert… was him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, without Xu Yangyi’s nod, he dared not move. In the comparison of his self-esteem and his life, it was obvious that the latter was much more precious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… You… What are you thinking!” The young girl turned away. It was then that Xu Yangyi could clearly see her appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was quite normal, not pretty but not ugly, as well. She looked roughly sixteen or seventeen years old. There was a bit of baby’s fat on her face, and her hair was directly pulled back into a ponytail. She wore a cheap T-shirt and an even cheaper pair of jeans and sneakers. Her waist was pinned with a spacious belt and the front of it was fastened with several bags. If he hadn’t seen incorrectly, the insides were all of the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s lowest of the low’s demonslayer products. Items that he had used approximately for the first five years when he’d just entered Heavens Law.</span></p>

He’s only initial-stage Qi Condensation! The initial stage! He’s also a human cultivator!” The hen at the young girl’s side looked stealthily at Xu Yangyi from her wing, suddenly screeching, “Young Mistress! Be a bit reasonable! We should defend our interests!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi tilted his head and the wolf-demon immediately dodged behind a tree, only then letting loose a long sigh. There was no need to confront this man… This feeling of his naked body was a thousand times better!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hold on!” At the hen’s words and on top of the wolf-demon hiding behind a tree, the young girl immediately became worried. “What the heck are doing! Are you taking him under your wing?! This is my demon that I went through a ton of trouble to catch! The handling rights are mine! Furthermore! How did you get my magik treasure?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who did you catch?!” When the wolf-demon heard these words, his soul flew halfway out of his body! A human cultivator had just let him loose! If Xu Yangyi heard these words and his mood soured, what would he do if he was casually given away?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hiding behind the tree, he stuck out his head and cursed, “I just bumped into you guys! Is it okay for you to chase me?! Don’t chase me just because you say I’m a demon! Have you no shame?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you a demon?!”</span></p>

This really was a hopelessly convoluted story. As for the specifics… a tentative descendant of what was considered a demon slayer had fallen for a boy and wanted to pursue him. She didn’t pursue him, though, since it was said that the boy was a demon. Under her incessant pestering...</span></p>

This was just my honey trap! You… Which organization are you from! Be careful or I’ll go the Cultivation Court and sue you for harboring!”</span></p>

He took it without the least bit politeness and took a swig.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warm water seeped into his innermost core, and he sighed comfortably. Smiling as he raised a finger, a water drop drifted unhurriedly in the center of the trio. Soon after, he flicked it effortlessly, and a sound like a bullet hitting a tree crisply entered everyone’s ears! He furrowed his brows; the result wasn’t quite good. Ordinarily, the water drop should’ve been able to pierce through the tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hiss…” The wolf-demon coldly gasped. His vision was extremely good, and he already clearly saw the fist-sized hole that emerged on a large tree ten meters away!</span></p>

Afterwards, she immediately used her wing to cover her beak, looking at Xu Yangyi like she didn’t recognize him. The young girl’s mouth formed an O-shape in the very first moments of the water drop’s impact, and both her eyes went round as she looked at the tree. Eyes still wide, she looked over at Xu Yangyi. Looking at the tree in disbelief, she gazed incredulously at Xu Yangyi once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her gaze roamed endlessly between the person and the tree. Her noisy mouth tightly slammed close, and everyone looked at Xu Yangyi like he was a demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi closed his eyes and experienced the warm water moving around in his ice-cold chest. He then asked, “Where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mingshui Province’s Bai County… City.” The young girl immediately supplied an answer, standing up incredibly straight and proper. Her voice hovered between respect and docility, switching between the two rather well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A county-level city?</span></p>

It was no wonder that the standard of cultivators and demons here were so frighteningly low. In particular, a county and county-level city simply couldn’t have a branch from the Big Three, and that was granted some provincial-level cities at the fringes of the nation wouldn’t have one. Even if the Big Three wanted to spread out, they still didn’t have that many people.</span></p>

The weather seems to have brightened up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The torrential rain was still pouring down&nbsp;as before.
