 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None were any the wiser that below the water, a weak, indistinct spiritual sense was also paying attention to this region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The last… The last one… 3,600 years… The end is just about to arrive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Closer… Even closer…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Xu Yangyi already saw Wei Zhongxian, who had Dharma Wheels emerge at his head, his hands, and his legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black, white, violet, and azure… corresponding to four divine abilities. Four several-meter-wide halos lingered in the surroundings. The present Wei Zhongxian was terrible and awesome. His might directly pressured Core Formation! He couldn’t be viewed as just an initial-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Devour…” Ling Xiaozi’s explosion had already passed. Wei Zhongxian wasn’t even injured by a hair. From his emotionless mouth, the eunuch spat out the first word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“FUCK YOU!” Terrible anxiety weighed on Xu Yangyi’s heart. He was still several hundred meters away from Wei Zhongxian! There wasn’t enough time to cross the distance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stop! Stop! STOP!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, he frantically shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I won’t take this, I won’t stand for this! I definitely made it here! But this old inhuman dog of a castrate is going to kill me?! My great hatred still hasn’t been avenged, and I have the Eternal Alchemy Canon. How can I die here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do me a favor…” His hand pointed ahead, unwavering. “And shut! UP!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next second, he didn’t expect that countless vines would suddenly grew out from his palm! They was several times faster than his Chasing Skylark! The vines faced the wind, burgeoning ahead! Each one was no less than an arm thick! Countless barbs grew out from their surfaces! In a wink of time, they reined in Wei Zhongxian’s mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This!” Originally, Li Zongyuan was almost terrified out of his soul, yet he now shot up on his haunches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At his side, Mao Ba’er also sat up in fright, looking upon this scene incredulously!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fahui’s gaze was shaken, and the monk looked at Xu Yangyi with immense shock. “Demonization… He… He isn’t a pure human… but I’ve never heard of this kind among half-demons! No matter human or half-demon, such a type should be famous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This reining was only temporary, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a blink, Wei Zhongxian’s mouth was as large as when he’d devoured Ye Old Four. His jaws separated, opening up to a horrific degree like a snake, and spread wide again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light of Xu Yangyi’s eyes erupted. It seemed that as long as Wei Zhongxian was truly disrupted, he would have to start over again! And in these five seconds… he still needed seven seconds to charge across roughly a thousand meters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wei Zhongxian’s mouth flourished with golden light. Xu Yangyi could already see the complete view of that small box!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What to do… What was to be done! Was there something… that could truly interfere with the corpse puppet again? So long as it was one time! Once was enough! After one more time, he could storm over to Wei Zhongxian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He subconsciously traced his storage ring. The items inside basically couldn’t wound this Foundation Establishment corpse puppet! All of a sudden, his eyes shone. No… there was still one thing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Devour…” At this time, Wei Zhongxian had surprisingly chomped through the arm-thick vine, and a vague word came from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost simultaneously, a silver-white object shot out from Xu Yangyi’s hand and pierced straight towards Wei Zhongxian’s head! It… was the sword point from the Yellow Springs Path’s strange dimension! Just as this sword point was launched, the sky brightened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky wasn’t illuminated white… but rather pitch-black. In the sky where only vast tapestries pf violet talismans existed… boundless starlight suddenly flashed! Rays of golden light hung down from the sky. In an instant, white qi lotuses floated up on the water’s surface!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sensation that none could ignore, one that could even be said to be holy, soundlessly descended upon the world. It died away in the blink of an eye, but Xu Yangyi’s eyes quickly saucered! He thought back to a phrase. A phrase that Daomaster Jadewave had told him that day at the Four Great Joint Pools!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Starry Heavens Flower and Rootless Lotus. Golden light like muslin, power shakes Xuan Yuan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What… W-What is this?!?!?!” Beneath this mighty pressure, Fahui actually laid down on his stomach, wet with cold sweat. Terrible… Too terrible! This invisible sensation was practically akin to a god descending into the mortal world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Likewise, Xuan Chengzi kneeled on the ground, his teeth trembling. “What is this item… It’s too frightening… I’ve never experienced such an awful feeling…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword point had transformed into a resplendent golden light. With a speed beyond the naked eye, it rapidly charged Wei Zhongxian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;On the water’s surface, the palm-sized sword point brought forth a giant wave that was approximately a thousand meters tall! It was without the slightest warning, absent of any justification! Yet amidst the giant wave, this mote of golden light was first to arrive. Soon after, Xu Yangyi urgently rushed from behind like a deity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Zhongxian’s voice stopped for the first time. In his eyes, a wisp of consciousness actually appeared! Looking blankly at the sword point, he spoke his first conscious words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly Opening… Heavenly Opening… Heavenly… Opening… appear once more… Heavenly Opening… Ex… plosion…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who could speak weren’t of mind to. In Xu Yangyi’s heart, a heaven-flooding tsunami had already surged! The Tianqi Explosion… The Animus Armament… If this sword point was that item…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrible, hair-raising guess swiftly emerged in his mind. But! At this moment, he didn’t have the effort whatsoever to verify it. That was because… life and death would be spelled in this fleeting moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunk!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wei Zhongxian’s voice yet to fall, the sword point had already nailed firmly into his head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“SSRRAAAGHH!!!!!!” Without warning, a piercing screech tore through the vast sky! Wei Zhongxian’s wretched scream echoed. In an instant, all his bodily qi was shaking unsteadily! Nonetheless, in the next second, a hellish voice rang out again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Devour…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third time, the third time that the corpse’s voice rang out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s whole body had long since transformed into a blurry afterimage! His distance from Wei Zhongxian’s figure was already less than twenty meters! Three obstructions and three increases in speed! Life and death was here and now! However, Wei Zhongxian’s last move arrived even faster than everyone imagined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spirit… Uhh… raghh…” As the next word was said aloud, a fluctuation of unparalleled fear rapidly flickered in the sky! The clouds split open, and the sky seemed to subsequently crack apart. A terrible fiery mushroom cloud was faintly visible in the divided clouds above. Endless scarlet radiance fell down and reflected red clouds on the ocean surface!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, below intense red light, Xu Yangyi’s silhouette couldn’t be clearly discerned! Furthermore… it was unknown how far away he still was!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha…” Fahui closed his eyes and recited a chant. He said no more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Chengzi faced towards the sky and sighed deeply. “Junior Brother… I’m sorry. Senior Brother still won’t be able to live on…” He closed his eyes and was met with darkness. This was the best way to ignore death. And yet, a few seconds later… ten seconds later… the horrific spiritual force explosion didn’t arise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be…?” Fahui immediately opened his eyes. With a gaze of immense expectation and joyous surprise, he looked staunchly towards Wei Zhongxian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavens…” Zhao Wuye covered his mouth and trembled all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, God, Holy Mother, Allah, Mary, Jesus Christ…” The expression on Mao Ba’er’s canine face was one of total shock. He didn’t beggar belief, looking upon everything before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… This…” Xuan Chengzi’s lips were quivering. Looking at the sight before him, he suspected there was a problem with his eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Already, Xu Yangyi’s complexion was so choked that it was thoroughly red. A foot was stomping down on the teeth of Wei Zhongxian’s lower jaw, and a hand was propping up the teeth of Wei Zhongxian’s upper jaw! Xu Yangyi’s entire figure was wedged inside the incredibly large mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even now, the mouth was so braced that it deformed! From this vantage, Wei Zhongxian’s face couldn’t be seen at all. All that was visible was his exaggeratedly propped-open mouth! In the sky, the enormous fireball was already quietly falling back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drop by drop, blood spilled over onto Xu Yangyi’s leg from his hand. At the beginning, it was still a drop, but it immediately transformed into a stream after a brief moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck…” Xu Yangyi’s eyes were somewhat reddened. This monster’s jaws… were as sharp as blades! In this very instant, his hands were essentially holding onto a tract of sharp blades that were pushing down at full power! His foot was stomping down on blades that were forcibly closing upwards! He simply couldn’t resist a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s qi. Blood flowed down from his hands and dyed his lower-body red!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“TAKE THE NEXUS!!!” Zhao Wuye bellowed. Xu Yangyi’s fairly dim eyes brightened again. Exhausting all of his power, his other hand stretched into Wei Zhongxian’s mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, by this use of force, blood abruptly gushed out from his seven apertures! It was just like someone had grabbed onto him and forcefully squeezed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the explosion from moments ago had receded… he who was the closest to Wei Zhongxian suffered the greatest effect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, he already felt the inside of his body splitting open! His internal organs seemed to burn achingly! Each of his meridians were clamoring in pain and collapse. Were it not for absolute willpower fueling him, he would’ve long since fell into Wei Zhongxian’s mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No good… He couldn’t prop the jaws apart for long. In a flash, he understood the situation. His hands and feet were all fiercely shaking like he was having a stroke! At most, he had ten seconds! When he couldn’t hold on anymore was the time he would be torn into two pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart sparked in this time, and he searched for the box with his full strength. Yet as Xu Yangyi became more nervous and was unable to find the Animus Armament, the closing of Wei Zhongxian’s teeth drew increasingly near! At the start, it was a single person in height, but now it had already transformed into half a person! Already, he could sense the eerie chilliness of the other’s teeth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck!” He extracted each sliver of spiritual force from his entire body. This time, his extended hand finally touched an object.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Round… A familiar feeling. His heart relaxed, and he forcibly pulled out! Yet now, he suddenly felt that Wei Zhongxian’s teeth strength was madly increasing! It appeared… the corpse also understood that he couldn’t allow Xu Yangyi to pull out this item at any cost!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was to be done?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Xu Yangyi’s hand, the blood on his legs already caused his head to swoon and eyes to blur a little bit. Each extra second of perseverance was torture. He ruthlessly bit down on his tongue, causing his eyes to quickly sober. Carefully studying where his hand was grabbing the box, he then compared it to his own position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes glimmered with a shred of absolute determination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be willing to part with something… To abandon something willfully… To reluctantly let go, where would gain come from?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without warning, his entire body withdrew from Wei Zhongxian’s ridiculously large and deep mouth!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart… from his hand holding the box.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">CRUNCH!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a heavy groan, Xu Yangyi pulled his head back and gasped. A sharp pain that he’d never felt spread from his left arm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the last instant, his left arm and his body lost connection. He steeled his heart and consumed his full power, tearing out the Animus Armament’s lower half!</span></p>
