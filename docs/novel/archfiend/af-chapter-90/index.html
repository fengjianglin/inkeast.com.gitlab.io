Yet at this moment, his pupils suddenly needled. Soon after—his body at an impossible angle to an ordinary person—he faced back in midair and turned, unceremoniously jumping off Li Zongyuan’s back, who was running.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven Eye!” Simultaneously, he snarled lowly and his eye turned blood-red in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dear god!” At the other side, the bearded man yelped in fright. He confirmed once more that this was in no way a person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The demon form went unseen by him, so he only saw that after the humanoid creature charged towards the mountain top, it turned around high in the sky, and like so… it had stopped in midair?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?!” At this moment, the urgent voice of a man rang out at his side. A slim middle-aged man pushed the bearded man away, his complexion flushed as he zoned in on the digital camcorder. “Old Zhou! You fuck, you didn’t frickin’ call me! You went and shot a a collection of this thing… I-Is this a mountain god?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know how many times I called you!” Old Zhou was also nervous, and the two men crammed in together. Their heads seemed as long as a bundle of sticks, and they dared not breathe loudly, their eyes unblinkingly trained on the digital camcorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master?” Just as Li Zongyuan opened his mouth, he felt the front of his eyes abruptly turn cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A drop of liquid had dripped onto Xu Yangyi’s forehead. Xu Yangyi customarily extended his tongue and licked, his eyes suddenly alight. This… was blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huh…” Xu Yangyi half-crouched on Li Zongyuan’s back and patted the other’s head, making a silent signal. He grimly gazed up in the air. Beneath the Heaven Eye, there was none that could hide. He finally saw… at the mouth of the Old Black Mountain volcano, stretching all around for an unknown distance… a boundless silver thread like a spider web!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if the dead volcano had been inserted with a mirror-thin cicada wing that was parallel to the ground. The moonlight reflected on this surface projected a deathly luminescence! Xu Yangyi didn’t doubt at all that if weren’t for the swiftness of his response, perhaps he would’ve just been completely torn apart into pieces! <span id="footnote-ref-5ba4"><a href="#footnote-5ba4">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if his reaction was fast enough, at that moment, seven to eight bloody scars had appeared on his arm, somewhat sinking into his flesh. Blood trickled down from his arm like a fountain, dripping onto Li Zongyuan’s body below. He stretched his arms, his expression calm. This was the first time he had sustained an injury since the graduation ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spectral figure appeared at the mountain top. Away from the light, its appearance couldn’t be clearly seen. A voice like a rusty blade grinded. “The Ming Clan is handling affairs. Solicitors withdraw.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi laughed. With a gentle pull, his body climbed up the rock face once again. In a single leap, he arrived below the large formation of silk. He extended a finger and lightly flicked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huuummm…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A noise like a chiming bell rang out from the silk, and the silver thread, fine as a hair, softly trembled. Subsequently, the first thread spread over to ten, ten spilled over to a hundred, and a hundred circulated among the myriad of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huuuummmm…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Countless threads vibrated at the same time, causing the heart to tremble! Between them, only a single arm could be accommodated for entry. No one saw that atop the man’s Baihui meridian, a black hair extended forth, creeping a thousand meters away to the side of pool water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over yonder, there was a glossy rock like a mirror. A young man with a well-tailored suit stood on a stone that was roughly four to five meters wide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was approximately twenty-seven or twenty-eight. His expression was placid, a place absent of too much color. There was merely a red vertical line between his brows, and a shawl of long silver hair that draped behind him. He gently rocked a folding fan in his hand, not a bamboo one, but rather a fan of silk surface and jade structure. The white fan’s face slightly unfolded in both of his jade hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On a pavilion of ten li, we bid farewell under a frosty autumn sky… Our hair black, the years past, when we meet, will it be white…?” His appearance wasn’t handsome and it moreover wasn’t beautiful, yet it possessed a kind of graceful magnificence, an eminent and unapproachable temperament. Perhaps his appearance wouldn’t stick out from the masses, but if he walked within a crowd, he would surely become the focus of attention. <span id="footnote-ref-e09b"><a href="#footnote-e09b">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this life, regret not the opportunity missed… If fate brings us together in the next life, may our affections persist.” He faintly sighed and unfolded his fan with a swish. “Someone has come at Fourteen’s position.” <span id="footnote-ref-ec40"><a href="#footnote-ec40">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him wasn’t a shawl of long hair, but rather… boundless silver locks! Like flooding mercury, they spread forth on the ground! They extended a thousand meters… Over ten thousand meters! It covered the volcanic lake with a layer of silver silk weave!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterwards, it spread out again, seemingly infinite, filling the entire night sky! Like a mirror’s surface in the sky, the screen formation was surprisingly weaved from his long silver hair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord God, are we required to assist?” Behind him were three elderly men wearing tunic suits, their cultivations shockingly at the late stage of Qi Condensation. However, they were extremely deferential to this young man. As for the young man, he had no more than just recently trod into the middle stage of Qi Condensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unnecessary.” The man called Lord God quietly closed his folding fan, looking at the mirroresque surface of the several-thousand-meter dead volcanic lake and mumbling, “Senior Jadewave’s appointed time is coming. I haven’t met Senior for ages, as well. I shall respectfully welcome the elder.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for that moth…” He used his folding fan to lightly strike his palm. Originally, his suit, folding fan, and cape of hair were completely inharmonious things, yet they seemed to fuse together naturally on his person. “To come here at twelve o’clock at midnight, the moment of the witching hour, this person has presumably come here for a decryption request, as well. If he’s able to come, I will make him kneel at my side and give him an opportunity once I have finished my questions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An old man slightly bowed, laughing, “Lord is benevolent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In a place a hundred meters distant above Xu Yangyi, fine sandstone rolled down. A shadow walked above him, looking down on him against the moonlight. He discovered it was a forty-somewhat-year-old man without the sliver of an expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man was dressed in a tunic suit. However, his eyes were devoid of a trace of vigor, and his entire person also lacked the slightest temperature. Even his walking posture was somewhat mechanical, like he were a corpse that had just crawled out from the cemetery. Chillingly looking at Xu Yangyi, he repeated, “The Ming Clan is handling affairs. Solicitors withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gulp…” At this time, behind Xu Yangyi, Li Zongyuan said oddly, “S-Sir, he’s not a human.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other had already transformed into his human form at some unknown time. Xu Yangyi’s gaze swept pass, and his brows immediately began to furrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zongyuan’s entire face suddenly sprouted a few warts and then receded straightaway. In one second, the toad-demon’s eyes turned to the size of copper bells, his eye sockets bulged, and his pupils scattered, yet in the next, they transformed back into human shape. Wisps of black mist were radiating from his body and yellow liquid came out freely from his seven apertures… At a glance, Xu Yangyi knew that perhaps Li Zongyuan’s demon form would manifest.</span></p>

I-I don’t know why.”</span></p>

In the era of war between the Yellow Emperor and Chiyou… this was their name. In the modern age… cough, cough, cough… they’re known as silkworms…” <span id="footnote-ref-7b0a"><a href="#footnote-7b0a">[4]</a></span></span></p>

The other possessed no compelling reason to save him. The anxiety within his eyes was almost palpable. Within his body, his blood and qi were at a complete boil. Xu Yangyi looked at him for three seconds and nodded.</span></p>

The Ming Clan… He had read a few records about them. As a human cultivator, some of the demonkind’s great powers had to be clearly understood. For example, the Ming Clan, a heritage of over a millennium. They had nearly witnessed half of China’s historical development. From under their family, they had previously produced three Core Formation cultivators. While this quantity appeared not to be many, they were number one within the same realm of Core Formation!</span></p>

Even if the Ming Clan hadn’t produced a Core Formation demon in the past several centuries, their rank in the top five of China’s demon clans was almost ironed and nailed in place!</span></p>

Another’s obstruction in disallowing assistance was never a justification! Even supposing Xu Yangyi threw Li Zongyuan away and then kicked him, that was his matter as well. As for his affairs… no one was ever permitted to interfere!</span></p>

He sensed… in the direction of Fourteen, a heart-churning qi condensing in the air at an astonishing rate! It shook his heart… to the extent that he felt his emotions stir!</span></p>
